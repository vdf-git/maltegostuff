{"subject": "Consecration", "text": "The Twilight to my Star,\nHer hoary head\nA Hope receding far,\nTo Life re-led.\nApart and poor I lay;\nMy fevered frame\nSlow withering away,\nWhen soft she came,\nFrom comfort, to my care;\nAnd Pity sweet\nSubdued her, kneeling there,\nTo kiss my feet.\nA Magdalen adored\nHer God in Thee:-\nA greater love, O Lord,\nAnointed me."}
