{"subject": "Ye Flowery Banks (Bonie Doon)", "text": "Ye flowery banks o' bonnie Doon, \nHow can ye blume sae fair?\nHow can ye chant, ye little birds,\nAnd I sae fu' o' care? \n\nThou'll break my heart, thou bonie bird,\nThat sings upon the bough;\nThou minds me o' the happy days,\nWhen my false love was true. \n\nThou'll break my heart, thou bonnie bird,\nThat sings beside thy mate;\nFor sae I sat, and sae I sang,\nAnd wist na o' my fate. \n\nAft hae I roved by bonnie Doon\nTo see the wood-bine twine,\nAnd ilka bird sang o' its luve,\nAnd sae did I o' mine. \n\nWi' lightsome heart I pulled a rose\nFrae aff its thorny tree;\nAnd my false luver stole my rose\nBut left the thorn wi' me."}
