{"subject": "In Tara's Halls", "text": "A MAN I praise that once in Tara's Hals\nSaid to the woman on his knees, 'Lie still.\nMy hundredth year is at an end.  I think\nThat something is about to happen, I think\nThat the adventure of old age begins.\nTo many women I have said, ''Lie still,''\nAnd given everything a woman needs,\nA roof, good clothes, passion, love perhaps,\nBut never asked for love; should I ask that,\nI shall be old indeed.'\nThereon the man\nWent to the Sacred House and stood between\nThe golden plough and harrow and spoke aloud\nThat all attendants and the casual crowd might hear.\n'God I have loved, but should I ask return\nOf God or woman, the time were come to die.'\nHe bade, his hundred and first year at end,\nDiggers and carpenters make grave and coffin;\nSaw that the grave was deep, the coffin sound,\nSummoned the generations of his house,\nLay in the coffin, stopped his breath and died."}
