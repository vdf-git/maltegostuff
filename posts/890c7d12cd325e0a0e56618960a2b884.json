{"subject": "On A Corkscrew", "text": "Though I, alas! a prisoner be,\nMy trade is prisoners to set free.\nNo slave his lord's commands obeys\nWith such insinuating ways.\nMy genius piercing, sharp, and bright,\nWherein the men of wit delight.\nThe clergy keep me for their ease,\nAnd turn and wind me as they please.\nA new and wondrous art I show\nOf raising spirits from below;\nIn scarlet some, and some in white;\nThey rise, walk round, yet never fright.\nIn at each mouth the spirits pass,\nDistinctly seen as through a glass:\nO'er head and body make a rout,\nAnd drive at last all secrets out;\nAnd still, the more I show my art,\nThe more they open every heart.\nA greater chemist none than I\nWho, from materials hard and dry,\nHave taught men to extract with skill\nMore precious juice than from a still.\nAlthough I'm often out of case,\nI'm not ashamed to show my face.\nThough at the tables of the great\nI near the sideboard take my seat;\nYet the plain 'squire, when dinner's done,\nIs never pleased till I make one;\nHe kindly bids me near him stand,\nAnd often takes me by the hand.\nI twice a-day a-hunting go;\nNor ever fail to seize my foe;\nAnd when I have him by the poll,\nI drag him upwards from his hole;\nThough some are of so stubborn kind,\nI'm forced to leave a limb behind.\nI hourly wait some fatal end;\nFor I can break, but scorn to bend."}
