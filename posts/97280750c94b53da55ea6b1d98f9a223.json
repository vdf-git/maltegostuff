{"subject": "He turns to his wife, 1797", "text": "You turn away from me in the fragrant heat \nOf this Montenotte summer - \nYou are besieged with the bustle of parenthood, \nMore fatally besieged than I could ever be. \n\nI watch the children cling to your waking hours, \nClinging as if their lives depended on you \nFor clean air, apples, for Olympian favours. \nI am neither nurse nor mother, but distant \n\nWith the precise tables of a marine clerk; \nI am the scrivener, merely, of their triumphs - \nMiss Callanan, I kiss the laurels on your shoulder \nAs you drowse beside me; you grown warm \n\nWith the radiant sandstone of August. \nYour whippet lies lazy beside us, his black \nMuzzle moist with dreams, your worn trug \nFull of redcurrants overturned. \n\nThe heat of the city rises to our land \nTo sit upon your head like a crown. \nPeace in our land, a peaceable Kingdom, \nAn English century seems peaceably to wind down \n\nAfter the storms of regicide. \nShips out of France begin to trade once more, \nThe New World prospers. \nA Murphy coaster skims the tide. \n\nShips like children attend to you, \nForever seeking you on the far shore - \nMinerva in the summer's medallion, \nPerfectly at ease after Mercury's wars."}
