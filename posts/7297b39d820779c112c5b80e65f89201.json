{"subject": "Open The Gate", "text": "Open the gate, my love,\nArise and open the gate,\nFor my soul is dismayed\nAnd sorely afraid\nAnd Hagar's brood mocks my estate.\n\nThe heart of the hand-maid's sons\nIs hateful and haughty grown,\nAnd all because of the cry\nOf Ishmael piercing the sky,\nAscending and reaching the Throne.\n\nI stumble 'twixt beast and beast,\nThe wild ass swift to slay\nHas followed my flight\nFrom the courts of Night\nWhere crushed of the boar I lay.\n\nAlas! for my thick-sealed fate,\nAh woe for the days to come!\nIt helps but to pain me\nThat none can explain me,\nAnd I, myself, I am dumb.\nTranslated by Israel Zangwill"}
