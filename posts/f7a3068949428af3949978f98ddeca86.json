{"subject": "Past", "text": "The clocks are chiming in my heart\nTheir cobweb chime;\nOld murmurings of days that die,\nThe sob of things a-drifting by.\nThe clocks are chiming in my heart!\n\nThe stars have twinkled, and gone out--\nFair candles blown!\nThe hot desires burn low, and wan\nThose ashy fires, that flamed anon.\nThe stars have twinkled, and gone out."}
