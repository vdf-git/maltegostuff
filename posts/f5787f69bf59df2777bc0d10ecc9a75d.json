{"subject": "Hell's Half Acre", "text": "Six years of life in the reek of things\nWhere love is a fay unknown;\nA wolfish boy on the crowded street\nWho stoops for the cruel stone;\nNo laughter-light in his infant eyes,\n  No joy and no baby shame.\n'Tis Hell's Half Acre has made him thus\n  And we are the ones to blame.\n\nOh, look you well at the rosy lad\n  Who sits on your knee to-night,\nHis arms entwining about your neck,\n  His big round eyes alight.\nOh, list you well to his silver laugh\n  Which echoes on Heaven's street,\nTill the angels smile as they pause to hear\n  The sound so glad and sweet.\n\nYour boy is filled with the joy of love;\n  He knows your protecting hand.\nIt keeps him out of the Lake of Lies\n  'Mid the hills of Hopeless Land.\nAnd yet his brother, a child of woe,\n  Is living in black despair\nIn Hell's Half Acre, and you and I\n  Are willing to leave him there.\n\nGod help the child of a devil's home\n  With his broken-hearted sigh.\nHe cringes low in his filthy rags,\n  A curse for his lullaby.\nSix years of life in the reek of things\n  Where God is an empty name.\n'Tis Hell's Half Acre, beside our doors,\n  And we are the ones to blame."}
