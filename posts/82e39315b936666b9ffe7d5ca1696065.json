{"subject": "Child Ballad", "text": "Jesus, He loves one and all,\nJesus, He loves children small,\nTheir souls are waiting round His feet\nOn high, before His mercy-seat.\n\nWhile He wandered here below\nChildren small to Him did go,\nAt His feet they knelt and prayed,\nOn their heads His hands He laid.\n\nCame a Spirit on them then,\nBetter than of mighty men,\nA Spirit faithful, pure and mild,\nA Spirit fit for king and child.\n\nOh! that Spirit give to me,\nJesu Lord, where'er I be!\n1847."}
