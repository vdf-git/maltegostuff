{"subject": "The Trap", "text": "I am not well civilized, really alien here: trust me not.\nI can understand the guns and the airplanes,\nThe other conveniences leave me cold.\n\n'We must adjust our economics to the new abundance .\nOf what? Toys: motors, music-boxes,\nPaper, fine clothes, leisure, diversion.\n\nI honestly believe (but really an alien here: trust me not)\nBlind war, compared to this kind of life,\nHas nobility, famine has dignity.\n\nBe happy, adjust your economics to the new abundance;\nOne is neither saint nor devil, to wish\nThe intolerable nobler alternative."}
