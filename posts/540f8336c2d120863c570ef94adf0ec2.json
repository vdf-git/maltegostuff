{"subject": "The Zenana", "text": "WHAT is there that the world hath not \nGathered in yon enchanted spot?\nWhere, pale, and with a languid eye,\nThe fair Sultana listlessly\nLeans on her silken couch, and dreams\nOf mountain airs, and mountain streams.\nSweet though the music float around,\nIt wants the old familiar sound;\n\nAnd fragrant though the flowers are breathing,\nFrom far and near together wreathing,\nThey are not those she used to wear,\nUpon the midnight of her hair.\u2014\n\nShe's very young, and childhood's days\nWith all their old remembered ways,\nThe empire of her heart contest\nWith love, that is so new a guest;\nWhen blushing with her Murad near,\nHalf timid bliss, half sweetest fear,\nE'en the beloved past is dim,\nPast, present, future, merge in him.\nBut he, the warrior and the chief,\nHis hours of happiness are brief;\nAnd he must leave Nadira's side\nTo woo and win a ruder bride;\n\nSought, sword in hand and spur on heel,\nThe fame, that weds with blood and steel.\nAnd while from Delhi far away,\nHis youthful bride pines through the day,\nWeary and sad: thus when again\nHe seeks to bind love's loosen'd chain;\nHe finds the tears are scarcely dry\nUpon a cheek whose bloom is faded,\nThe very flush of victory\nIs, like the brow he watches, shaded.\nA thousand thoughts are at her heart,\nHis image paramount o'er all,\nYet not all his, the tears that start,\nAs mournful memories recall\nScenes of another home, which yet\nThat fond young heart can not forget.\nShe thinks upon that place of pride,\nWhich frowned upon the mountain's side;\n\nWhile round it spread the ancient plain,\nHer steps will never cross again.\nAnd near those mighty temples stand,\nThe miracles of mortal hand,\nWhere, hidden from the common eye,\nThe past's long buried secrets lie,\nThose mysteries of the first great creed,\nWhose mystic fancies were the seed\nOf every wild and vain belief,\nThat held o'er man their empire brief,\nAnd turned beneath a southern sky,\nAll that was faith to poetry.\nHence had the Grecian fables birth,\nAnd wandered beautiful o'er earth;\nTill every wood, and stream, and cave,\nShelter to some bright vision gave:\nFor all of terrible and strange,\nThat from those gloomy caverns sprung,\n\nFrom Greece received a graceful change,\nThat spoke another sky and tongue,\nA finer eye, a gentler hand,\nThan in their native Hindoo land.\n\n'Twas thence Nadira came, and still\nHer memory kept that lofty hill;\nThe vale below, her place of birth,\nThat one charmed spot, her native earth.\nStill haunted by that early love,\nWhich youth can feel, and youth alone;\nAn eager, ready, tenderness,\nTo all its after-life unknown.\nWhen the full heart its magic flings,\nAlike o'er rare and common things,\nThe dew of morning's earliest hour,\nWhich swells but once from leaf and flower,\n\nFrom the pure life within supplied,\nA sweet but soon exhausted tide.\n\nThere falls a shadow on the gloom,\nThere steals a light step through the room,\nGentle as love, that, though so near,\nNo sound hath caught the list'ning ear.\nA moment's fond watch o'er her keeping.\nMurad beholds Nadira weeping;\nHe who to win her lightest smile,\nHad given his heart's best blood the while.\nShe turned\u2014a beautiful delight\nHas flushed the pale one into rose,\nMurad, her love, returned to-night,\nHer tears, what recks she now of those?\nDried in the full heart's crimson ray,\nEre he can kiss those tears away\u2014\n\nAnd she is seated at his feet,\nToo timid his dear eyes to meet;\nBut happy; for she knows whose brow\nIs bending fondly o'er her now.\nAnd eager, for his sake, to hear\nThe records red of sword and spear,\nFor his sake feels the colour rise,\nHis spirit kindle in her eyes,\nTill her heart beating joins the cry\nOf Murad, and of Victory.\n\nCity of glories now no more,\nHis camp extends by Bejapore,\nWhere the Mahratta's haughty race\nHas won the Moslem conqueror's place;\nA bolder prince now fills the throne,\nAnd he will struggle for his own.\n\n'And yet,' he said, 'when evening falls\nSolemn above those mouldering walls,\nWhere the mosques cleave the starry air,\nDeserted at their hour of prayer,\nAnd rises Ibrahim's lonely tomb,\n'Mid weed-grown shrines, and ruined towers,\nAll marked with that eternal gloom\nLeft by the past to present hours.\nWhen human pride and human sway\nHave run their circle of decay;\nAnd, mocking\u2014the funereal stone,\nAlone attests its builder gone.\nOh! vain such temple, o'er the sleep\nWhich none remain to watch or weep.\nI could not choose but think how vain\nThe struggle fierce for worthless gain.\nAnd calm and bright the moon looked down\nO'er the white shrines of that fair town;\n\nWhile heavily the cocoa-tree\nDrooped o'er the walls its panoply,\nA warrior proud, whose crested head\nBends mournful o'er the recent dead,\nAnd shadows deep athwart the plain\nUsurp the silver moonbeam's reign;\nFor every ruined building cast\nShadows, like memories of the past.\nAnd not a sound the wind brought nigh,\nSave the far jackal's wailing cry,\nAnd that came from the field now red\nWith the fierce banquet I had spread:\nAccursed and unnatural feast,\nFor worm, and fly, and bird, and beast;\nWhile round me earth and heaven recorded\nThe folly of life's desperate game,\nAnd the cold justice still awarded\nBy time, which makes all lots the same.\n\nSlayer or slain, it matters not,\nWe struggle, perish, are forgot!\nThe earth grows green above the gone,\nAnd the calm heaven looks sternly on.\n'Twas folly this\u2014the gloomy night\nFled before morning's orient light;\nCity and river owned its power,\nAnd I, too, gladdened with the hour;\nI saw my own far tents extend\nMy own proud crescent o'er them bend;\nI heard the trumpet's glorious voice\nSummon the warriors of my choice.\nAgain impatient on to lead,\nI sprang upon my raven steed,\nAgain I felt my father's blood\nPour through my veins its burning flood.\nMy scimetar around I swung,\nForth to the air its lightning sprung,\n\nA beautiful and fiery light,\nThe meteor of the coming fight.\n\n'I turned from each forgotten grave\nTo others, which the name they bear\nWill long from old oblivion save\nThe heroes of the race I share.\nI thought upon the lonely isle\nWhere sleeps the lion-king the while,\n\nWho looked on death, yet paused to die\nTill comraded by Victory.\nAnd he, fire noblest of my line,\nWhose tomb is now the warrior's shrine,\n(Where I were well content to be,\nSo that such fame might live with me.)\nThe light of peace, the storm of war,\nLord of the earth, our proud Akbar.\n'What though our passing day but be\nA bubble on eternity;\nSmall though the circle is, yet still\n'Tis ours to colour at our will.\nMine be that consciousness of life\nWhich has its energies from strife,\nWhich lives its utmost, knows its power,\nClaims from the mind its utmost dower\u2014\n\nWith fiery pulse, and ready hand,\nThat wills, and willing wins command\u2014\nThat boldly takes from earth its best\u2014\nTo whom the grave can be but rest.\nMine the fierce free existence spent\nMid meeting ranks and armed tent:\u2014\nSave the few moments which I steal\nAt thy beloved feet to kneel\u2014\nAnd own the warrior's wild career\nHas no such joy as waits him here\u2014\nWhen all that hope can dream is hung\nUpon the music of thy tongue.\nAh! never is that cherished face\nBanished from its accustomed place\u2014\nIt shines upon my weariest night\nIt leads me on in thickest fight:\nAll that seems most opposed to be\nIs yet associate with thee\u2014\n\nTogether life and thee depart,\nDream\u2014idol\u2014treasure of my heart.'\n\nAgain, again Murad must wield\nHis scimetar in battle-field:\nAnd must he leave his lonely flower\nTo pine in solitary bower?\nHas power no aid has wealth no charm,\nThe weight of absence to disarm?\nAlas! she will not touch her lute\u2014\nWhat!\u2014sing?\u2014and not for Murad's ear?\nThe echo of the heart is mute,\nAnd that alone makes music dear.\nIn vain, in vain that royal hall\nIs decked as for a festival.\nThe sunny birds, whose shining wings\nSeem as if bathed in golden springs,\n\nThough worth the gems they cost\u2014and fair\nAs those which knew her earlier care.\nThe flowers\u2014though there the rose expand\nThe sweetest depths wind ever fanned.\nAh! earth and sky have loveliest hues\u2014\nBut none to match that dearest red,\nBorn of the heart, which still renews\nThe life that on itself is fed.\nThe maiden whom we love bestows\nHer magic on the haunted rose.\nSuch was the colour\u2014when her cheek\nSpoke what the lip might never speak.\nThe crimson flush which could confess\nAll that we hoped\u2014but dared not guess.\nThat blush which through the world is known\nTo love, and to the rose alone\u2014\nA sweet companionship, which never\nThe poet's dreaming eye may sever.\n\nAnd there were tulips, whose rich leaves\nThe rainbow's dying light receives;\nFor only summer sun and skies\nCould lend to earth such radiant dyes;\nBut still the earth will have its share,\nThe stem is green\u2014the foliage fair\u2014\nThose coronals of gems but glow\nOver the withered heart below\u2014\nThat one dark spot, like passion's fire,\nConsuming with its own desire.\nAnd pale, as one who dares not turn\nUpon her inmost thoughts, and learn,\nIf it be love their depths conceal,\nLove she alone is doomed to feel\u2014\nThe jasmine droopeth mournfully\nOver the bright anemone,\nThe summer's proud and sun-burnt child:\nIn vain the queen is not beguiled,\n\nThey waste their bloom. Nadira's eye\nNeglects them\u2014let them pine and die.\nAh! birds and flowers may not suffice\nThe heart that throbs with stronger ties.\nAgain, again Murad is gone,\nAgain his young bride weeps alone:\nSeeks her old nurse, to win her ear\nWith magic stories once so dear,\nAnd calls the Almas to her aid.\nWith graceful dance, and gentle singing,\nAnd bells like those some desert home\nHears from the camel's neck far ringing.\nAlas! she will not raise her brow;\nYet stay\u2014some spell hath caught her now:\nThat melody has touched her heart.\nOh, triumph of Zilara's art;\nShe listens to the mournful strain,\nAnd bids her sing that song again.\n\nSong.\n'My lonely lute, how can I ask\nFor music from thy silent strings?\nIt is too sorrowful a task,\nWhen only swept by memory's wings:\nYet waken from thy charmed sleep,\nAlthough I wake thee but to weep.\n\n'Yet once I had a thousand songs,\nAs now I have but only one.\nAh, love, whate'er to thee belongs.\nWith all life's other links, has done;\nAnd I can breathe no other words\nThan thou hast left upon the chords.\n\n'They say Camdeo's place of rest, \nWhen floating down the Ganges' tide,\nIs in the languid lotus breast,\nAmid whose sweets he loves to hide.\nOh, false and cruel, though divine,\nWhat dost thou in so fair a shrine?\n\n'And such the hearts that thou dost choose,\nAs pure, as fair, to shelter thee;\nAlas! they know not what they lose\nWho chance thy dwelling-place to be.\nFor, never more in happy dream\nWill they float down life's sunny stream.\n\n'My gentle lute, repeat one name,\nThe very soul of love, and thine:\nNo; sleep in silence, let me frame\nSome other love to image mine;\n\nSteal sadness from another's tone,\nI dare not trust me with my own.\n\n'Thy chords will win their mournful way,\nAll treasured thoughts to them belong;\nFor things it were so hard to say\nAre murmured easily in song\u2014\nIt is for music to impart\nThe secrets of the burthened heart.\n\n'Go, taught by misery and love,\nAnd thou hast spells for every ear:\nBut the sweet skill each pulse to move,\nAlas! hath bought its knowledge dear\u2014\nBought by the wretchedness of years,\nA whole life dedicate to tears.'\n\nThe voice has ceased, the chords are mute,\nThe singer droops upon her lute;\n\nBut, oh, the fulness of each tone\nStraight to Nadira's heart hath gone\u2014\nAs if that mournful song revealed\nDepths in that heart till then concealed,\nA world of melancholy thought,\nThen only into being brought;\nThose tender mysteries of the soul,\nLike words on an enchanted scroll,\nWhose mystic meaning but appears\nWhen washed and understood by tears.\nShe gaged upon the singer's face;\nDeeply that young brow wore the trace\nOf years that leave their stamp behind:\nThe wearied hope\u2014the fever'd mind\u2014\nThe heart which on itself hath turned,\nWorn out with feelings\u2014slighted\u2014spurned\u2014\nTill scarce one throb remained to show\nWhat warm emotions slept below,\n\nNever to be renewed again,\nAnd known but by remembered pain.\n\nHer cheek was pale\u2014impassioned pale\u2014\nLike ashes white with former fire,\nPassion which might no more prevail,\nThe rose had been its own sweet pyre.\nYou gazed upon the large black eyes,\nAnd felt what unshed tears were there;\nDeep, gloomy, wild, like midnight skies,\nWhen storms are heavy on the air\u2014\nAnd on the small red lip sat scorn,\nWrithing from what the past had borne.\nBut far too proud to sigh\u2014the will,\nThough crushed, subdued, was haughty still;\nLast refuge of the spirit's pain,\nWhich finds endurance in disdain.\n\nOthers wore blossoms in their hair,\nAnd golden bangles round the arm.\nShe took no pride in being fair,\nThe gay delight of youth to charm;\nThe softer wish of love to please,\nWhat had she now to do with these?\nShe knew herself a bartered slave,\nWhose only refuge was the grave.\nUnsoftened now by those sweet notes,\nWhich half subdued the grief they told,\nHer long black hair neglected floats\nO'er that wan face, like marble cold;\nAnd carelessly her listless hand\nWandered above her lute's command\nBut silently\u2014or just a tone\nWoke into music, and was gone.\n\n'Come hither, maiden, take thy seat,'\nNadira said, 'here at my feet.'\n\nAnd, with the sweetness of a child\nWho smiles, and deems all else must smile,\nShe gave the blossoms which she held,\nAnd praised the singer's skill the while;\nThen started with a sad surprise,\nFor tears were in the stranger's eyes.\nAh, only those who rarely know\nKind words, can tell how sweet they seem.\nGreat God, that there are those below\nTo whom such words are like a dream.\n\n'Come,' said the young Sultana, 'come\nTo our lone garden by the river,\nWhere summer hath its loveliest home,\nAnd where Camdeo fills his quiver.\nIf, as thou sayest, 'tis stored with flowers,\nWhere will he find them fair as ours?\nAnd the sweet songs which thou canst sing\nMethinks might charm away his sting.'\n\nThe evening banquet soon is spread\u2014\nThere the pomegranate's rougher red\nWas cloven, that it might disclose\nA colour stolen from the rose\u2014\nThe brown pistachio's glossy shell,\nThe citron where faint odours dwell;\nAnd near the watermelon stands,\nFresh from the Jumna's shining sands;\nAnd golden grapes, whose bloom and hue\nWear morning light and morning dew,\nOr purple with the deepest dye\nThat flushes evening's farewell sky.\nAnd in the slender vases glow\u2014\nVases that seem like sculptured snow\u2014\nThe rich sherbets are sparkling bright\nWith ruby and with amber light.\nA fragrant mat the ground o'erspread,\nWith an old tamarind overhead,\n\nWith drooping bough of darkest green,\nForms for their feast a pleasant screen.\n\n'Tis night, but such delicious time\nWould seem like day in northern clime.\nA pure and holy element,\nWhere light and shade, together blent,\nAre like the mind's high atmosphere,\nWhen hope is calm, and heaven is near.\nThe moon is young\u2014her crescent brow\nWears its ethereal beauty now,\nUnconscious of the crime and care,\nWhich even her brief reign must know,\nTill she will pine to be so fair,\nWith such a weary world below.\nA tremulous and silvery beam\nMelts over palace, garden, stream;\n\nEach flower beneath that tranquil ray,\nWears other beauty than by day,\nAll pale as if with love, and lose\nTheir rich variety of hues\u2014\nBut ah, that languid loveliness\nHath magic, to the noon unknown,\nA deep and pensive tenderness,\nThe heart at once feels is its own\u2014\nHow fragrant to these dewy hours,\nThe white magnolia lifts its urn\nThe very Araby of flowers,\nWherein all precious odours burn.\nAnd when the wind disperses these,\nThe faint scent of the lemon trees\nMingles with that rich sigh which dwells\nWithin the baubool's golden bells. \n\nThe dark green peepul's glossy leaves, \nLike mirrors each a ray receives,\nWhile luminous the moonlight falls,\nO'er pearl kiosk and marble walls,\nThose graceful palaces that stand\nMost like the work of peri-land.\nAnd rippling to the lovely shore,\nThe river tremulous with light,\nOn its small waves, is covered o'er\nWith the sweet offerings of the night\u2014\nHeaps of that scented grass whose bands\nHave all been wove by pious hands,\nOr wreaths, where fragrantly combined,\nRed and white lotus flowers are twined.\nAnd on the deep blue waters float\nMany a cocoa-nut's small boat,\n\nHolding within the lamp which bears\nThe maiden's dearest hopes and prayers,\nWatch'd far as ever eye can see,\nA vain but tender augury.\nAlas! this world is not his home,\nAnd still love trusts that signs will come\nFrom his own native world of bliss,\nTo guide him through the shades of this.\nDreams, omens, he delights in these,\nFor love is linked with fantasies,\nBut hark! upon the plaining wind\nZilara's music floats again;\nThat midnight breeze could never find\nA meeter echo than that strain,\nSad as the sobbing gale that sweeps\nThe last sere leaf which autumn keeps,\n\nYet sweet as when the waters fall\nAnd make some lone glade musical.\nSong.\n'Lady, sweet Lady, song of mine\nWas never meant for thee,\nI sing but from my heart, and thine\u2014\nIt cannot beat with me.\n\n'You have not knelt in vain despair,\nBeneath a love as vain,\nThat desperate\u2014that devoted love,\nLife never knows again.\n\n'What know you of a weary hope,\nThe fatal and the fond,\nThat feels it has no home on earth,\nYet dares not look beyond?\n\n'The bitterness of wasted youth,\nImpatient of its tears;\nThe dreary days, the feverish nights,\nThe long account of years.\n\n'The vain regret, the dream destroy'd,\nThe vacancy of heart,\nWhen life's illusions, one by one,\nFirst darken\u2014then depart.\n\n'The vacant heart! ah, worse,\u2014a shrine\nFor one beloved name:\nKept, not a blessing, but a curse,\nAmid remorse and shame.\n\n'To know how deep, how pure, how true\nYour early feelings were;\nBut mock'd, betray'd, disdain'd, and chang'd,\nThey have but left despair.\n\n'And yet the happy and the young\nBear in their hearts a well\nOf gentlest, kindliest sympathy,\nWhere tears unbidden dwell.\n\n'Then, lady, listen to my lute;\nAs angels look below,\nAnd e'en in heaven pause to weep\nO'er grief they cannot know.'\n\nThe song was o'er, but yet the strings\nMade melancholy murmurings;\nShe wandered on from air to air,\nChangeful as fancies when they bear\nThe impress of the various thought,\nFrom memory's twilight caverns brought.\nAt length, one wild, peculiar chime\nRecalled this tale of ancient time.\nTHE RAKI. \n'There's dust upon the distant wind, and shadow on the skies,\nAnd anxiously the maiden strains her long-expecting eyes\nAnd fancies she can catch the light far flashing from the sword,\nAnd see the silver crescents raised, of him, the Mogul lord.\n\n'She stands upon a lofty tower, and gazes o'er the plain:\nAlas! that eyes so beautiful, should turn on heaven in vain.\n'Tis but a sudden storm whose weight is darkening on the air,\nThe lightning sweeps the hill, but shows no coming warriors there.\n\n'Yet crimson as the morning ray, she wears the robe of pride\nThat binds the gallant Humaioon, a brother, to her side;\nHis gift, what time around his arm, the glittering band was rolled,\nWith stars of ev'ry precious stone enwrought in shining gold.\n'Bound by the Raki's sacred tie, his ready aid to yield,\nThough beauty waited in the bower, and glory in the field:\nWhy comes he not, that chieftain vow'd, to this her hour of need?\nHas honour no devotedness? Has chivalry no speed?\n\n'The Rajpoot's daughter gazes round, she sees the plain afar,\nSpread shining to the sun, which lights no trace of coming war.\nThe very storm has past away, as neither earth nor heaven\nOne token of their sympathy had to her anguish given.\n\n'And still more hopeless than when last she on their camp looked down,\nThe foeman's gathered numbers close round the devoted town:\nAnd daily in that fatal trench her chosen soldiers fall,\nAnd spread themselves, a rampart vain, around that ruined wall.\n\n'Her eyes upon her city turn\u2014alas! what can they meet,\nBut famine, and despair, and death, in every lonely street?\nWomen and children wander pale, or with despairing eye\nLook farewell to their native hearths, and lay them down to die.\n\n'She seeks her palace, where her court collects in mournful bands,\nOf maidens who but watch and weep, and wring their weary hands.\n\nOne word there came from her white lips, one word, she spoke no more;\nBut that word was for life and death, the young queen named\u2014the Jojr.\n\n[ the last,\n'A wild shriek filled those palace halls\u2014one shriek, it was\nAll womanish complaint and wail have in its utterance past:\nThey kneel at Kurnavati's feet, they bathe her hands in tears,\nThen hurrying to their task of death, each calm and stern appears.\n\n'There is a mighty cavern close beside the palace gate,\nDark, gloomy temple, meet to make such sacrifice to fate:\nThere heap they up all precious woods, the sandal and the rose,\nWhile fragrant oils and essences like some sweet river flows.\n\n'And shawls from rich Cashmere, and robes from Dacca's golden loom,\nAnd caskets filled with Orient pearls, or yet more rare perfume:\n\nAnd lutes and wreaths, all graceful toys, of woman's gentle care,\nAre heaped upon that royal pile, the general doom to share.\n\n'But weep for those the human things, so lovely and so young,\nThe panting hearts which still to life so passionately clung;\nSome bound to this dear earth by hope, and some by love's strong thrall,\nAnd yet dishonour's high disdain was paramount with all.\n\n'Her silver robe flowed to her feet, with jewels circled round,\nAnd in her long and raven hair the regal gems were bound;\nAnd diamonds blaze, ruby and pearl were glittering in her zone,\nAnd there, with starry emeralds set, the radiant Kandjar shone. \n\n'The youthful Ranee led the way, while in her glorious eyes\nShone spiritual, the clear deep light, that is in moonlit skies:\n\nPale and resolved, her noble brow was worthy of a race\nWhose proud blood flowed in those blue veins unconscious of disgrace.\n'Solemn and slow with mournful chaunt, come that devoted band,\nAnd Kurnavati follows last\u2014the red torch in her hand:\nShe fires the pile, a death-black smoke mounts from that dreary cave\u2014\nFling back the city gates\u2014the foe, can now find but a grave.\n\n'Hark the fierce music on the wind, the atabal, the gong,\nThe stem avenger is behind, he has not tarried long:\nThey brought his summons, though he stood before his plighted bride;\nThey brought his summons, though he stood in all but victory's pride.\n\n'Yet down he flung the bridal wreath, he left the field unwon,\nAll that a warrior might achieve, young Humaioon had done,\nToo late\u2014he saw the reddening sky, he saw the smoke arise,\nA few faint stragglers lived to tell the Ranee's sacrifice.\n'But still the monarch held a sword, and had a debt to pay;\nSmall cause had Buhadour to boast\u2014the triumph of that day:\nAgain the lone streets flowed with blood, and though too late to save,\nVengeance was the funereal rite at Kurnavati's grave.'\n\nDeep silence chained the listeners round,\nWhen, lo, another plaintive sound,\nCame from the river's side, and there\nThey saw a girl with loosened hair\n\nSeat her beneath a peepul tree,\nWhere swung her gurrah mournfully, \nFilled with the cool and limpid wave,\nAn offering o'er some dear one's grave.\nAt once Zilara caught the tone,\nAnd made it, as she sung, her own.\nSong.\n'Oh weep not o'er the quiet grave,\nAlthough the spirit lost be near;\nWeep not, for well those phantoms know\nHow vain the grief above their bier.\n\nWeep not\u2014ah no, 'tis best to die,\nEre all of bloom from life is fled;\nWhy live, when feelings, friends, and faith\nHave long been numbered with the dead?\n\n'They know no rainbow-hope that weeps\nItself away to deepest shade;\nNor love, whose very happiness\nShould make the trusting heart afraid.\nAh, human tears are tears of fire,\nThat scorch and wither as they flow;\nThen let them fall for those who live,\nAnd not for those who sleep below.\n\n'Yes, weep for those, whose silver chain\nHas long been loosed, and yet live on;\nThe doomed to drink from life's dark spring,\nWhose golden bowl has long been gone.\n\nAye, weep for those, the weary, worn,\nThe bound to earth by some vain tie;\nSome lingering love, some fond regret,\nWho loathe to live, yet fear to die.'\n\nA moment's rest, and then once more\nZilara tried her memory's store,\nAnd woke, while o'er the strings she bowed,\nA tale of Rajahstan the proud.\nKISHEN KOWER. \n'Bold as the falcon that faces the sun,\nWild as the streams when in torrents they run,\n\nFierce as the flame when the jungle's on fire,\nAre the chieftains who call on the day-star as Sire.\nSince the Moghuls were driven from stately Mandoo,\nAnd left but their ruins their reign to renew,\nThose hills have paid tribute to no foreign lord,\nAnd their children have kept what they won by the sword.\nYet downcast each forehead, a sullen dismay\nAt Oudeypoor reigns in the Durbar to-day, \nFor bootless the struggle, and weary the fight,\nWhich Adjeit Sing pictures with frown black as night:\u2014\n\n'Oh fatal the hour, when Makundra's dark pass\nSaw the blood of our bravest sink red in the grass;\nAnd the gifts which were destined to honour the bride,\nBy the contest of rivals in crimson were dyed.\nWhere are the warriors who once wont to stand\nThe glory and rampart of Rajahstan's land?\nAsk of the hills for their young and their brave,\nThey will point to the valleys beneath as their grave.\nThe mother sits pale by her desolate hearth,\nAnd weeps o'er the infant an orphan from birth;\nWhile the eldest boy watches the dust on the spear,\nWhich as yet his weak hand is unable to rear.\nThe fruit is ungathered, the harvest unsown,\nAnd the vulture exults o'er our fields as his own:\nThere is famine on earth\u2014there is plague in the air,\nAnd all for a woman whose face is too fair.'\nThere was silence like that from the tomb, for no sound\nWas heard from the chieftains who darkened around,\n\nWhen the voice of a woman arose in reply,\n'The daughters of Rajahstan know how to die.'\n\n'Day breaks, and the earliest glory of morn\nAfar o'er the tops of the mountains is borne;\nThen the young Kishen Kower wandered through the green bowers,\nThat sheltered the bloom of the island of flowers;\nWhere a fair summer palace arose mid the shade,\nWhich a thousand broad trees for the noon-hour had made\nFar around spread the hills with their varying hue,\nFrom the deepest of purple to faintest of blue;\nOn one side the courts of the Rana are spread,\nThe white marble studded with granite's deep red;\nWhile far sweeps the terrace, and rises the dome,\nTill lost in the pure clouds above like a home.\nBeside is a lake covered over with isles,\nAs the face of a beauty is varied with smiles:\n\nSome small, just a nest for the heron that springs\nFrom the long grass, and flashes the light from its wings;\nSome bearing one palm-tree, the stately and fair,\nAlone like a column aloft in the air;\nWhile others have shrubs and sweet plants that extend\nTheir boughs to the stream o'er whose mirror they bend.\nThe lily that queen-like uprears to the sun,\nThe loveliest face that his light is upon;\nWhile beside stands the cypress, which darkens the wave\nWith a foliage meant only to shadow the grave.\n\nBut the isle in the midst was the fairest of all\nWhere ran the carved trellis around the light hall;\nWhere the green creeper's starry wreaths, scented and bright.\nWooed the small purple doves 'mid their shelter to light;\nThere the proud oleander with white tufts was hung,\nAnd the fragile clematis its silver showers flung,\n\nAnd the nutmeg's soft pink was near lost in the pride\nOf the pomegranate blossom that blushed at its side.\nThere the butterflies flitted around on the leaves,\nFrom which every wing its own colour receives;\nThere the scarlet finch past like a light on the wind,\nAnd the hues of the bayas like sunbeams combined;\nTill the dazzled eye sought from such splendours to rove\nAnd rested at last on the soft lilac dove;\nWhose song seemed a dirge that at evening should be\nPour'd forth from the height of the sad cypress tree.\nHer long dark hair plaited with gold on each braid;\nHer feet bound with jewels which flash'd through the shade;\nOne hand filled with blossoms, pure hyacinth bells\nWhich treasure the summer's first breath in their cells;\nThe other caressing her white antelope,\nIn all the young beauty of life and of hope.\nThe princess roved onwards, her heart in her eyes,\nThat sought their delight in the fair earth and skies.\n\nOh, loveliest time! oh, happiest day!\nWhen the heart is unconscious, and knows not its sway,\nWhen the favourite bird, or the earliest flower,\nOr the crouching fawn's eyes, make the joy of the hour,\nAnd the spirits and steps are as light as the sleep\nWhich never has waken'd to watch or to weep.\nShe bounds o'er the soft grass, half woman half child,\nAs gay as her antelope, almost as wild.\nThe bloom of her cheek is like that on her years;\nShe has never known pain, she has never known tears,\nAnd thought has no grief, and no fear to impart;\nThe shadow of Eden is yet on her heart.\n\n'The midnight has fallen, the quiet, the deep,\nYet in yon Zenana none lie down for sleep.\nLike frighted birds gathered in timorous bands,\nThe young slaves within it are wringing their hands.\n\nThe mother hath covered her head with her veil,\nShe weepeth no tears, and she maketh no wail;\nBut all that lone chamber pass silently by;\nShe has flung her on earth, to despair and to die.\nBut a lamp is yet burning in one dismal room,\nYoung princess; where now is thy morning of bloom?\nAh, ages, long ages, have passed in a breath,\nAnd life's bitter knowledge has heralded death.\nAt the edge of the musnud she bends on her knee, \nWhile her eyes watch the face of the stern Chand Baee. \nProud, beautiful, fierce; while she gazes, the tone\nOf those high murky features grows almost her own;\nAnd the blood of her race rushes dark to her brow,\nThe spirit of heroes has entered her now.\n\n' 'Bring the death-cup, and never for my sake shall shame\nQuell the pride of my house, or dishonour its name.\nShe drained the sherbet, while Chand Baee looked on,\nLike a warrior that marks the career of his son.\nBut life is so strong in each pure azure vein,\nThat they take not the venom\u2014she drains it again.\nThe haughty eye closes, the white teeth are set,\nAnd the dew-damps of pain on the wrung brow are wet:\nThe slight frame is writhing\u2014she sinks to the ground;\nShe yields to no struggle, she utters no sound\u2014\nThe small hands are clenched\u2014they relax\u2014it is past,\nAnd her aunt kneels beside her\u2014kneels weeping at last.\nAgain morning breaks over palace and lake,\nBut where are the glad eyes it wont to awake.\nWeep, weep, 'mid a bright world of beauty and bloom,\nFor the sweet human flower that lies low in the tomb.\nAnd wild through the palace the death-song is breathing,\nAnd white are the blossoms, the slaves weep while wreathing,\n\nTo strew at the feet and to bind round the head,\nOf her who was numbered last night with the dead:\nThey braid her long tresses, they drop the shroud o'er,\nAnd gaze on her cold and pale beauty no more:\nBut the heart has her image, and long after-years\nWill keep her sad memory with music and tears.'\n\nDays pass, yet still Zilara's song\nBeguiled the regal beauty's hours\nAs the wind bears some bird along\nOver the haunted orange bowers.\n'Twas as till then she had not known\nHow much her heart had for its own;\nAnd Murad's image seemed more dear,\nThese higher chords of feeling strung;\n'And love shone brighter for the shade\n'That others' sorrows round it flung.\n\nIt was one sultry noon, yet sweet\nThe air which through the matted grass\nCame cool\u2014its breezes had to meet\nA hundred plumes, ere it could pass;\nThe peacock's shining feathers wave\nFrom many a young and graceful slave;\nWho silent kneel amid the gloom\nOf that dim and perfumed room.\n\nBeyond, the radiant sunbeams rest\nOn many a minaret's glittering crest,\nAnd white the dazzling tombs below,\nLike masses sculptured of pure snow;\nWhile round stands many a giant tree,\nLike pillars of a sanctuary,\nWhose glossy foliage, dark and bright,\nReflects, and yet excludes the light.\nOh sun, how glad thy rays are shed;\nHow canst thou glory o'er the dead?\n\nAh, folly this of human pride,\nWhat are the dead to one like thee,\nWhose mirror is the mighty tide,\nWhere time flows to eternity?\nA single race, a single age,\nWhat are they in thy pilgrimage?\nThe tent, the palace, and the tomb\nRepeat the universal doom.\nMan passes, but upon the plain\nStill the sweet seasons hold their reign,\nAs if earth were their sole domain,\nAnd man a toy and mockery thrown\nUpon the world he deems his own.\n\nAll is so calm\u2014the sunny air\nHas not a current nor a shade;\nThe vivid green the rice-fields wear\nSeems of one moveless emerald made;\n\nThe Ganges' quiet waves are rolled\nIn one broad sheet of molten gold;\nAnd in the tufted brakes beside,\nThe water-fowls and herons hide.\nAnd the still earth might also seem\nThe strange creation of a dream.\nActual, breathless\u2014dead, yet bright\u2014\nUnblest with life\u2014yet mocked with light,\nIt mocks our nature's fate and power,\nWhen we look forth in such an hour,\nAnd that repose in nature see,\nThe fond desire of every heart;\nBut, oh! thou inner world, to thee,\nWhat outward world can e'er impart?\n\nBut turn we to that darkened hall,\nWhere the cool fountain's pleasant fall\n\nWakens the odours yet unshed\nFrom the blue hyacinth's drooping head;\nAnd on the crimson couch beside\nReclines the young and royal bride;\nNot sleeping, though the water's chime,\nThe lulling flowers, the languid time,\nMight soothe her to the gentlest sleep,\nO'er which the genii watchings keep,\nAnd shed from their enchanted wings,\nAll loveliest imaginings:\nNo, there is murmuring in her ear,\nA voice than sleep's more soft and dear;\nWhile that pale slave with drooping eye\nSpeaks mournfully of days gone by;\nAnd every plaintive word is fraught\nWith music which the heart has taught,\nA pleading and confiding tone,\nTo those mute lips so long unknown.\n\nAh! all in vain that she had said\nTo feeling, 'slumber like the dead;'\nHad bade each pang that might convulse\nWith fiery throb the beating pulse,\nEach faded hope, each early dream,\nSleep as beneath a frozen stream;\nSuch as her native mountains bear,\nThe cold white hills around Jerdair;\nHeights clad with that eternal snow,\nWhich happier valleys never know.\nSome star in that ungenial sky,\nMight well shape such a destiny;\nBut till within the dark calm grave,\nThere yet will run an under-wave,\nWhich human sympathy can still\nExcite and melt to tears at will;\nNo magic any spell affords,\nWhose power is like a few kind words.\n\n'Twas strange the contrast in the pair,\nThat leant by that cool fountain's side\nBoth very young, both very fair,\nBy nature, not by fate allied:\nThe one a darling and delight,\nA creature like the morning bright:\nWhose weeping is the sunny shower\nHalf light upon an April hour;\nOne who a long glad childhood past,\nBut left that happy home to 'bide\nWhere love a deeper shadow cast,\nA hero's proud and treasured bride:\nWho her light footstep more adored,\nThan all the triumphs of his sword;\nWhose kingdom at her feet the while,\nHad seemed too little for a smile.\nBut that pale slave was as the tomb\nOf her own youth, of her own bloom;\n\nEnough remained to show how fair,\nIn other days those features were,\nStill lingered delicate and fine,\nThe shadow of their pure outline;\nThe small curved lip, the glossy brow,\nThat melancholy beauty wore,\nWhose spell is in the silent past,\nWhich saith to love and hope, 'No more:'\nNo more, for hope hath long forsaken\nLove, though at first its gentle guide\nFirst lulled to sleep, then left to 'waken,\n'Mid tears and scorn, despair and pride,\nAnd only those who know can tell,\nWhat love is after hope's farewell.\nAnd first she spoke of childhood's time,\nLittle, what childhood ought to be,\nWhen tenderly the gentle child\nIs cherished at its mother's knee,\n\nWho deems that ne'er before, from heaven\nSo sweet a thing to earth was given.\nBut she an orphan had no share\nIn fond affection's early care;\nShe knew not love until it came\nFar other, though it bore that name.\n\n'I felt,' she said, 'all things grow bright!\nBefore the spirit's inward light.\nEarth was more lovely, night and day,\nConscious of some enchanted sway,\nThat flung around an atmosphere\nI had not deemed could brighten here.\nAnd I have gazed on Moohreeb's face,\nAs exiles watch their native place;\nI knew his step before it stirred\nFrom its green nest the cautious bird.\n\nI woke, till eye and cheek grew dim,\nThen slept\u2014it was to dream of him;\nI lived for days upon a word\nLess watchful ear had never heard:\nAnd won from careless look or sign\nA happiness too dearly mine.\nHe was my world\u2014I wished to make\nMy heart a temple for his sake.\nIt matters not\u2014such passionate love\nHas only life and hope above;\nA wanderer from its home on high,\nHere it is sent to droop and die.\nHe loved me not\u2014or but a day,\nI was a flower upon his way:\nA moment near his heart enshrined,\nThen flung to perish on the wind.'\n\nShe hid her face within her hands\u2014\nMethinks the maiden well might weep;\nThe heart it has a weary task\nWhich unrequited love must keep;\nAt once a treasure and a curse,\nThe shadow on its universe.\nAlas, for young and wasted years,\nFor long nights only spent in tears;\nFor hopes, like lamps in some dim urn,\nThat but for the departed burn.\nAlas for her whose drooping brow\nScarce struggles with its sorrow now.\nAt first Nadira wept to see\nThat hopelessness of misery.\nBut, oh, she was too glad, too young,\nTo dream of an eternal grief;\nA thousand thoughts within her sprung,\nOf solace, promise, and relief.\n\nSlowly Zilara raised her head,\nThen, moved by some strong feeling, said,\n'A boon, kind Princess, there is one\nWhich won by me, were heaven won;\nNot wealth, not freedom\u2014wealth to me\nIs worthless, as all wealth must be;\nWhen there are none its gifts to share:\nFor whom have I on earth to care?\nNone from whose head its golden shrine\nMay ward the ills that fell on mine.\nAnd freedom\u2014'tis a worthless boon\nTo one who will be free so soon;\nAnd yet I have one prayer, so dear,\nI dare not hope\u2014I only fear.'\n'Speak, trembler, be your wish confest,\nAnd trust Nadira with the rest.'\n'Lady, look forth on yonder tower,\nThere spend I morn and midnight's hour,\n\nBeneath that lonely peepul tree\u2014\nWell may its branches wave o'er me,\nFor their dark wreaths are ever shed,\nThe mournful tribute to the dead\u2014\nThere sit I, in fond wish to cheer\nA captive's sad and lonely ear,\nAnd strive his drooping hopes to raise,\nWith songs that breathe of happier days.\nLady, methinks I scarce need tell\nThe name that I have loved so well;\n'Tis Moohreeb, captured by the sword\nOf him, thy own unconquered lord.\nLady, one word\u2014one look from thee,\nAnd Murad sets that captive free.'\n\n'And you will follow at his side?'\n'Ah, no, he hath another bride;\nAnd if I pity, can'st thou bear\nTo think upon her lone despair?\nNo, break the mountain-chieftain's chain,\nGive him to hope, home, love again.'\nHer cheek with former beauty blushed,\nThe crimson to her forehead rushed,\nHer eyes rekindled, till their light\nFlashed from the lash's summer night.\nSo eager was her prayer, so strong\nThe love that bore her soul along.\nAh! many loves for many hearts;\nBut if mortality has known\nOne which its native heaven imparts\nTo that fine soil where it has grown;\n'Tis in that first and early feeling,\nPassion's most spiritual revealing;\n\nHalf dream, all poetry\u2014whose hope\nColours life's charmed horoscope\nWith hues so beautiful, so pure\u2014\nWhose nature is not to endure.\nAs well expect the tints to last,\nThe rainbow on the storm hath cast.\nOf all young feelings, love first dies,\nSoon the world piles its obsequies;\nYet there have been who still would keep\nThat early vision dear and deep,\nThe wretched they, but love requires\nTears, tears to keep alive his fires:\nThe happy will forget, but those\nTo whom despair denies repose,\nFrom whom all future light is gone,\nThe sad, the slighted, still love on.\n\nThe ghurrees are chiming the morning hour, \nThe voice of the priest is heard from the tower,\nThe turrets of Delhi are white in the sun,\nAlas! that another bright day has begun.\nChildren of earth, ah! how can ye bear\nThis constant awakening to toil and to care?\nOut upon morning, its hours recall,\nEarth to its trouble, man to his thrall;\nOut upon morning, it chases the night,\nWith all the sweet dreams that on slumber alight;\nOut upon morning, which wakes us to life,\nWith its toil, its repining, its sorrow and strife.\nAnd yet there were many in Delhi that day,\nWho watched the first light, and rejoiced in the ray;\n\nThey wait their young monarch, who comes from the field\nWith a wreath on his spear, and a dent on his shield.\nThere's a throng in the east, 'tis the king and his train:\nAnd first prance the horsemen, who scarce can restrain\nTheir steeds that are wild as the wind, and as bold \nAs the riders who curb them with bridles of gold:\nThe elephants follow, and o'er each proud head\nThe chattah that glitters with gems is outspread,\nWhence the silver bells fall with their musical sound,\nWhile the howdah's red trappings float bright on the ground: \nBehind stalk the camels, which, weary and worn,\nSeem to stretch their long necks, and repine at the morn:\nAnd wild on the air the fierce war-echoes come,\nThe voice of the atabal, trumpet, and drum:\n\nHalf lost in the shout that ascends from the crowd,\nWho delight in the young, and the brave, and the proud.\nTis folly to talk of the right and the wrong,\nThe triumph will carry the many along.\nA dearer welcome far remains,\nThan that of Delhi's crowded plains?\nSoon Murad seeks the shadowy hall,\nCool with the fountain's languid fall;\nHis own, his best beloved to meet.\nWhy kneels Nadira at his feet?\nWith flushing cheek, and eager air,\nOne word hath won her easy prayer;\nIt is such happiness to grant,\nThe slightest fancy that can haunt\nThe loved one's wish, earth hath no gem,\nAnd heaven no hope, too dear for them.\nThat night beheld a vessel glide,\nOver the Jumna's onward tide;\n\nOne watched that vessel from the shore,\nToo conscious of the freight it bore,\nAnd wretched in her granted vow,\nSees Moohreeb leaning by the prow,\nAnd knows that soon the winding river\nWill hide him from her view for ever.\n\nNext morn they found that youthful slave\nStill kneeling by the sacred wave;\nHer head was leaning on the stone\nOf an old ruined tomb beside,\nA fitting pillow cold and lone,\nThe dead had to the dead supplied:\nThe heart's last string hath snapt in twain,\nOh, earth, receive thine own again:\nThe weary one at length has rest\nWithin thy chill but quiet breast.\n\nLong did the young Nadira keep\nThe memory of that maiden's lute;\nAnd call to mind her songs, and weep,\nLong after those charmed chords were mute.\nA small white tomb was raised, to show\nThat human sorrow slept below;\nAnd solemn verse and sacred line\nWere graved on that funereal shrine.\nAnd by its side the cypress tree\nStood, like unchanging memory.\nAnd even to this hour are thrown\nGreen wreaths on that remembered stone;\nAnd songs remain, whose tunes are fraught\nWith music which herself first taught.\nAnd, it is said, one lonely star\nStill brings a murmur sweet and far\nUpon the silent midnight air,\nAs if Zilara wandered there.\n\nOh! if her poet soul be blent\nWith its aerial element,\nMay its lone course be where the rill\nGoes singing at its own glad will;\nWhere early flowers unclose and die;\nWhere shells beside the ocean lie,\nFill'd with strange tones; or where the breeze\nSheds odours o'er the moonlit seas:\nThere let her gentle spirit rove,\nEmbalmed by poetry and love."}
