{"subject": "A Meeting", "text": "When all the splendour wanes\nLike a slow sunset from the changeful leaves,\nAnd the grey time of rains\nWith hooded dawns and eves\nApproaches, I shall come to you once more,\nSome afternoon of sun and sunlit cloud\nAnd knocking at your door\nAwait your soft and murmurous tread, scarce heard\nFor sudden pulses loud\nBy long desire and many memories stirred. . .\nSo you will come, and we shall meet again,\nAfter the going-down of many days,\nThe death of many dreams;\nUnder the gracious heavens of your gaze\nMy heart shall lie as some autumnal land\nFulfilled with aureate light and azure haze,\nThe while we speak of themes\nFamiliar, or recall forgotten things\u2014\nTelling of autumn and the fallen flow'rs,\nAnd the fled wings\u2014\nLest love usurp our straitly guarded lips,\nAnd the irrevocable word be said\nThat ends the wordless hours . . .\n\nUnheard, like petals shed\nIn fields of poppy-bloom,\nThe moments fall and turn to memories\nThough Love foresees\nHere, in the sunlit room,\nThe ultimate night and silence of his doom.\nBut not too heavily the burden weighs,\nWhile your sweet gaze\nLingers upon me like a tranquil light,\nAnd all the murmured music of your voice\nBecomes an echo for the songless days.\nAnd heart and soul rejoice,\nKnowing your presence for a little while,\nBut dare not tell\nhow love has made this hour ineffable,\nAnd dare not tell the dearness of your smile."}
