{"subject": "Electrical Content", "text": "Stars storm and startle \u2014\nFlood of electrical flows\nInto granite cisterns \u2014\nThrough the dark a castle glows.\n\nBlack caves breathing gold \u2014\nNo one will gather it fresh.\nSomeone anoints with blue oil\nA thought seeking flesh.\n\nDo not touch the grass, the leaves.\nLightning in each speck of dirt.\nSwim away in silent ether\nTo a second heart, a third.\n\nBirds hover. Strangely falling\nInto an abyss of mood.\nAnd the white goddess Luna\nDances naked in the wood."}
