{"subject": "Sonnet Lii: O Whether", "text": "At the Author's Going into Italy\n\nO whether (poor forsaken) wilt thou go, \nTo go from sorrow and thine own distress, \nWhen every place presents the face of woe, \nAnd no remove can make thy sorrow less? \nYet go (forsaken), leave these woods, these plains; \nLeave her and all, and all for her that leaves \nThee and thy love forlorn, and both disdains, \nAnd of both wrongful deems and ill conceives. \nSeek out some place, and see if any place \nGive give the least release unto thy grief, \nConvey thee from the thought of thy disgrace, \nSteal from thyself, and be thy cares own thief. \nBut yet what comfort shall I hereby gain? \nBearing the wound, I needs must feel the pain."}
