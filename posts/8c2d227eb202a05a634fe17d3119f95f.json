{"subject": "A Picture", "text": "The Sun burns fiercely down the skies;\nThe sea is full of flashing eyes;\nThe waves glide shoreward serpentwise \nAnd fawn with foamy tongues on stark\nGray rocks, each sharp-toothed as a shark,\nAnd hiss in clefts and channels dark. \n\nBlood-purple soon the waters grow,\nAs though drowned sea-kings fought below\nForgotten fights of long ago. \n\nThe gray owl Dusk its wings has spread;\nThe sun sinks in a blossom-bed\nOf poppy-clouds; the day is dead."}
