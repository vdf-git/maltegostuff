{"subject": "A Hot Patch", "text": "All the wayward words\nmock me for inadequacy.\nI remain detached from meaning, \nemigrating to eloquence of wordless solitude.\nThe hymen breaks.\nDumb poems cry. I don\u2019t want to be buried\nin ruins of daydreams.\n\nSandstorms have a strange melancholy, holocaust.\nA legitimate uprooting of faith. \nSometimes I feel a hot patch\nof sun on my face.\nOne moon away was my cool, \nabode in a green painting, \nbut the frost never melted.\nThis darkness is only companion, \nI will talk to winds.\nThe comments on riddles will continue. \nA selection of memories, \nwill make my meditation.\nThe friction in history was shame.\nMay be love will win."}
