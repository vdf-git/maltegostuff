{"subject": "The Siege", "text": "Dual fall of the brass.\nFrom the bine, \nfrom the bliss of flower strength. \nAn apparition \nof infiniteness of agony.\nBecoming one with failures.\n\nIt tends to stay \nand enters the forbidden city \nof endless gods.Me beseeching, imploring \nto remain poor of any treasure.\nThe mysterious pain \na trap cannot catch.\n\nOh, pass on a cloud \nmy eyes want to rain."}
