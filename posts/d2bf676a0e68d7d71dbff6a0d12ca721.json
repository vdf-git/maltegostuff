{"subject": "Ballade Of The Traffickers", "text": "Up goes the price of our bread-- \nUp goes the cost of our caking! \nPeople must ever be fed; \nBakers must ever be baking. \nSo, though our nerves may be quaking, \nDumbly, in arrant despair, \nPay we the crowd that is taking \nAll that the traffic will bear.\n\nCostly to sleep in a bed! \nCostlier yet to be waking! \nCostly for one who is wed! \nRuinous for one who is raking! \nTradespeople, ducking and draking, \nCharge you as much as they dare, \nAsking, without any faking, \nAll that the traffic will bear.\n\nRoof that goes over our head, \nThirst so expensive for slaking, \nPaper, apparel, and lead-- \nWhy are their prices at breaking? \nYet, though our purses be aching, \nLittle the traffickers care; \nGetting, for chopping and steaking, \nAll that the traffic will bear.\n\nL'ENVOI\n\nTake thou my verses, I pray, King, \nLetting my guerdon be fair.\nEven a bard must be making \nAll that the traffic will bear."}
