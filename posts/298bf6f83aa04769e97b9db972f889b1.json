{"subject": "Untimely Lost Oliver Madox Brown Born 1855; Died 1874", "text": "UPON the landscape of his coming life\nA youth high-gifted gazed, and found it fair:\nThe heights of work, the floods of praise, were there.\nWhat friendships, what desires, what love, what wife?\u2014\nAll things to come. The fanned springtime was rife\nWith imminent solstice; and the ardent air\nHad summer sweets and autumn fires to bear;\u2014\nHeart's ease full-pulsed with perfect strength for strife.\nA mist has risen: we see the youth no more:\nDoes he see on and strive on? And may we\nLate-tottering world-worn hence, find his to be\nThe young strong hand which helps us up that shore?\nOr, echoing the No More with Nevermore,\nMust Night be ours and his? We hope: and he?"}
