{"subject": "Sweet Rose Of Virtue", "text": "Sweet rose of virtue and of gentleness,\ndelightful lily of youthful wantonness,\nrichest in bounty and in beauty clear\nand in every virtue that is held most dear\u2015\nexcept only that you are merciless.\n\nInto your garden, today, I followed you;\nthere I saw flowers of freshest hue,\nboth white and red, delightful to see,\nand wholesome herbs, waving resplendently\u2015\nyet nowhere, one leaf or flower of rue.\n\nI fear that March with his last arctic blast\nhas slain my fair rose of pallid and gentle cast,\nwhose piteous death does my heart such pain\nthat, if I could, I would compose her roots again\u2015\nso comforting her bowering leaves have been."}
