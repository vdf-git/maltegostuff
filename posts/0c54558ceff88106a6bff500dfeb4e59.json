{"subject": "Over Greenland", "text": "A current like a noise machine through sleep.\nBlue lichen fields. Mossed boulders. Waking up\nto ice cubes cracking in a plastic cup\n\nand voices (\"awesome for the Hong Kong branch\n. . . well, most of all we miss our daughter . . . \") I still\nsee it: the climb up slate as runnels spill\n\nfrom some bare misted summit like a source.\nWhatever sense this dream might make\nto others. And whatever when they wake\n\nthey also have been dreaming. Rivers of faces\ndown hallways, merging, as desires mesh\nand fissure. Cash for clothes or arms or flesh.\n\nAnd if there is no towering sublime\nwhere all comes clear to all, no final climb\nthrough cloud, like some old Bible illustration:\n\nhow could that ever stop the current flowing\nout of the glass at JFK: skin glowing\nplumb and peach as we walk inside the sun."}
