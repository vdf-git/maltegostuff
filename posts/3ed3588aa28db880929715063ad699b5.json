{"subject": "Ode To Fortune", "text": "Thy favours, Fortune, I ne'er court,\nNor with thy vot'ries much resort;\nBut, didst thou bid me chuse a state,\nNot meanly poor, nor prineely great,\nPlace me far from the sound of war,\nAnd all the wranglings of the bar;\nYet nearer to the village spire,\nThan to his lordship, or the 'squire.\nThree miles from town, be my retreat,\nA pleasant cottage, small, but neat,\nThat, to the stranger wand'ring near,\nWou'd seem to say, content dwells here.\nLet gadding woodbines round it creep,\nAnd in each lattice fondly peep;\nA garden, too, its front adorn,\nHedg'd careless round; beneath a thorn,\nA shade, wherein to muse at ease,\nAnd watch the labours of my bees;\nOr study o'er each golden rule,\nOf those well known in wisdom's school;\nOr here, when eve bids labour rest,\nPipe, to delight some village guest.\n\nNo artful walks I'd wish to view,\nFor nature ne'er to art shou'd bow;\nBut when the rival pair unite,\nWhere is the breast they can't delight?\nThus be the front. And now behind,\nA wood shou'd check the wild north wind;\nAnd shelter safe a warbling throng,\nWhose rent shou'd be a chearful song.\nWhat joy to hear my tenants, free,\nHymn grateful notes, from tree to tree!\nNo sportsman rude (ah! cruel joy!)\nShou'd e'er the harmless race destroy;\nNor truant school--boy e'er shou'd tear\nFrom them the young and tender care:\nThen, oh! mid' Winter's dreary reign,\nWou'd they to visit me but deign,\nI to their wants wou'd still attend,\nProud to become each creature's friend.\n\nNext, give me, for a maid or wife,\nA nut--brown girl, sworn foe to strife;\nOne simple in her dress and air,\nUnus'd to town, or costly fare:\nWho'd cleanly cook my humble meal,\nNor blab the secrets I'd reveal;\nWho'd sing without conceit or pain;\nWho'd read the news and bible plain;\nWho'd write her thoughts in easy prose,\nAnd argue well in virtue's cause.\n\nMy wishes, Fortune, would'st thou crown,\nThe sweets of friendship let me own:\nOne friend I'd ask, of soul sincere,\nNot moving in too high a sphere;\nWho'd bend to no proud party knave;\nA foe to none, to none a slave;\nWho'd scorn by trifles to be bought,\nContent in honest home--spun coat.\nWhen Winter reign'd in furious rage,\nWe'd mark the follies of the age:\nThus converse wou'd each mind illume,\nFor friendship cheers wild Winter's gloom.\nIn Summer, nature's laws we'd scan,\nAdmiring still her beauteous plan;\nAnd oft, by some hoarse--murm'ring stream,\nIndulge a fond poetic dream;\nOr range, with health, the daisied mead,\nThen wou'd this life be life indeed!\n\nThus, Fortune, seated to my mind,\nI'd thank thee oft, and own thee kind.\nSecure from folly's tiresome noise,\nWhere pleasure health and wealth destroys,\nShou'd care or spleen a visit pay,\nI'd bid them call another day;\nAnd chearfully survey the past,\nNor think time mov'd too slow or fast;\nNor wish to live, nor fear to die,\nBut sink to earth, without a sigh.\n\nWith such a friend, a wife, and cot,\nWho wou'd repine, deserves them not;\nAnd he who vainly wishes more,\nMay he, like me, thro' life be poor!"}
