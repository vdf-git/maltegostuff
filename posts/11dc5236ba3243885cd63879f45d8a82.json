{"subject": "Lines To A Reviewer", "text": "Alas, good friend, what profit can you see\nIn hating such a hateless thing as me?\nThere is no sport in hate where all the rage\nIs on one side: in vain would you assuage\nYour frowns upon an unresisting smile,\nIn which not even contempt lurks to beguile\nYour heart, by some faint sympathy of hate.\nOh, conquer what you cannot satiate!\nFor to your passion I am far more coy\nThan ever yet was coldest maid or boy\nIn winter noon. Of your antipathy\nIf I am the Narcissus, you are free\nTo pine into a sound with hating me."}
