{"subject": "1915", "text": "I\u2019ve watched the Seasons passing slow, so slow, \nIn the fields between La Bass\u00e9e and Bethune; \nPrimroses and the first warm day of Spring, \nRed poppy floods of June, \nAugust, and yellowing Autumn, so \nTo Winter nights knee-deep in mud or snow, \nAnd you\u2019ve been everything. \n\nDear, you\u2019ve been everything that I most lack \nIn these soul-deadening trenches\u2014pictures, books, \nMusic, the quiet of an English wood, \nBeautiful comrade-looks, \nThe narrow, bouldered mountain-track, \nThe broad, full-bosomed ocean, green and black, \nAnd Peace, and all that\u2019s good."}
