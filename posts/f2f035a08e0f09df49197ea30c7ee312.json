{"subject": "Gehazi", "text": "1915\nWhence comest thou, Gehazi,\nSo reverend to behold,\nIn scarlet and in ermines\nAnd chain of England's gold?\"\n\n\"From following after Naaman\nTo tell him all is well,\nWhereby my zeal hath made me\nA Judge in Israel.\"\n\nWell done; well done, Gehazi!\nStretch forth thy ready hand,\nThou barely 'scaped from judgment,\nTake oath to judge the land\nUnswayed by gift of money\nOr privy bribe, more base,\nOf knowledge which is profit\nIn any market-place.\n\nSearch out and probe, Gehazi,\nAs thou of all carist try,\nThe truthful, well-weighed answer\nThat tells the blacker lie --\nThe loud, uneasy virtue\nThe anger feigned at will,\nTo overbear a witness\nAnd make the Court keep still.\n\nTake order now, Gehazi,\nThat no man talk aside\nIn secret with his judges\nThe while his case is tried.\nLest he should show them -- reason\nTo keep a matter hid,\nAnd subtly lead the questions\nAway from what he did.\n\nThou mirror of uprightness,\nWhat ails thee at thy vows?\nWhat means the risen whiteness\nOf the skin between thy brows?\n\nThe boils that shine and burrow,\nThe sores that slough and bleed --\nThe leprosy of Naaman\nOn thee and all thy seed?\nStand up, stand up, Gehazi,\nDraw close thy robe and go,\nGehazi, Judge in Israel,\nA leper white as snow!"}
