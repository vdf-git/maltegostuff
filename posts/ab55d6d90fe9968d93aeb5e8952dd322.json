{"subject": "Stilling The Waves", "text": "Written in her thirteenth year \n\n'And he arose and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea,'Peace, be still!'' \nBe still, ye waves, for Christ doth deign to tread \nOn the rough bosom of your watery bed! \nBe not too harsh your gracious Lord to greet, \nBut, in soft murmurs, kiss his holy feet; \n'T is He alone can calm your rage at will, \nThis is His sacred mandate, 'Peace, be still!'"}
