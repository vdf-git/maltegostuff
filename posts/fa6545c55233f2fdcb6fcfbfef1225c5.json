{"subject": "In Soft Tone", "text": "A quiet day surrounds me \nand within me life faints. \nI feel close the fear of creatures\nand am alone in my own peace.\nIs there not in me the attention \nof verses and their quiet performance\nwoven into this small poem made of\nsome happiness and light sorrow? \n\nThat you were near me once again\nand I found you cool and pure\nand understood in sadness \nthe distance between you and I."}
