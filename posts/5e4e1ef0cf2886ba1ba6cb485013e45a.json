{"subject": "Oh, Why Was He Taken?", "text": "Dedicated To Mrs. H. Scott Howell, of Keokuk, Iowa.\nOh, why was he taken in Life's early morning, \nYour only \u2015your darling \u2015your beautiful boy ? \nWhy torn from your arms without whisper or warning, \nThe babe that you counted a ' well-spring of joy'? \nDid you love him too much? Had the future been gilded \nWith pictures too golden \u2015with dreams all too bright ? \nAnd was it for this all the hopes you had builded \nWere shattered and crushed by Death's withering blight? \n\nWhat is home to you now, since your hearthstone may never \nBe gladdened again by that innocent face,\u2015\nSince the light of his presence has vanished forever, \nAnd no sign of the soft, dimpled hands you may trace? \nAs you sit by his crib, with his playthings beside you, \nHis rattle and ring and each worn, broken toy, \nYour empty hearts reach for the treasure denied you, \nAnd your lips wait in vain for the kiss of your boy. \n\nAnd you wonder, so often, if this folded blossom \nIn Eden's own light will unopened remain ; \nWhen your bud is reclaimed, will you clasp to your bosom \nYour baby \u2015the dear, angel-baby\u2015 again? \nWill it rest on His breast, 'as a child,' till your coming, \nIn His sheltering arms Who bade children to come ? \n'Oh, yes !' Faith replies, as you look through the gloaming: \n'Not lost \u2015only waiting with Jesus\u2015 at Home.'"}
