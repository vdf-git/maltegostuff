{"subject": "SOME LOVE POEMS", "text": "1\n\nThere you go\nthis morning\nwith frost\nin your parka\ndown London Road\n\nI'd know your walk\nanywhere\n\nBut I'm not there\nI'm in this dumb room\nwith your blond hair\n&amp; all the beautiful lines\non your very special face\n\n2\n\nIn your doorway\nI'll stay\n\nthe light kisses\nI'll place\n&amp; there are diamonds\non your eyelids\n\nI'll stay here\nin your doorway\n&amp; when we kiss\nwe both look so young\n\n3\n\nYour bathroom is alone\nthe spotless white bath\nyour brushes &amp; stuff\n\nI'd stand here often\nin my own silence\nbut your bathroom is alone now\n&amp; I don't wait\n\nI don't walk\ndown to the table and ashtray\njust to remind you again\nhow much you will always move me\n\n4\n\nIt's only your voice \n&amp; frost on the wires\n\nIt's only the touch\nof your hair\n\nonly the sunlight\nthrough your white blinds\n\nIt's only your presence\non all the platforms &amp; rain\n\nin all the aisles\nin the glasses &amp; bottles\n\nin the air\nin the wayward stars\n\nin all the leaves\nin our unhappy faces"}
