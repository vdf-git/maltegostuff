{"subject": "The Knightly Guerdon", "text": "Untrue to my Ulric I never could be,\nI vow by the saints and the blessed Marie,\nSince the desolate hour when we stood by the shore,\nAnd your dark galley waited to carry you o'er:\nMy faith then I plighted, my love I confess'd,\nAs I gave you the BATTLE-AXE marked with your crest!\n\nWhen the bold barons met in my father's old hall,\nWas not Edith the flower of the banquet and ball?\nIn the festival hour, on the lips of your bride,\nWas there ever a smile save with THEE at my side?\nAlone in my turret I loved to sit best,\nTo blazon your BANNER and broider your crest.\n\nThe knights were assembled, the tourney was gay!\nSir Ulric rode first in the warrior-melee.\nIn the dire battle-hour, when the tourney was done,\nAnd you gave to another the wreath you had won!\nThough I never reproached thee, cold, cold was my breast,\nAs I thought of that BATTLE-AXE, ah! and that crest!\n\nBut away with remembrance, no more will I pine\nThat others usurped for a time what was mine!\nThere's a FESTIVAL HOUR for my Ulric and me:\nOnce more, as of old, shall he bend at my knee;\nOnce more by the side of the knight I love best\nShall I blazon his BANNER and broider his crest."}
