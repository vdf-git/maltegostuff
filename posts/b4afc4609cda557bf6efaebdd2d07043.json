{"subject": "Shine, Perishing Republic", "text": "While this America settles in the mould of its vulgarity, heavily thickening    \n    to empire\nAnd protest, only a bubble in the molten mass, pops and sighs out, and the\n    mass hardens,\nI sadly smiling remember that the flower fades to make fruit, the fruit rots \n    to make earth.\nOut of the mother; and through the spring exultances, ripeness and deca-\n    dence; and home to the mother.\n\nYou making haste haste on decay: not blameworthy; life is good, be it stub-\n    bornly long or suddenly\nA mortal splendor: meteors are not needed less than mountains: \n    shine, perishing republic.\nBut for my children, I would have them keep their distance from the thick-\n    ening center; corruption\nNever has been compulsory, when the cities lie at the monster's feet there \n    are left the mountains.\nAnd boys, be in nothing so moderate as in love of man, a clever servant, \n    insufferable master.\nThere is the trap that catches noblest spirits, that caught--they say--\n    God, when he walked on earth."}
