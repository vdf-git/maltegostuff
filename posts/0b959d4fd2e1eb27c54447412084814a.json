{"subject": "To A Cold Beauty", "text": "Lady, wouldst thou heiress be \nTo Winters cold and cruel part? \nWhen he sets the rivers free, \nThou dost still lock up thy heart;\u2014 \nThou that shouldst outlast the snow, \nBut in the whiteness of thy brow? \nScorn and cold neglect are made \nFor winter gloom and winter wind, \nBut thou wilt wrong the summer air, \nBreathing it to words unkind,\u2014 \nBreath which only should belong \nTo love, to sunlight, and to song! \nWhen the little buds unclose. \nRed, and white, and pied, and blue, \nAnd that virgin flow'r, the rose, \nOpes her heart to hold the dew, \nWilt thou lock thy bosom up \nWith no jewel in its cup? \nLet not cold December sit \nThus in Love's peculiar throne: \nBrooklets are not prison'd now, \nBut crystal frosts are all agone, \nAnd that which hangs upon the spray, \nIt is no snow, but flow'r of May!"}
