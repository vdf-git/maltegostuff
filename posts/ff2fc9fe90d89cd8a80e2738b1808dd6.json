{"subject": "Messengers Of Dreams", "text": "My heart can tell them, every one, \nThe messengers of dreams that run \nAbove the tree-tops in the sun. \n\nWhether of great or little worth \nThey carry the heart s desires forth \nEast and west and south and north. \n\nI know the night will close them in ---\nAnd they will meet the tempest s din ---\nEre they come to that far-off inn. \n\nThe inn that stands on the bourne of hope, \nWhere Fear and Delight together cope \nFor victory on a little slope. \n\nMy heart can tell them, every one, \nThe returning messengers that run \nAbove the tree-tops in the sun."}
