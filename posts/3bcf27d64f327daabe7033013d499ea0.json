{"subject": "The Windows", "text": "Lord, how can man preach thy eternall word?\nHe is a brittle crazie glasse:\nYet in thy temple thou dost him afford\nThis glorious and transcendent place,\nTo be a window, through thy grace.\n\nBut when thou dost anneal in glasse thy storie,\nMaking thy life to shine within\nThe holy Preachers ; then the light and glorie\nMore rev'rend grows, &amp; more doth win:\nWhich else shows watrish, bleak, &amp; thin.\n\nDoctrine and life, colours and light, in one\nWhen they combine and mingle, bring\nA strong regard and aw : but speech alone\nDoth vanish like a flaring thing,\nAnd in the eare, not conscience ring."}
