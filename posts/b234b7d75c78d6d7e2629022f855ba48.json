{"subject": "Poppies", "text": "These are the flowers of sleep\nThat nod in the heavy noon,\nEre the brown shades eastward creep\nTo a drowsy and dreamful tune,\nThese are the flowers of sleep.\n\nLove's lilies are passion-pale,\nBut these on the sun-kissed flood\nOf the corn, that rolls breast deep,\nBurn redder than drops of blood\nOn a dead king's golden mail.\n\nHeart's dearest, I would that we\nThese blooms of forgetfulness\nMight bind on our brows, and steep\nOur love in Lethe ere less\nGrow its flame with thee or me.\n\nWhen Time with his evil eye\nThe beautiful Love has slain,\nThere is nought to gain or keep\nThereafter, and all is vain.\nShould we wait to see Love die?\n\nSweetheart, of the joys men reap\nWe have reaped; 'tis time to rest.\nWhy should we wake but to weep?\nSleep and forgetting is best,\nThese are the flowers of sleep."}
