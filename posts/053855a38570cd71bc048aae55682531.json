{"subject": "To His Friend Master R. L., In Praise Of Music And Poetry", "text": "If music and sweet poetry agree,\nAs they must needs (the sister and the brother),\nThen must the love be great 'twixt thee and me,\nBecause thou lov'st the one, and I the other.\nDowland to thee is dear, whose heavenly touch\nUpon the lute doth ravish human sense;\nSpenser to me, whose deep conceit is such\nAs, passing all conceit, needs no defence.\nThou lov'st to hear the sweet melodious sound\nThat Ph\u0153bus' lute (the queen of music makes;\nAnd I in deep delight am chiefly drown'd\nWhenas himself to singing he betakes.\nOne god is god of both (as poets feign),\nOne knight loves both, and both in thee remain."}
