{"subject": "Mors Et Vita", "text": "\u201cUNDER the roots of the roses,\nDown in the dark, rich mould,\nThe dust of my dear one reposes\nLike a spark which night incloses\nWhen the ashes of day are cold.\u201d \n\n\u201cUnder the awful wings\nWhich brood over land and sea,\nAnd whose shadows nor lift nor flee,\u2014\nThis is the order of things,\nAnd hath been from of old: \nFirst production,\nAnd last destruction;\nSo the pendulum swings,\nWhile cradles are rocked and bells are tolled.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot under the roots of the roses, \nBut under the luminous wings\nOf the King of kings\nThe soul of my love reposes,\nWith the light of morn in her eyes,\nWhere the Vision of Life discloses \nLife that sleeps not nor dies.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnder or over the skies\nWhat is it that never dies?\nSpirit\u2014if such there be\u2014\nWhom no one hath seen nor heard, \nWe do not acknowledge thee;\nFor, spoken or written word,\nThou art but a dream, a breath;\nCertain is nothing but Death!\u201d"}
