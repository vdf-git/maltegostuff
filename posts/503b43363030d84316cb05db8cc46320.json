{"subject": "An August Night", "text": "Hot with the ardour of the sun,\nWhose burning lips had slain the noon,\nThe golden pallor of the moon\nWas but an added fire, o'ercome\nWith memories she swooned away,\nWhile I, grown weary with the day\nSought on my balcony to find\nSome solace for my groping mind,\nBut lo ! the awful night was fraught\nWith anguish, from the noontide caught;\nThe dark was breathless, and the skies\nFilled with a thousand prying eyes\nBut scoffed to see my soul's despair,\nAnd flung me back my tortured prayer."}
