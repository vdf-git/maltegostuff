{"subject": "I missed my moment", "text": "And how could I fail to miss it, reading tomorrow's news\non the internet, hearing songs by the white dwarves\nof rock pretending to be supernovas. Seeing\n\nhow a tsunami from years ago keeps on engulfing\nthe same old villages, and the World Trade Center towers\nare hurriedly rebuilt by night in order languidly\n\nto tumble by day. So tell me, how could I not miss\nmy moment in a world where the same paper\ncomes out in four versions: conservative,\n\nprogressive, moderate and without text. In times\nwhen the unused minutes pass on to the next\nmonth. I missed my moment. When, where?\n\nOr maybe it missed me? Vanished\nover the horizon, fattened infinitely.\n\nAnd is waiting.\n\nTranslated by Antonia Lloyd-Jones"}
