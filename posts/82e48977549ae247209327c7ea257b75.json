{"subject": "Sonnet Ccciv: Thy Birthday Opened With Artillery;--", "text": "Thy birthday opened with artillery;-- \nThe flash and thunder of the breaking wave, \nAt early dawn, a greeting salvo gave, \nWhile roared the outer crowded, jostling sea. \nGlad heaven displayed its sunrise pageantry, \nEach cloud the other trying to outbrave, \nTill Phoebus through them drove his fiery nave, \nIn golden tnumph--all to honor thee! \nO sea, we love thee! By thy moonlit side, \nMingling my halting whisper with thy tone, \nI spoke the words that made her heart my own; \nAnd ever since, the murmuring of thy tide, \nUplifting to the moon its silver zone, \nBrings back the night whose memory is our pride."}
