{"subject": "It Follows", "text": "If you had a lot of money\n(by some coincidence\nyou\u2019re at the Nassau Inn in Princeton\ngetting a whiff of class)\nand you just noticed two days ago\nthat your face has fallen,\nbut you don\u2019t believe it,\nso every time you look in the glass\nit\u2019s still hanging there where it wasn\u2019t.\nWould you take the money you needed\nfor a new roof on your old house\n(the house you\u2019re paying for\nover and over in property taxes)\nbecause it\u2019s been leaking for years\nand you\u2019re tired of emptying buckets\nand spraying for mold,\nwould you take that money\nand get your face lifted?\nFace-lift. They cut a slit\nunder your ears and pull up the slack\nand they tack it with plastic.\nThen they pull up the outer\nskin and trim it because it\u2019s too long and\nfasten that. (Your skin\npulls loose from the fat like chicken skin.)\nBecause once you were almost\nas beautiful as Jane Wyman ...\nyour friends all said that.\nOf course at the time she was\nmarried to Ronnie and you were\ninvolved with the ASU\u2014\na McCarthy suspect.\nForget about your neck.\nThey can\u2019t do that yet.\nA face-lift lasts five years.\nSo you could go on being a member\nof new-speak and re-entry\u2014\nwith the unsung benefits\nof radiation and by then\nyour roof would have rotted anyway.\nOr been recycled by some corporate kid.\nBut think how you\u2019d rather\nbe stripped and streaked\nand while you\u2019re about it\nget some implants of baby teeth buds\nthat they\u2019ve taken from dead babies\u2019 gums\nand frozen for this sort of thing.\nYou could still die young."}
