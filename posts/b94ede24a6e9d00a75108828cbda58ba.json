{"subject": "All Winged Creatures I Have Loved", "text": "All the winged creatures I have loved!\nAnd when, a child, I 'neath the thicket roved,\nI from their nests the little birds conveyed\u2014\nAt first, of reeds I cages for them made,\nWhere, mid green mosses, I to tame them tried.\nLater, I used to leave the windows wide:\nThey flew not off, or if the woods their choice,\nStill they returned whene'er they heard my voice.\nA dove and I long lived in friendliness!\nNow I the art of taming souls possess."}
