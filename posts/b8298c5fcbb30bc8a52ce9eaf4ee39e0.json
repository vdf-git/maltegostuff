{"subject": "The Tower Of Famine", "text": "Amid the desolation of a city,\nWhich was the cradle, and is now the grave\nOf an extinguished people,\u2014so that Pity\n\nWeeps o\u2019er the shipwrecks of Oblivion\u2019s wave,\nThere stands the Tower of Famine. It is built\nUpon some prison-homes, whose dwellers rave\n\nFor bread, and gold, and blood: Pain, linked to Guilt,\nAgitates the light flame of their hours,\nUntil its vital oil is spent or spilt.\n\nThere stands the pile, a tower amid the towers \nAnd sacred domes; each marble-ribbed roof,\nThe brazen-gated temples, and the bowers\n\nOf solitary wealth,--the tempest-proof\nPavilions of the dark Italian air,--\nAre by its presence dimmed--they stand aloof, \n\nAnd are withdrawn\u2014so that the world is bare;\nAs if a spectre wrapped in shapeless terror\nAmid a company of ladies fair\n\nShould glide and glow, till it became a mirror\nOf all their beauty, and their hair and hue,\nThe life of their sweet eyes, with all its error,\nShould be absorbed, till they to marble grew."}
