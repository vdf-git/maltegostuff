{"subject": "Nettles", "text": "My son aged three fell in the nettle bed.\n'Bed' seemed a curious name for those green spears,\nThat regiment of spite behind the shed:\nIt was no place for rest. With sobs and tears\nThe boy came seeking comfort and I saw\nWhite blisters beaded on his tender skin.\nWe soothed him till his pain was not so raw.\nAt last he offered us a watery grin,\nAnd then I took my billhook, honed the blade\nAnd went outside and slashed in fury with it\nTill not a nettle in that fierce parade\nStood upright any more. And then I lit\nA funeral pyre to burn the fallen dead,\nBut in two weeks the busy sun and rain\nHad called up tall recruits behind the shed:\nMy son would often feel sharp wounds again."}
