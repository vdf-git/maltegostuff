{"subject": "To My Sister - With An Ivy Wreath On Her Birth-Day", "text": "Another year hath roll'd away ;\nSummer gives place to Autumn's gloom,\nAnd lengthen'd night and shorten'd day\nProclaim my sister's birthday come.\n\nThen, Martha, while thine hand receives\nThe wreaths that mine for thee hath twin'd,\nRead in their dark-green shining leaves\nA useful lesson to thy mind.\n\nVirtue, like them, is ever green,\nLike them, fresh graces can impart,\nEnlivening the gloomiest scene,\nAnd lightening the heaviest heart.\n\nThat ivy deck'd its parent tree,\nOn whose young bosom it was born ;\nAnd so shall virtue be to thee,\nGracing thy life's fair opening morn.\n\nIn later times it still shall twine,\nEncircling its native stem ;\nIt shall support thy life's decline, -\nIts leaves thy emerald diadem.\n\n'Twill guide thee in the way of love,\n'Twill grace thee when those locks are snow ;\nAnd in the blessed realms above,\n'Twill be the crown to bind thy brow."}
