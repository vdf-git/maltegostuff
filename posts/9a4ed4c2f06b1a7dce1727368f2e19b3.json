{"subject": "Sunday Chimes In The City", "text": "Across the bridge, where in the morning blow \nThe wrinkled tide turns homeward, and is fain \nHomeward to drag the balck sea-goer's chain, \nAnd the long yards by Dowgate dipping low; \nAcross dispeopled ways, patient and slow, \nSaint Magnus and Saint Dunstan call in vain: \n&gt;From Wren's forgotten belfries, in the rain, \nDown the blank wharves the dropping octaves go.\n\nForbid not these! Tho' no man heed, they shower \nA subtle beauty on the empty hour, \n&gt;From all their dark throats aching and outblown; \nAye in the prayerless places welcome most, \nLike the last gull that up a naked coast \nDeploys her white and steady wing, alone."}
