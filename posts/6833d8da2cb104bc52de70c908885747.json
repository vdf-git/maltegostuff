{"subject": "Poem 94", "text": "NAthlesse the cruell boy not so content,\nwould needs the fly pursue:\nAnd in his hand with heedlesse hardiment,\nhim caught for to subdue.\nBut when on it he hasty hand did lay,\nthe Bee him stung therefore:\nNow out alasse (he cryde) and welaway,\nI wounded am full sore:\nThe fly that I so much did scorne,\nhath hurt me with his little horne."}
