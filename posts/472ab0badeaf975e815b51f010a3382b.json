{"subject": "Iowa's Centennial Poem", "text": "A hundred years ago to-day \nA barren wild our borders lay; \nOur stately forests grandly stood \nWrapped in majestic solitude. \nOur rivers, coursing to the sea, \nFelt not the chain of tyranny; \nNor yet above their glittering sheen \nCould Freedom's stripes and stars be seen. \n\nThe red man. moored his birch canoe \nWhere sweet wild-flowers luxuriant grew; \nWhere sumachs, o'er the pebbly brink, \nBent down their crimson lips to drink; \nAnd violets, with their tender eyes, \nLooked up in wondering surprise \nAt Indian maid, who, by the wave, \nWaited to greet her warrior brave. \n\nA hundred years ! Gone like a dream, \nAll, save our t woods and noble stream; \nThe red man, with his bended bow, \nNo longer fells the bounding doe. \nThe camp-fire's curling smoke no more \nIs seen beside the chieftain's door, \nAs Black Hawk talks, in whispers grave, \nTo Gitchie Manito the Brave. \nBut on this broad, luxuriant plain \nWave golden fields of ripening grain; \nOur pastures, with their gurgling rills, \nFeed cattle on a thousand hills, \nWhile giant steamers plow our streams, \nFrom which our starry banner gleams. \nThe mansions on our prairies wide, \nOft with a rude cot by their side, \nShow how, by years of patient toil, \nThe lordly tillers of our soil \nHave reared such homes as freemen may \nWith all their shackles torn away. \n\nThe flying shuttle, whirling wheel, \nInvention's mighty power reveal. \nWe sweep, by steam, o'er earth's broad track, \nAnd lightning sends our whispers back. \nWe share the nation's glory, too, \nBy holding to the world's broad view \nOur men of mark, of genius rare, \nScattered, like sunbeams, everywhere. \nOn history's page will shine most bright \nSuch names as Belknap, Kirkwood, Wright, \nHowell, McCreary, Mason, Hall, \nDodge, faithful to his country's call, \nAnd warriors who, through war's wild shock, \nAnchored our ship on Union rock. \n\nThe call that rose at Lexington, \nThere Freedom's struggle was begun, \nReached not these shores, yet still we claim \nThis priceless heritage the same. \nThey were our ancestors who fought \nWhen liberty with blood was bought. \nAnd Concord, with her patriot band, \nWhose sons to-day rejoicing stand, \nDeserves no more the honors won \nThan we, so near the setting sun. \n\nCould our hearts bound with wilder thrill \nIf we had met on Bunker's Hill? \nAre patriots truer on the sod \nWhence those br^ave souls went up to God? \nNot if, with loyal heart and hand,. \nWe held the heritage they planned; \nNot if, along this verdant track, \nWhen Dissolution's cloud hung black, \nOur soldiers poured their blood like rain,\u2014 \nDeluged our sod with crimson stain,\u2014\nAnd flung our starry banner out \nWith glad, prolonged victorious shout, \nProclaiming where its bright folds waved \nOur fathers' boon\u2014the Union\u2014saved. \nYes, side by side with those who sped \nWhere'er the gallant Putnam led, \nWith those whose forms grew cold and still \nUpon the brow of Bunker's Hill, \nWe proudly write, on History's page, \nThe heroes of the present age; \nOur dauntless braves, who did not quail \nBeneath the storm of iron hail, \nBut who, like valiant Warren, fell \nGuarding the land they loved so well. \n\nMills, Baker, Torrence, Worthington, \nMartyrs to Freedom dearly won, \nBeside their tombs our patriots cry, \n'As much of valor as could die!' \nAsk ye if Woman shrinking stood, \nWhen rang War's cry o'er field and flood? \nDid mothers, racked by dire alarms, \nPrison their sons with clinging arms? \nNo ; worthy of the patriot sires \nThat lit the Revolution fires, \nThey forced the tears, that needs must start. \nBackward, to trickle through the heart, \nAnd said, in accents firm and low, \n' Our prayers will follow, \u2014go, boys, go!' \n\nSo when ye boast, as boast ye will, \nOf the green slopes of Bunker's Hill, \nAnd vow that ne'er shall be forgot \nHow Shiloh and Pea Ridge were fought; \nWhen, with fond pride, you teach your son \nHow Tuttle's men took Donelson; \nWhen to Alltoona you refer, \nAnd tell how Corse defended her; \nOr when you link with Archer's name \nThe sword his son will proudly claim, \nForget not Woman, who, through tears, \nRead how the form that other years \nHad seen soft-pillowed on her breast,\u2014 \nThe lips her own* so fondly pressed \nHad murmured forth their dying moan\u2014 \nHad paled and chilled, unsoothed \u2014alone,\u2014\nRemember, every gallant one \nWho fell was some fond mother's son. \n\nI stood beneath our State's proud dome, \nAnd saw the dear old Flag* come home. \nWeary and worn and well-nigh spent, \nTo you, O statesmen ! it was sent, \nTo hold as a more priceless gem \nThan England's royal diadem. \nOn shattered staff the wounded bars \nHeld feebly up the golden stars, \nWhile the scarred veteran seemed to say, \n'E'en death is sweet in Iowa.' \n\nI fancied, as they bore it by, \nIts red stripes glowed with deeper dye, \nSince it had cheered each patriot one \nWhose life-blood crimsoned Donelson. \nPurer its lines of spotless white \nSince trusting mothers knelt at night, \nLifting their yearning souls above \nOn the white wings of Faith and Love, \nPleading His arm might be the stay \nOf valiant hearts from Iowa. \n\nDeeper its blue since dimming eyes \nHad faintly smiled in sweet surprise \nUpon the silken folds that spread \nTheir pitying shadows o'er the dead,\u2014\nThe loyal dead, for whom 'twas meet \nTheir Flag should be their winding-sheet. \n\nBrighter its stars of deathless sheen \nSince it had waved o'er fields of green, \nFloated where giant steamers sailed, \nSwayed \u2014trembled \u2014reeled\u2014 yet never trailed. \n\nWell may we celebrate this day \nWith glad, triumphant shout; \nWell may we bid dull care 'Away,' \nAnd fling our banners out. \nE'en Nature joins the welcome sounds \nBy grateful hearts begun, \nTill from our rocks and vales rebounds \nThe name of Washington. \n\nEngland her Wellington may claim; \nFrance of Napoleon boast; \nScotia extol the deathless fame \nOf Wallace and his host; \nBut more ecstatic is the thrill \nThat fires Columbia's son, \nWhen lip and voice grow strangely still \nAt thought of Washington. \n\nPerchance e'en now the shades of those \nWho first in battle led \nHave left their Eden of repose \nTo hover o'er our head. \nThey were the sowers of the seed \nThat made our country free, \nAnd we, the reapers, loud indeed \nMay shout forth ' Victory !' \n\nNor to the arm of flesh alone \nAttribute our success; \nBut to the One who led us on\u2014\nThe God who deigned to bless. \nAnd while, to-day, our banners wave \nFor battles dearly won, \nWe bless the power that victory gave \nTo our own Washington. \n\nBought with the life-blood of the brave, \nHeld through dissension's shock, \nThe heritage our fathers gave \nStands firm on Freedom's rock. \nThen send your welcomes near and far, \nLet party discord cease; \nAnd learn of him who, first in War, \nWas first alike in Peace. \n\nYes, patriot brothers, awaken! \nLeave the red field of carnage behind; \nBe former contentions forsaken, \nAnd thus prove all brave hearts are kind. \nWould ye make this, our glorious Centennial, \nA type of the Union above? \nThen join in our earthly millennial, \nAnd crown it with brotherly love. \n\nOh, be not by prejudice blinded! \nOur wanderers had something to learn; \nAnd by parable all are reminded \nThat e'en prodigal sons may return. \nThen let generous welcomes be proffered; \nGive them robes of a right royal hue; \nLet the rings that restore them be offered \nBy victors who honor the Blue. \n\nThey have desolate hearthstones among them, \nAnd hearts that still moan in their pain, \nWhen the thought of the anguish that wrung them \nFloats over remembrance again. \nThen when come your tear-drops, upstarting, \nFor friends who passed over the tide, \nForget not that many a parting \nBrought woe on the Southern side.\n\nIn the names of our patriots ascended; \nIn the names of our heroes who bled; . \nBy the cause they so nobly defended; \nBy the Rachels who moaned o'er our dead; \nWe ask you to pledge them, true-hearted, \nA covenant-promise anew; \nRemembering 'mong patriots departed \nNo line parts the Gray from the Blue."}
