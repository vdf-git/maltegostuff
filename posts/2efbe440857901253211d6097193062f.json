{"subject": "The Poet\u2019s Euthanasia -", "text": "November: 1674\n\nCloked in gray threadbare poverty, and blind,\nAge-weak, and desolate, and beloved of God;\nHigh-heartedness to long repulse resign'd,\nYet bating not one jot of hope, he trod\nThe sunless skyless streets he could not see;\nBy those faint feet made sacrosanct to me.\n\nYet on that laureate brow the sign he wore\nOf Phoebus' wrath; who,--for his favourite child,\nWhen war and faction raised their rancorous roar,\nLeagued with fanatic frenzy, blood-defiled,\nTo the sweet Muses and himself untrue,--\nAround the head he loved thick darkness threw.\n\n--He goes:--But with him glides the Pleiad throng\nOf that imperial line, whom Phoebus owns\nHis ownest: for, since his, no later song\nHas soar'd, as wide-wing'd, to the diadem'd thrones\nThat, in their inmost heaven, the Muses high\nSet for the sons of immortality.\n\nMost loved, most lovely, near him as he went,\nVergil: and He, supremest for all time,\nIn hoary blindness:--But the sweet lament\nOf Lesbian love, the Parian song sublime,\nFollow'd:--and that stern Florentine apart\nCowl'd himself dark in thought, within his heart\n\nNursing the dream of Church and Caesar's State,\nEmpire and Faith:--while Fancy's favourite child,\nThe myriad-minded, moving up sedate\nBeckon'd his countryman, and inly smiled:--\nThen that august Theophany paled from view,\nTo higher stars drawn up, and kingdoms new."}
