{"subject": "Sonnet Lv.", "text": "BORNE on the warm wing of the western gale,\nHow tremulously low is heard to float\nThro' the green budding thorns that fringe the vale\nThe early Nightingale's prelusive note.\n'Tis Hope's instinctive power that through the grove\nTells how benignant Heaven revives the earth;\n'Tis the soft voice of young and timid love\nThat calls these melting sounds of sweetness forth.\nWith transport, once, sweet bird! I hail'd thy lay,\nAnd bade thee welcome to our shades again,\nTo charm the wandering poet's pensive way\nAnd soothe the solitary lover's pain;\nBut now!--such evils in my lot combine,\nAs shut my languid sense--to Hope's dear voice and thine!"}
