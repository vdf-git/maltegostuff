{"subject": "The Wood Anemone", "text": "The thorn-tree waved a bough of May\nAnd all its branches bent\nTo indicate the wildwood way\nThe Wind and Sunbeam went.\n\nA wildrose here, a wildrose there\nLifted appealing eyes,\nAnd looked the path they did not dare\nReveal in other wise.\n\nWild parsley tossed a plume of gold\nAnd breathed so sweet a sigh,\nI guessed the way, it never told,\nWhich they had hastened by.\n\nI traced the Beam, so swift and white,\nIn many a woodland place\nBy wildflower footprints of its flight\nAnd gleamings of its grace.\n\nI knew its joy had filled with song\nThe high heart of the bird,\nThat rippled, rippled all day long\nIn dells that hushed and heard.\n\nI knew the Wind with flashing feet\nHad charmed the brook withal,\nWho in its cascades did repeat\nThe music of that call.\n\nAll were in league to help me find,\nOr tell to me the way,\nWhich now before me, now behind,\nThese two had gone in play.\n\nI could not understand how these\nCould hide so near to me,\nWhen by the whispering of the trees\nI knew the wood could see.\n\nUntil, all breathless with its joy,\nThe Wind, that could not rest,\nRan past me, like a romping boy,\nAnd bade me look my best.\n\nAnd there I saw them clasped in bliss\nBeneath an old beech tree:\nAnd-here's the flower born of their kiss\nThis wild anemone.\n\n'Revels the Moon did light.'"}
