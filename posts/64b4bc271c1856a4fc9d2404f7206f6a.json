{"subject": "On A Summer's Day", "text": "I would fly high on the wings of the wind,\n I would sing joyous songs in a treetop\n Tuned, to the melody of the birds.\n I would wave my arms in harmony\n With the trees, swaying slowly to the whirl\n Of their capricious rhythm,\n I would weave a gossamer web to reflect\n The prism radiance of the sun,\n Or grow golden sunflowers, or buttercups,\n Popping up, luxuriating in the velvet turf.\n I would melt into the symphony of the rain\n To become a part of the ebb and flow of nature;\n Or lie outstretched on the warm sand\n As the swirling waves tumble me about.\n I would gaze upward in awe\n At the vastness of azure skies\n Basking in the glory of the universe."}
