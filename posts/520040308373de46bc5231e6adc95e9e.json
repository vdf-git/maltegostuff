{"subject": "Mouse", "text": "Permit me, friends, my evening meal,\nThese few small crumbs of bread I steal,\n\nI mean no harm. Remember that.\nWhy do you shriek and call your cat?\n\nThe Infant's mother fears no mouse\nBut lets me scamper round her house\n\nOf manger hay. Beside this Child,\nLet man and mouse be reconciled."}
