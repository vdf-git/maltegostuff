{"subject": "A Prayer", "text": "SOUL! however sweet \nThe goal to which I hasten with swift feet \u2014\nIf, just within my grasp,\nI reach, and joy to clasp, \nAnd find there one whose body I must make\nA footstool for that sake, \nThough ever and forevermore denied,\nGrant me to turn aside!\n\nO, howsoever dear \nThe love I long for, seek, and find anear \u2014 \nSo near, so dear, the bliss Sweetest of all that is,\nIf I must win by treachery or art,\nOr wrong one other heart, \nThough it should bring me death, my soul, that day\nGrant me to turn away!\n\nThat in the life so far \nAnd yet so near, I be without a scar \nOf wounds dealt others! Greet with lifted eyes\nThe pure of Paradise!\nSo I may never know \nThe agony of tears I caused to flow!"}
