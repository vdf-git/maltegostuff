{"subject": "For Which it Stands", "text": "For a flag! I answered facetiously. A flag of tomorrow,\nfluent in fire, not just the whispers, lisps, not just the still there\nof powdered wigs, dry winds. Who wants a speckled\ndrape that folds as easy over smirch as fallen soldier?\nThis is rhetorical. Like, 'What to the Negro\nis the fourth of July?' A flag should be stitched with a fuse.\n\nJefferson said for each generation a flag. Maybe\nhe said Constitution. I once raised a high-top flag\nof my hair, a fist, a leather medallion of the motherland.\nI studied heraldry and maniples (which are not\nwhat you might guess), little sails and banners\ndown to the vane of a feather. Because his kids were\nrebel cities my father loved like Sherman. Because\nI wanted history I could touch like the flank of a beast.\n\nMy wife's people are from San Salvador. They sent us\nwith a guard, his AK shouldered like a mandolin, among\nanil-tinted shawls and jerseys, across tiled and pocked\nconcrete, and the gated stalls of El Centra. I felt sacred\nas a goat there, too, as I did below the Mason-Dixon\nwhere our only protection was the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nAfraid our Yankee plates would be read aggressive as a Jolly\nRoger we rented a compact in Atlanta. Charleston, Savannah,\nMontgomery, and after Birmingham we were broke.\nSkipped Selma. Slept at B&amp;Bs where my dreams power-\nwashed layers of footnotes and Februaries, revealing\nthe surreal sheen of Apollo Creed's trunks, the apocalyptic\nAmericana of Jacko moonwalking around a tinfoil Buzz\nAldrin planting the corporate ensign. Years passed. I grew\n\nyouthless in my dad-pants, but still puffed at pinwheels\nand windsocks, launched glyphs of grillsmoke and one day\nit came to me, as if commissioned, Theaster Gates's Flag\nfrom old fire hoses, a couple dozen, like vertical blinds, no,\nlike cabin floorboards of canvas colored rusty, brick dust, some\ncheerless drab-and-custard, beside a medley of vespertine\nblues, hoses evoking landscapes of sackcloth and gunny,\ntexture of violence and tongues inflamed by shine, holy ghost.\n\nRoss, Duchamp, Johns, et al., are integrated here with officers\nof the peace, their dogs, and, in evidence, their pretend\ntumescence Gates has hung to cure like pelts\nor strips of jerky.\n\nHow did it feel to shield spirit with flesh? I mean,\nwhat did it do to the body, water furry as the arm\nof an arctic bear? What thirst did it ignite?\n\nGates's salute is a torch song, a rhythm\nof hues marching over a pentimento of rhyme.\nI approve its message, its pledge to birth a nation\nof belonging and to teach that nation of the fire\nshut up in our bones."}
