{"subject": "The Prisoner", "text": "I count the dismal time by months and years\nSince last I felt the green sward under foot,\nAnd the great breath of all things summer-\nMet mine upon my lips. Now earth appears\nAs strange to me as dreams of distant spheres\nOr thoughts of Heaven we weep at. Nature's lute\nSounds on, behind this door so closely shut,\nA strange wild music to the prisoner's ears,\nDilated by the distance, till the brain\nGrows dim with fancies which it feels too\nWhile ever, with a visionary pain,\nPast the precluded senses, sweep and Rhine\nStreams, forests, glades, and many a golden train\nOf sunlit hills transfigured to Divine."}
