{"subject": "Empty Chairs", "text": "I heard the wind return to mourn\n When traveling on that fateful span\n And sensed the nearness of angel wings\n That keep their vigil overhead.\n\n I saw the trees caressed by breeze\n As nodding leaves recite a prayer.\n Their sorrow has not washed away\n Though rains have tried to flush the stain.\n\n The crumbling concrete is gone today\n But vestige of yesterday remains\n In shards that claw the heart and mind\n Where scars survive with endless pain.\n\n Though traffic freely flows again\n And cars adjust to missing friends\n Nightmares torment next of kin\n When ghosts return to claim their space."}
