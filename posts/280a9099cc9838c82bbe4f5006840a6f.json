{"subject": "The Quarrel", "text": "Said a lightning bug to a firefly,\n'Look at the lightning bugs fly by!'\n\n'Silly dunce!' said the fly. 'What bug ever flew?\nThose are fireflies. And so are you.'\n\n'Bug!' cried the bug. 'Fly!' cried the fly.\n'Wait!' said a glowworm happening by.\n\n'I'm a worm,' squirmed the worm. 'I glimmer all night.\nYou are worms, both of you. I know that I'm right.'\n\n'Fly!' cried the fly. 'Worm!' cried the worm.\n'Bug!' cried the bug. 'I'm standing firm!'\n\nBack and forth through the dark each shouted his word\nTill their quarrel awakened the early bird.\n\n'You three noisy things, you are all related,'\nShe said to the worm, and promptly ate it.\n\n With a snap of her bill she finished the fly,\nAnd the lightning bug was the last to die.\n\nAll glowers and glimmerers, there's a MORAL:\nShine if you must, but do not quarrel."}
