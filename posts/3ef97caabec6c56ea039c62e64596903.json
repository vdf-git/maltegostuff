{"subject": "Pathos Of Love", "text": "O Pathos of Love! You are a glossy pearl\nBeware, you should not appear among strangers\n\nThe theatre of your display is concealed under the veil\nThe modern audience' eye accepts only the visible display\n\nNew breeze has arrived in the Existence' garden\nO Pathos of Love! Now there is no pleasure in display\n\nBeware! You should not be striving for ostentation! \nYou should not be obligated to the nightingale's lament! \n\nThe tulip's wine\u2010cup should be devoid of wine\nThe dew's tear should be a mere dropp of water\n\nYour secret should be hidden in the bosom somewhere\nYour heart\u2010melting tear should not be your betrayer\n\nThe flowery\u2010styled poet's tongue should not be talking\nSeparation's complaint should not be concealed in flute's music\n\nThis age is a critic, go and somewhere conceal yourself\nIn the heart in which you are residing conceal yourself\n\nThe learning's surprise is neglecting you, beware! \nYour immature eye is not the seeker of Truth, beware\n\nLet the elegant thought remain in search of Truth\nLet your wisdom\u2010loving eye remain in astonishment\n\nThis is not the garden whose spring you may be\nThis is not the audience worthy of your appearance\n\nThis audience is the lover of the material sights\nThe purpose of your sight is the closet of secrecy\n\nEvery heart is intoxicated with the wine of thinking\nSomething different is the Tur of the Kalims of this age"}
