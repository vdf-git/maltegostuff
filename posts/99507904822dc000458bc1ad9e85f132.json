{"subject": "Love And Strange Horses\u2014intima'? -", "text": "One hundred breaths split the air\nas I lean\non the only pine tree I find.\nIt's early or late, it's breezy or hot.\nThe fields are dry. Summer is near.\nThe horses are everywhere,\nstrangely galloping a dream,\nbut I can't remember\nhow to call them,\nso I stand back, watch them pass.\n\nThe first time I rode a horse\nmy body found the music of fire,\ncrackling the wind. An unbearable pleasure\nthat also left me with a burn on the side of my leg.\nA sign, the horsekeeper told me, of longing.\nA need to return\u2014to belong.\nAfter all, departure is like\npushing the weight of our heart\nagainst the village\nwhose name has kept us awake.\n\nRafael came from somewhere in Eurasia.\nI passed my hands through his mane\u2014\nsaw a history of conquests and battles,\na field of hay, a mount of truth,\nheard a silent ring,\nhis eyes asking me to go with him,\nto confess something sacred,\nto name something lustful.\nNothing of where he came from,\nor who I was, disturbed us.\n\nI knew he was different by the way he ran\u2014\nwithout pause,\nwithout grace,\nwithout distraction,\nwithout ease.\nHe was told how to move in the world\nand resented it.\nHe knew he would never own anything.\n\nHe came toward me.\nIt was a quiet afternoon.\nI stood unmoving.\nAnd we listened to the untitled music\ncircling the earth like an anthem\nfree of its nation.\n\nHe was unfamiliar to me,\napproaching as if he possessed the land.\nEvery morning he stopped five feet\nfrom the river."}
