{"subject": "A New Pilgrimage: Sonnet Xix", "text": "Alas, that words like these should be but folly!\nBehold, the Boulevard mocks, and I mock too.\nLet us away and purge our melancholy\nWith the last laughter at the Ambigu!\nHere all is real. Here glory's self is true\nThrough each regime to its own mission holy\nOf plying still the world with something new\nTo cure its ache, or nobly souled or lowly.\nOne title Paris holds above the rest\nUntouched by time or fortune's change or frown,\nOne temple of high fame, where she sits dressed\nIn youth eternal, and mirth's myrtle crown,\nAnd where she writes, each night, with deathless hands,\n''To all the glories--of the stage--of France.''"}
