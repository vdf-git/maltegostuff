{"subject": "Evening", "text": "From upland slopes I see the cows file by,\n  Lowing, great-chested, down the homeward trail,\n  By dusking fields and meadows shining pale\n  With moon-tipped dandelions. Flickering high,\n  A peevish night-hawk in the western sky\n  Beats up into the lucent solitudes,\n  Or drops with griding wing. The stilly woods\n  Grow dark and deep, and gloom mysteriously.\n  Cool night winds creep, and whisper in mine ear.\n  The homely cricket gossips at my feet.\n  From far-off pools and wastes of reeds I hear,\n  Clear and soft-piped, the chanting frogs break sweet\n  In full Pandean chorus. One by one\n  Shine out the stars, and the great night comes on."}
