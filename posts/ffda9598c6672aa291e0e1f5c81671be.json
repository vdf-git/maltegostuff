{"subject": "Urine Therapy", "text": "After the needles, the yoga, he turned to urine therapy \nso each morning he rose and peed into a pint glass \nthen downed it in one. At first it was difficult not to gag \nbut he kept in his head the image of that 120-years-old \nJapanese man who ascribed his longevity to drinking his pee \nevery morning since the day of his 21st birthday, \nand who came across, on TV, as being fitter than a flea. \n\nAnd he collected all the writings of John W. Armstrong \nwho'd developed the therapy in the 1930s \nas a way of cleansing the body by reingesting toxins - \nan ingenious and impertinent double bluff, he thought \nand imagined John W.'s first tentative sipping \nof the warm, newly delivered, deep yellow liquid \nbehind the securely locked door of his bathroom. \n\nNo, he would never let a taste and a smell beat him, \nand soon the variants in both led him to nudge \nhis diet to the bolder peripheries - curries, garlic, \nasparagus, of course, the lemongrass and rotted shrimp \nof Thailand, sashimi, chilli and basil, cabbage - \nand along with the assortment of freshly squeezed juices \nhe slipped in the odd whisky or brandy night-cap \n\nto give the slightest of frissons to that first sip \nthe following morning, and bring a smile to the face \nbehind which all the illnesses he was ruling out \nwere being listed, and all extra years he'd live \nwere being added up, and all the wrong-footed toxins \nwere unwittingly working so hard for him \nbefore his grapefruit, his coffee, his wholemeal toast and jam."}
