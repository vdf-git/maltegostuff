{"subject": "The Better Job", "text": "If I were running a factory\nI'd stick up a sign for all to see,\nI'd print it large and I'd nail it high\nOn every wall that the men walked by,\nAnd I'd have it carry this sentence clear:\n'The Better Job that you want is here!'*\n\nIt's the common trait of the human race\nTo pack up and roam from place to place;\nMen have done it for ages and do it now,\nSeeking to better themselves somehow;\nThey quit their posts and their tools they drop\nFor a better job in another shop.\n\nIt may be I'm wrong, but I hold to this\nThat somewhere something must be amiss\nWhen a man worth while must move away\nFor the better job with the better pay;\nAnd something is false in our own renown\nWhen men can think of a better town.\n\nSo if I were running a factory\nI'd stick up this sign for all to see,\nWhich never an eye in the place could miss :\n'There isn't a better town than this;\nYou need not go wandering, far or near\nThe Better Job that you want is here!'"}
