{"subject": "Dawn", "text": "At the dawning of the day,\nOn the road to Gunnedah,\nWhen the sky is pink and grey\nAs the wings of a wild galah,\nAnd the last night-shadow ebbs\nFrom the trees like a falling tide,\nAnd the dew-hung spiderwebs\nOn the grass-blades spread far and wide -\nEach sharp spike loaded well,\nBent down low with the heavy dew -\nWait the daily miracle\nWhen the world is all made anew:\nWhen the sun's rim lifts beyond\nThe horizon turned crystal-white,\nAnd a sea of diamond\nIs the plain to the dazzled sight. \n\nAt the dawning of the day,\nTo my happiness thus it fell:\nThat 1 went the common way,\nAnd 1 witnessed a miracle."}
