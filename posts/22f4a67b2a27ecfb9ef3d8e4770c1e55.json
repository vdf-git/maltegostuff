{"subject": "Tomorrow", "text": "He was going to be all that a mortal should be\n      Tomorrow.\nNo one should be kinder or braver than he\n      Tomorrow.\nA friend who was troubled and weary he knew,\nWho'd be glad of a lift and who needed it, too;\nOn him he would call and see what he could do\n      Tomorrow.\n\nEach morning he stacked up the letters he'd write\n      Tomorrow.\nAnd thought of the folks he would fill with delight\n      Tomorrow.\nIt was too bad, indeed, he was busy today,\nAnd hadn't a minute to stop on his way;\nMore time he would have to give others, he'd say\n      Tomorrow.\n\nThe greatest of workers this man would have been\n      Tomorrow.\nThe world would have known him, had he ever seen\n      Tomorrow.\nBut the fact is he died and he faded from view,\nAnd all that he left here when living was through\nWas a mountain of things he intended to do\n      Tomorrow."}
