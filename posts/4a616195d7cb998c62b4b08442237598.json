{"subject": "Learning to Speak", "text": "She was the quietest thing I'd ever seen.\nIt was so restful, being in her company\nFor hours, neither of us uttering a word.\nI'd read the paper, look up, and she would smile,\nHer lips half-pursed, just tucked up at the ends\nAs if holding a blithe secret.\nWhen I fed her, she'd silently nod and smile,\nLike immigrants you see\nIn train stations or in the movies,\nShe'd take the bowl from my hands\nAnd nod again and smile again\nAnd neither of us would say a word\nFrom sunup to sunset.\nWhen son and husband came home,\nBoth talking at once, both talking\nWith their mouths full,\nMy daughter and I could only look at them\nWith our dark quiet eyes.\nSiddown, she says now.\nI sit down\nWithout argument."}
