{"subject": "Words For Departure", "text": "Nothing was remembered, nothing forgotten.\nWhen we awoke, wagons were passing on the warm summer pavements,\nThe window-sills were wet from rain in the night,\nBirds scattered and settled over chimneypots\nAs among grotesque trees.\n\nNothing was accepted, nothing looked beyond.\nSlight-voiced bells separated hour from hour,\nThe afternoon sifted coolness\nAnd people drew together in streets becoming deserted.\nThere was a moon, and light in a shop-front,\nAnd dusk falling like precipitous water.\n\nHand clasped hand\nForehead still bowed to forehead--\nNothing was lost, nothing possessed\nThere was no gift nor denial.\n\n2\nI have remembered you.\nYou were not the town visited once,\nNor the road falling behind running feet.\n\nYou were as awkward as flesh\nAnd lighter than frost or ashes.\n\nYou were the rind,\nAnd the white-juiced apple,\nThe song, and the words waiting for music.\n\n3\nYou have learned the beginning;\nGo from mine to the other.\n\nBe together; eat, dance, despair,\nSleep, be threatened, endure.\nYou will know the way of that.\n\nBut at the end, be insolent;\nBe absurd--strike the thing short off;\nBe mad--only do not let talk\nWear the bloom from silence.\n\nAnd go away without fire or lantern\nLet there be some uncertainty about your departure."}
