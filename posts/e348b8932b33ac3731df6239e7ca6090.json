{"subject": "Story-Time", "text": "'TELL us a story,' comes the cry           \nFrom little lips when nights are cold,       \nAnd in the grate the flames leap high.           \n'Tell us a tale of pirates bold,       \nOr fairies hiding in the glen,           \nOr of a ship that's wrecked at sea.'       \nI fill my pipe, and there and then           \nGather the children round my knee.\n\nI give them all a role to play-            \nNo longer are they youngsters small,       \nAnd I, their daddy, turning gray;           \nWe are adventurers, one and all.       \nWe journey forth as Robin Hood           \nIn search of treasure, or to do       \nSome deed of daring, or of good,           \nOur hearts are ever brave and true.       \n\nWe take a solemn oath to be           \nDefenders of the starry flag;       \nWe brave the winter's stormy sea,           \nOr climb the rugged mountain crag,       \nTo battle to the death with those           \nWho would defame our native land;       \nWe pitch our camp among the snows           \nOr in the tropics burning sand.       \n\nWe rescue maidens, young and fair,           \nHeld captive long in prison towers;       \nWe slay the villain in his lair,           \nFor we're possessed of magic powers.       \nAnd though we desperately fight,           \nWhen by our foes we are beset,       \nWe always triumph for the right;           \nWe have not lost a battle yet.       \n\nIt matters not how far we stray,           \nNor where our battle lines may be,       \nWe never get so far away           \nThat we must spend a night at sea.       \nIt matters not how high we climb,           \nHow many foes our pathway block,       \nWe always conquer just in time           \nTo go to bed at 9 o'clock."}
