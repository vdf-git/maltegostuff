{"subject": "A Mountain Song", "text": "We are wild as the storm \nWe are restless as the spring \nWe are fearless like god and generous like nature.\n\nWe are as free as the sky \nWe are Bedouin, the deserts wandering tribe. \nWe know no king\n        nor any king's laws, \nWe submit to no rule or regulation, \nWe are born free with it mind' \n        open as the blossoming lotus. \nWe are the murmuring flood tide of the sea \n        and the warbling waters of the mountain spring\n\nWe are generous hearted wide open meadows... \nWe are mighty invincible hills \nWe are flying birds with outstretched wings \nWe are bubbling laughter and gay songs.\n\nWe eat wild fruits and drink rain water \nWe sleep under trees in the depth of green forests \nWe are the gushing river of life. \nWe are the flowing waters of mountain brooks\n        warbling singing roaring\n        always restless and ever on the move."}
