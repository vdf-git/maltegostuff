{"subject": "Snow", "text": "It's cold today the temperature dips\n Old man winter gives a chuckle\n Hugging his hips.\n The cars are mad, the drivers sad\n The roads go to sleep\n Leaving some to weep,\n Give me sun they say, give me rain\n But don't send another inch of snow again.\n The byways crumble with abandoned cars\n While guys trade winter tales in crowded bars;\n Snow is nice as the flakes rain down\n But once it's here it makes us moan,\n Ain't complaining, not fussin at all\n Just a little sore from yesterday's fall;\n Give me sun they say, give me rain\n But don't send another inch of snow again."}
