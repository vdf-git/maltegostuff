{"subject": "The Confession", "text": "ALAS! I fear I cannot longer steel\nMy heart against the magic of thy pow'r;\nUnusual flutt'rings in my breast I feel,\nAnd new emotions struggling ev'ry hour.\n\nO! thou, most delicate, and most refin'd,\n'Tis sacrilege to say I fear to love\nA being, gifted thus with charms of mind,\nSo form'd that passion to inspire and prove.\n\nBut, traitor! wherefore teach my heart to burn,\nRound which the stream of apathy did flow?\nAh! wherefore bid the freezing current turn,\nAnd leave that heart with Etna's fires to glow?\n\nSay, was it by the light'ning of thine eyes,\nWhich, mine encount'ring, so my soul inflam'd?\nOr did thy glowing breath, with magic sighs,\nEnkindle mischief more than may be nam'd?\n\nMischief indeed!--but ah! I would not change\nMischief so sweet for all the world could give;\nSo vile a slave I'm grown, I would not range\nBeyond my chain, nor liberty receive.\n\nThou gazest on me, and thy gaze but serves\nThro' all my veins to send tumultuous sweets;\nAnd at thy touch with transports thrill my nerves,\nMy bosom with increas'd emotion beats.\n\nYes, yes, I own what 'tis in vain to hide,\nI love thee more than language can express;\nThou'st conquer'd apathy and giant pride;\nAnd abject wretches, they the conqu'ror bless."}
