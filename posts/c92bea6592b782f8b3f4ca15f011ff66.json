{"subject": "Scar", "text": "What is it you forget in your vigil,\ncell after cell like petals on the grave \nof first days, so often strange, your veil\nof skin ruffled, renewed, as if you grieved\n\nin the blind color of too much light.\nSo late you sleep there, so leaden the pour\nof suns that cannot touch you. The blood you let, \nthe foaming of the crevice\u2014what old prayer\n\nof needle and thread could ever answer\nthe power of arrival. The body opens\nits red door which in turn opens the flare\nof the eye. Don't you remember. You pinned\n\neach to itself like an armless sleeve. \nUnlikely, true. White shadow of the wound \nthat is no wound. The wind in the leaves \nand the sound it makes, after the wind."}
