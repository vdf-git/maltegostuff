{"subject": "I am a child and free", "text": "to live in perpetual Sunday\nsun perched on the horizon\nin each thing's clarity\nearth contemplates its seasons\nI have no place or dwelling\nlife is everywhere and nowhere\n\nfrom the courtyard cistern the grandmother draws\nwater for the mint and basil\ngrinds the salt and spices\nwages her daily battle with the real world\nthe breeze swells out stripes on the curtains\nthe lamp still glows\nI play beyond the pictures\n\nin my father's gardens\nthe trees bear ancient fruit\nwhisper in the birds' language\nwell-water sings in the furrows\nbeneath my steps sand-paths are born\nI inhabit the day's innocence\npure beginning with no before or after\n\nfrom a little house built like a boat\nI let myself flow into blue emotion\na sea-horse ballet brushes\nagainst fallen stars\nsea-urchins blossom on the rocks\nseaweed glitters on my wrist\nonly the moment lives in what I gaze at\n\nI am a child and free\nI have no place or dwelling\nhow vast the sky is when the whole\nworld is a poem\nit's broad daylight on earth\nnight has not yet been created\nI have a foothold in all of time\n\nTranslation: Marilyn Hacker"}
