{"subject": "The Station Agent's Story", "text": "Take a seat in the shade here, lady;\nIt's tiresome, I know, to wait;\nBut when the train reaches Verona\nIt's always sure to be late, \u2015\n'Specially when any one's waitin'.\nBeen gatherin' flowers, I see?\nAh, well! they're better company\nThan a rough old fellow like me.\n\nYou noticed the graves 'neath the willows,\nDown there where the blossoms grew?\nWell, yes, there's a story about them,\nAlmost too strange to be true;\n'Tis a stranger, sweeter story\nThan was ever written in books;\nAnd God made the endin' so perfect \u2015\nThere, now I see by your looks\n\nI will have to tell the story:\nLet me see; 'twas eight years ago\nOne blusterin' night in winter,\nWhen the air was thick with snow;\nAs the freight came round the curve there\nThey beheld a man on the track,\nBravin' the storm before him, but\nNot heedin' the foe at his back.\n\nAnd ere a hand could grasp the bell-rope,\nOr a finger reach the rod,\nOne sweep from the cruel snow-plough\nHad sent the man's soul to its God!\nThey laid him out here in the freight-house,\nAnd I stayed with him that night;\nHe'd one of the pleasantest faces,\nSo hopeful and young and bright.\n\nThere was only a worn-out letter;\nI know it by heart \u2015 it said:\n'Dear John: Baby May grows finely,\nI send you this curl from her head.\nWe will meet you at Brackenboro'.\nThe grandfather's sad and lone,\nBut I read him your kind words, sayin',\nWhen we've a home of our own,'\n\n'He shall sing the songs of old England\nBeneath our own willow tree.'\nThat was all there was of it, lady,\nAnd 't was signed just 'Alice Leigh.'\nSo we made a grave in the mornin'\nAnd buried the man out there\nAlone, unmourned, in a stranger's land,\nWith only a stranger's prayer.\n\nBut when he'd slept in his lonely grave\nOut there nigh on to a year,\nRay's freight ran into a washout\nBy the culvert, away down here;\nThere were only two passengers that night,\nDead when we found them there, \u2015\nA sweet little Englishwoman,\nAnd a baby with golden hair.\n\nOn her breast lay the laughing baby,\nWith its rosy finger-tips\nStill warm, and the fair young mother\nWith a frozen smile on her lips.\nWe laid them out here in the freight-house,\nI stayed that night with the dead;\nI shall never forget the letter\nWe found in her purse; it said:\n\n'Dear Alice: Praise God I've got here!\nI'll soon have a home for you now;\nBut you must come with the baby\nAs soon as you can anyhow.\nComfort the grandfather, and tell him\nThat by and by he shall come,\nAnd sing the songs of old England\n'Neath the willows beside our home;'\n\n'For, close by the door of our cottage\nI'll set out a willow tree,\nFor his sake and the sake of old England.\nLovingly yours. John Leigh.'\n\nThe tears filled my eyes as I read it;\nBut I whispered, 'God is just!'\nFor I knew the true heart yonder \u2015\nThen only a handful of dust \u2015\nHad drawn this sweet little woman\nRight here, and God's merciful love\nHad taken her from the sorrow\nTo the glad reunion above!\n\nSo, close by the grave of the other\nWe laid her away to rest, \u2015\nThe golden-haired English mother,\nWith the baby upon her breast.\nI planted those trees above them,\nFor I knew their story, you see;\nAnd I thought their rest would be sweeter\n'Neath their own loved willow tree.\n\nFive years rolled along; and, lady,\nMy story may now seem to you\nLike a wonderful piece of fiction;\nBut I tell you it is true, \u2015\nAs true as that God is above us!\nOne summer day, hot and clear,\nAs the train rolled into the station\nAnd stopped to change engines here,\n\nAmong a company of Mormons\nCame a tremblin' white-haired man;\nHe asked me in waverin' accents,\n'Will you tell me, sir, if you can,\nOf a place called Brackenboro'?\nAnd how far have I got to go?'\n'It's the next station north,' I answered,\n'Only thirteen miles below.'\n\nHis old face lit up for a moment\nWith a look of joy complete;\nThen he threw up his hands toward Heaven,\nAnd dropped down dead at my feet!\n'Old Hugh Leigh is dead!' said a Mormon,\n'And sights o' trouble he's be 'n.\nNothin' would do when we started\nBut that he must come with us then,'\n\n'To find Alice, John, and the baby;\nAnd his heart was well-nigh broke\nWith waitin' and watchin' in England\nFor letters they never wrote.'\nSo we buried him there with the others,\nBeneath the willow tree.\n'T was God's way of endin' the story \u2015\nMore perfect than man's could be."}
