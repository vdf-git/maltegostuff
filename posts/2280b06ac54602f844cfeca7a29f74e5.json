{"subject": "The Optimist", "text": "The fields were bleak and sodden. Not a wing\nOr note enlivened the depressing wood, \nA soiled and sullen, stubborn snowdrift stood\nBeside the roadway. Winds came muttering\nOf storms to be, and brought the chilly sting\nOf icebergs in their breath. Stalled cattle mooed\nForth plaintive pleadings for the earth's green food.\nNo gleam, no hint of hope in anything.\n\nThe sky was blank and ashen, like the face\nOf some poor wretch who drains life's cup too fast.\nYet, swaying to and fro, as if to fling\nAbout chilled Nature its lithe arms of grace, \nSmiling with promise in the wintry blast, \nThe optimistic Willow spoke of spring."}
