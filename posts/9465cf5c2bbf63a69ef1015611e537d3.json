{"subject": "A Serenade To My Mother", "text": "I remember your old face\nMy precious mother and very sweet\nWith light wrinkles and lines\nMy precious one and very sweet.\n\nYou are sitting on the porch\nAlongside the growing fig tree\nThrowing a shadow on your face\nMy precious mother and very sweet.\n\nYou are sitting sadly and silently\nRemembering those old days\nThat have come and also gone by\nMy precious mother and very sweet.\n\nAnd you remember your own son\nWho had left you and gone far.\n'Where has he gone ?' You wonder,\nMy precious one and very sweet.\n\n'Where is he now?' You wonder,\n'Is he alive or is he dead?\nAnd what doors has he been knocking?'\nMy precious one and very sweet.\n\nAnd you wonder if he's been tired\nOr if he's been cheated by love;\nAnd in whose laps has he made love?\nMy precious one and very sweet.\n\nYou are thinking sadly\nWhile the fig tree keeps rocking.\nYour sorrow has no limits indeed\nMy precious one and very sweet.\n\nAnd then sour tears\nDrop down your eyes one by one\nUpon your weary hands\nMy precious one and very sweet."}
