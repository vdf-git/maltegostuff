{"subject": "Pa Did It!", "text": "The train of cars that Santa brought is out of kilter now;\nWhile pa was showing how they went he broke the spring somehow.\nThey used to run around a track\u2014at least they did when he\nWould let me take them in my hands an' wind 'em with a key.\nI could 'a' had some fun with 'em, if only they would go,\nBut, gee! I never had a chance, for pa enjoyed em so.\n\nThe automobile that I got that ran around the floor\nWas lots of fun when it was new, but it won't go no more.\nPa wound it up for Uncle Jim to show him how it went,\nAnd when those two got through with it the runnin' gear was bent,\nAn' now it doesn't go at all. I mustn't grumble though,\n'Cause while it was in shape to run my pa enjoyed it so.\n\nI've got my blocks as good as new, my mitts are perfect yet;\nAlthough the snow is on the ground I haven't got em wet.\nI've taken care of everything that Santa brought to me,\nExcept the toys that run about when wound up with a key.\nBut next year you can bet I won't make any such mistake;\nI'm going to ask for toys an' things that my pa cannot break."}
