{"subject": "The Joy If Church Fellowship Rightly Attended", "text": "In heaven soaring up, I dropped an ear\nOn earth: and Oh, sweet melody:\nAnd listening, found it was the saints who were\nEncroached for Heaven that sang for joy. \nFor in Christ's coach they sweetly sing,\nAs they to glory ride therein.\n\nOh, joyous hearts! Enfired with holy flame!\nIs speech thus tassled with praise?\nWill not your inward fire of joy contain:\nThat it in open flames doth blaze?\nFor in Christ's coach saints sweetly sing,\nAs they to glory ride therein.\n\nAnd if a string do slip by chance, they soon\nDo screw it up again, whereby\nThey set it in a more melodious tune\nAnd a diviner harmony.\nFor in Christ's coach they sweetly sing,\nAs they to glory ride therein.\n\nIn all their acts, public and private, nay,\nAnd secret too, they praise impart.\nBut in their acts divine and worship, they \nWith hymns do offer up their heart.\nThus in Christ's coach they sweetly sing,\nAs they to glory ride therein.\n\nSome few not in; and some whose time and place\nBlock up this coach's way do go\nAs travelers afoot, and so do trace\nThe road that gives them right thereto,\nWhile in this coach these sweetly sing,\nAs they to glory ride therein."}
