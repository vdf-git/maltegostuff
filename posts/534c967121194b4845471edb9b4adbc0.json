{"subject": "Sonnet Xii: Cupid, Because Thou", "text": "Cupid, because thou shin'st in Stella's eyes, \nThat from her locks, thy day-nets, noe scapes free, \nThat those lips swell, so full of thee they be, \nThat her sweet breath makes oft thy flames to rise, \n\nThat in her breast thy pap well sugared lies, \nThat he Grace gracious makes thy wrongs, that she \nWhat words so ere she speak persuades for thee, \nThat her clear voice lifts thy fame to the skies: \n\nThou countest Stella thine, like those whose powers \nHaving got up a breach by fighting well, \nCry, \"Victory, this fair day all is ours.\" \n\nOh no, her heart is such a citadel, \nSo fortified with wit, stored with disdain, \nThat to win it, is all the skill and pain."}
