{"subject": "Homage To Tom Andrews", "text": "The birds break and wheel. \nFall out of, back into, their loose-\n     weave wave. Define a falling \narc. They fall like dark water\n     or a chain of dark molecules \nthat ripples and falls like water. \n     How they dis- and re- and dis-\norder themselves\u2014then do it \n     again, altered almost imperceptibly \nthis time by a crabby cabbie's \n     double beep-beep. Gray birds, gray \nsky: one more dirty daily miracle \n     I hold out to you. Dear Tom,\nhow's heaven? Here in Astoria\n     it's January, month of the two-faced \ngod, and I look both ways \n     before crossing the street to reach\nthis better vantage point, here \n     beneath a flashing orange \nhand: not a wave, but a warning. \n     There must be a formula \nto account for these wheels \n     and arcs, these waves. A how, \nif one has the patience, needs the proof; \n     if beauty is, again, not enough,\neven in Queens. If we keep \n     wishing for a story, a\nsong, some lovelier way to say \n     what happens, then deeper \ndown let us find a why and, further \n     still, its echo: a why not \nthat makes this music. Til then,\n     Tom, I won't let anyone ask me\nwhy I'm trying so hard not \n     to forget they're just pigeons,\nbut to forget that word just."}
