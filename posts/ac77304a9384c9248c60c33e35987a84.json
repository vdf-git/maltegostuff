{"subject": "Lucasta's World", "text": "I.\n\nCold as the breath of winds that blow \nTo silver shot descending snow, \nLucasta sigh't; when she did close \nThe world in frosty chaines! \nAnd then a frowne to rubies frose \nThe blood boyl'd in our veines: \nYet cooled not the heat her sphere \nOf beauties first had kindled there.\n\nII.\n\nThen mov'd, and with a suddaine flame \nImpatient to melt all againe, \nStraight from her eyes she lightning hurl'd, \nAnd earth in ashes mournes; \nThe sun his blaze denies the world, \nAnd in her luster burnes: \nYet warmed not the hearts, her nice \nDisdaine had first congeal'd to ice.\n\nIII.\n\nAnd now her teares nor griev'd desire \nCan quench this raging, pleasing fire; \nFate but one way allowes; behold \nHer smiles' divinity! \nThey fann'd this heat, and thaw'd that cold, \nSo fram'd up a new sky. \nThus earth, from flames and ice repreev'd, \nE're since hath in her sun-shine liv'd."}
