{"subject": "King In The Air", "text": "On the lofty heights of heaven above cloud,\n eagle, and star where love scatters\n on breezes all its perfume and tenerness,\nLies the land of the poet who in spirit,\n not body-has soared from the first,\nHis muse placed him there far from the world \nand its cruelty; A king, whose palace \nis the vault of the sky and whose \nrule ranges through the aether's heart;\nWho wanders in space attended by light, \nfollowed by the brides of his dreams.\nHis kingdom is founded on air,\n and how mighty that foundation laid on eternity.\nHis throne is a seat of clouds, \nwhereon night has shed awesome designs.\nHis crown is an aureole of sliver,\n wherein the horizon has set moon by star.\nDusk cloaks him, its bright stars diffusing \nessence of camphor above amber-perfumed night.\nThe pleiades in his land are a scepter\n whose pearls morning gathers into its sleeves.\nHe is a king flying without wings,\n ruling by the power of imagination and renow:\nO wings of imagination, mightiest of wings,\n against whom the winds break their back.\nwould that I knew if the poet-but for his flesh \nand bone-be not a son of this earth,\nTo leave her if he chose, at will; \nfor was he not led to her unwillingly?\nHe is hers, yet not hers, always \na stranger among his mother's sons."}
