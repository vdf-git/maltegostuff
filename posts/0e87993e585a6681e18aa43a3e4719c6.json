{"subject": "Ii. Great God, And Just! How Canst", "text": "Great God, and just! how canst Thou see, \nDear God, our miserie, \nAnd not in mercy set us free? \nPoor miserable man! how wert thou born, \nWeek as the dewy jewels of the morn, \nRapt up in tender dust, \nGuarded with sins and lust, \nWho like Court-flatterers waite \nTo serve themselves in thy unhappy fate. \nWealth is a snare, and poverty brings in \nInlets of theft, paving the way for sin: \nEach perfum'd vanity doth gently breath \nSin in thy Soul, and whispers it to Death. \nOur faults like ulcerated sores do go \nO're the sound flesh, and do corrupt that too: \nLord, we are sick, spotted with sin: \nThick as a crusty leaper's skin; \nLike Naaman, bid us wash, yet let it be \nIn streams of blood that flow from Thee: \nThen will we sing. \nTouch'd by the heavenly Dove's bright wing, \nHallelujahs, psalms and praise \nTo God the Lord of night and dayes; \nEver good, and ever just, \nEver high, Who ever must \nThus be sung; is still the same; \nEternal praises crown His name. \nAmen."}
