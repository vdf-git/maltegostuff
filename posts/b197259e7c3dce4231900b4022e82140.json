{"subject": "For Love Of You My Lute Was Strung", "text": "FOR love of you my lute was strung,\nWhen singing days were fair and young,\nWhen life and hope and song were new,\nAnd all were sweet for love of you.\nFor love of you from June to June\nMy heart beat to a triumph tune,\nAnd music rose by sea and land,\nIn answer to a victor's hand.\nFor love of you from sun to sun,\nI strove to sing when songs were done,\nAnd on each failing string my tears\nBurnt silence, through the empty years.\nBut broken now 'neath evening skies,\nMy lute for ever tuneless lies,\nAnd I but mourn the songs I knew,\nWhich were so sweet for love of you."}
