{"subject": "Dedicatory Poem", "text": "Dear Carrie, were we truly wise,\nAnd could discern with finer eyes,\nAnd half-inspired sense,\nThe ways of Providence:\n\nCould we but know the hidden things\nThat brood beneath the Future's wings,\nHermetically sealed,\nBut soon to be revealed:\n\nWould we, more blest than we are now,\nIn due submission learn to bow,-\nReceiving on our knees\nThe Omnipotent decrees?\n\nThat which is just, we have. And we\nWho lead this round of mystery,\nThis dance of strange unrest,\nWhat are we at the best?-\n\nUnless we learn to mount and climb;\nWriting upon the page of time,\nIn words of joy or pain,\nThat we've not lived in vain.\n\nWe all are Ministers of Good;\nAnd where our mission's understood,\nHow many hearts we must\nRaise, trembling, from the dust.\n\nOh, strong young soul, and thinking brain!\nWalk wisely through the fair domain\nWhere burn the sacred fires\nOf Music's sweet desires!\n\nCherish thy Gift; and let it be\nA Jacob's ladder unto thee,\nDown which the Angels come,\nTo bring thee dreams of Home.\n\nWhat were we if the pulse of Song\nHad never beat, nor found a tongue\nTo make the Poet known\nIn lands beyond his own?\n\nTake what is said for what is meant.\nWe sometimes touch the firmament\nOf starry Thought-no more;\nBeyond, we may not soar.\n\nI speak not of myself, but stand\nIn silence till the Master Hand\nEach fluttering thought sets free.\nGod holds the golden key."}
