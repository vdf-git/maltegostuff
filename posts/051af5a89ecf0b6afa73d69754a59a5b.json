{"subject": "Gingerbread", "text": "'Gingerbread,\nGo to the head.\nYour task is done;\nA soul is won.\nTake it and go\nWhere muffins grow,\nWhere sweet loaves rise\nTo the very skies,\nAnd biscuits fair\nPerfume the air.\nAway, away!\nMake no delay;\nIn the sea of flour\nPlunge this hour.\nSafe in your breast\nLet the yeast-cake rest,\nTill you rise in joy,\nA white bread boy!'"}
