{"subject": "The Kesselstadt Mask", "text": "(FROM AN ARTISTIC POINT OF VIEW).\n\nThat round-cheeked, flat-faced Stratford bust\nSank one's ideal to the dust,\nBut heaven be praised, for by its grace\nWe have found our Shakespeare's face.\nGerard's own bust they well could spare,\nSo they mounted it up there!\nAs for the portrait by Droeshout,\nPerhaps his fingers had the gout!\nBut here's the king of men divine,\u2014\nThe Elizabethan profile line,\u2014\nLet Gerard and Droeshout give place\u2014\nWe have found our Shakespeare's face."}
