{"subject": "To John J. Knickerbocker, Jr.", "text": "Whereas, good friend, it doth appear\nYou do possess the notion\nTo his awhile away from here\nTo lands across the ocean;\nNow, by these presents we would show\nThat, wheresoever wend you,\nAnd wheresoever gales may blow,\nOur friendship shall attend you.\n\nWhat though on Scotia's banks and braes\nYou pluck the bonnie gowan,\nOr chat of old Chicago days\nO'er Berlin brew with Cowen;\nWhat though you stroll some boulevard\nIn Paris (c'est la belle ville!),\nOr make the round of Scotland Yard\nWith our lamented Melville?\n\nShall paltry leagues of foaming brine\nTrue heart from true hearts sever?\nNo--in this draught of honest wine\nWe pledge it, comrade--never!\nThough mountain waves between us roll,\nCome fortune or disaster--\n'Twill knit us closer soul to soul\nAnd bind our friendships faster.\n\nSo here's a bowl that shall be quaff'd\nTo loyalty's devotion,\nAnd here's to fortune that shall waft\nYour ship across the ocean,\nAnd here's a smile for those who prate\nOf Davy Jones's locker,\nAnd here's a pray'r in every fate--\nGod bless you, Knickerbocker!"}
