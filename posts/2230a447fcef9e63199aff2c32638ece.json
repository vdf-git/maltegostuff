{"subject": "On The Cliffs, Newport", "text": "Tonight a shimmer of gold lies mantled o'er \nSmooth lovely Ocean. Through the lustrous gloom \nA savor steals from linden trees in bloom \nAnd gardens ranged at many a palace door. \nProud walls rise here, and, where the moonbeams pour \nTheir pale enchantment down the dim coast-line, \nTerrace and lawn, trim hedge and flowering vine, \nCrown with fair culture all the sounding shore. \nHow sweet, to such a place, on such a night, \nFrom halls with beauty and festival a-glare, \nTo come distract and, stretched on the cool turf, \nYield to some fond, improbable delight, \nWhile the moon, reddening, sinks, and all the air \nSighs with the muffled tumult of the surf!"}
