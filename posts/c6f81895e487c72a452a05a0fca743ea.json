{"subject": "On the Terrace", "text": "The lonely breakfast table starts the day,\nan adjustment is made to understand\nwhy the other chair is empty. The morning\nbeautiful and still to be, should woo me. Yet\nthe appetite is not shared, lost somewhere in memory.\n\nHow lucky the horizon is blue and needs\nno handwriting on its emptiness. I am\nwritten on thoroughly, a lost novel\nfound again. I remember the predictable plot too late,\nrealize the silly, sad urgency of moss."}
