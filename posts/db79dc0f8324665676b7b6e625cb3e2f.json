{"subject": "Summer Afternoon", "text": "FAR in hollow mountain car\u00f1ons \nBrood with purple-folded pinions, \nFlocks of drowsy distance-colors, on their nests; \nAnd the bare round slopes for forests \nHave cloud-shadows, floating forests, \nOn their breasts. \n\nWinds are wakening and dying, \nQuestions low with low replying, \nThrough the oak a hushed and trembling whisper goes: \nFaint and rich the air with odors, \nHyacinth and spicy odors \nOf the rose. \n\nEven the flowerless acacia \nIs one flower\u2014such slender stature, \nWith its latticed leaves a-tremble in the sun: \nThey have shower-drops for blossoms, \nQuivering globes of diamond-blossoms, \nEvery one. \n\nIn the blue of heaven holy \nClouds go floating, floating slowly, \nPure in snowy robe and sunny silver crown; \nAnd they seem like gentle angels\u2014 \nLeisure-full and loitering angels, \nLooking down. \n\nHalf the birds are wild with singing, \nAnd the rest with rhythmic winging \nSing in melody of motion to the sight; \nEvery little sparrow twitters, \nCheerily chirps, and cheeps, and twitters \nHis delight. \n\nSad at heart amid the splendor, \nDull to all the radiance tender, \nWhat can I for such a world give back again? \nCould I only hint the beauty\u2014 \nSome least shadow of the beauty, \nUnto men!"}
