{"subject": "Grand Old Thomas", "text": "I like my labour and the gods,\n And rave about them in the fashion\nOf those who framed their high abodes,\n And fabled them into a passion;\nAnd gave to each the task divine\n Of censor over human action;\nWith power to quell with nod or sign\n All hot dispute and knotty faction.\nI think them yet as bending still\n From their high dwelling-place in kindness,\nTo give reward for good and ill,\n Or punish man for wilful blindness.\nThis is a strange belief, I know,\n And may appear, no doubt, to some as\nUnworthy of my years; but go\n And lay the blame on 'grand old Thomas.'\nWhat right had he to come and prate\n About the gods and such digressions,\nWhen I was in that plastic state\n That keeps through lifetime such impressions?\nAnd now, when I have firmer tone,\n And less unbending in my nature,\nOf gods and faiths I babble on,\n And words of German nomenclature.\nI also deem this world should leap\n From wonder unto glowing wonder;\nThat in its rolling we should keep\n A breast with human feelings under;\nThat good should be our aim, and life\n Have more of work and God-like fearing,\nAnd less of all that paltry strife\n That keeps the dirty mud-gods sneering;\nThat cant should lift his putrid wings,\n And fly back to the primal chaos,\nAnd mix no more in human things,\n Nor with his solemn saws betray us;\nBut rot amid the dank abodes,\n Where Styx in silent blackness rushes.\nAll this came to me when the gods,\n Through 'grand old Thomas' spoke their wishes.\nI've less, too, of that iris light\n With which 'us youth' bedaubs our dreaming;\nAnd that which once was angel bright\n Is back now to a human seeming.\nI own it cost a pang or two\u2014\n Such price one pays for groping blindly\u2014\nBut when I felt my clearer view,\n I thank'd the Chelsea Teacher kindly.\nI've read your F\u00e8n\u00e8lon, but he\n Is far too polish'd to my liking;\nBut 'grand old Thomas' speaks to me\n In careless periods, rough and striking.\nA Thunder-god is he, whose brow\n Wears its word-lightning to benumb us;\nAnd so Je crains les dieux and bow,\n And love and reverence 'grand old Thomas.'"}
