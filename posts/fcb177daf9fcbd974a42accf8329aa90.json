{"subject": "From the Diary", "text": "My ear is shocked by every noise,\nMy eye - by light of sun or fire,\nMy spirit launched its cutting growth,\nLike a tooth - through gums which swelled entire.\n\nIt will break through and leave at once, \nThe former covering it sphere,\nAnd with his thousands bright eyes,\nWill rush in night - not one that's here.\n\nAnd I'll be here left and laid  - \nA banker, killed by a thug, meanest,\nTo press my wound by freezing hands,              \nTo cry and writhe in your existence.\n\nTranslated by Yevgeny Bonver, December, 2000"}
