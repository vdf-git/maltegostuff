{"subject": "Woodspring Abbey", "text": "These walls were built by men who did a deed\nOf blood:--terrific conscience, day by day,\nFollowed, where'er their shadow seemed to stay,\nAnd still in thought they saw their victim bleed,\nBefore God's altar shrieking: pangs succeed,\nAs dire upon their heart the deep sin lay,\nNo tears of agony could wash away:\nHence! to the land's remotest limit, speed!\nThese walls are raised in vain, as vainly flows\nContrition's tear: Earth, hide them, and thou, Sea,\nWhich round the lone isle, where their bones repose,\nDost sound for ever, their sad requiem be,\nIn fancy's ear, at pensive evening's close,\nStill murmuring MISERERE, DOMINE."}
