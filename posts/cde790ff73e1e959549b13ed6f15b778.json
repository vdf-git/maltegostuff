{"subject": "Sampling", "text": "I'm standing on 10th Street.\n I'm not the only one.\n Buildings rise like\n  foliage and human touch.\nAnd so shall dig this cigarette as my last,\n and rattle trains, and rot the fences\n of the gardens of my body\u2014\nor without the harmony of speaking \nhere the many sounds and rhythms that\n sound a lot like anger\nwhen anger's silent,\n like a painting, though in\n the stillness of the paint itself\n              the painter nods or waves or asks for help.\nI'm not the only one.\n The pharmacy's untitled. \nThe stars are there at night.\n              In this Humidity\nthe forlorn singing of the insects \nclings to anything nailed down. \nA whole bag of\n              things I'm working\nthrough, some set things that I know,\n like words I know that mean 'from\n              one place to another,' the word that means\n'to carry.' I'm standing still on 10th Street.\n I'm not the only one.The dark tastes of \nsalt and oranges. Its eyes\nwander round and round.\n I am its thousand windows.\n I think about the future\n              and the sea. And stay."}
