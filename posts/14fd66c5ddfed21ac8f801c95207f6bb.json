{"subject": "We Plunged Into The Western Hemisphere", "text": "We plunged into the Western Hemisphere. The chances\nare one in five I've taken a capsule of poison.\nThe air smells like flowers; I look up:\nThe music in the railway station\npresents me as a romantic understatement,\nelegant wistfulness on a visit,\ndeeply concerned with the future and electric power.\nI tried again: Do you not feel the need of some goal\nas a guide in your day-to-day decisions?\nAgain a ghastly pause like the brakes of a car,\nmiles of shoreline and countless gallons of water."}
