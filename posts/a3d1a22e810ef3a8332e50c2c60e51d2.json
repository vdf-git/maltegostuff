{"subject": "Sonnet Ii. On Robin Hood", "text": "The trees in Sherwood forest are old and good,--\nThe grass beneath them now is dimly green;\nAre they deserted all? Is no young mien\nWith loose-slung bugle met within the wood:\nNo arrow found, -- foil'd of its antler'd food,--\nStruck in the oak's rude side? Is there nought seen,\nTo mark the revelries which there have been,--\nIn the sweet days of merry Robin Hood?\n\nGo there, with Summer, and with evening,-- go\nIn the soft shadows like some wandering man,--\nAnd thou shalt far amid the forest know\nThe archer men in green, with belt and bow,\nFeasting on pheasant, river-fowl, and swan,\nWith Robin at their head, and Marian."}
