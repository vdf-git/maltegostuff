{"subject": "Friendship Broken", "text": "I\n\nWe chose the faint chill morning, friend and friend, \nPacing the twilight out beneath an oak, \nSoul calling soul to judgement; and we spoke \nStrange things and deep as any poet penned, \nSuch truth as never truth again can mend, \nWhatever arts we win, what gods invoke; \nIt was not wrath, it made nor strife nor smoke: \nBe what it may, it had a solemn end. \nFarewell, in peace. We of the selfsame throne \nAre foeman vassals; pale astrologers, \nEach a wise sceptic of the other's star. \nSilently, as we went our ways alone, \nThe steadfast sun, whom no poor prayer deters. \nDrew high between us his majestic bar. \n\nII\n\nMine was the mood that shows the dearest face \nThro' a long avenue, and voices kind \nIdle, and indeterminate, and blind \n\nAs rumors from a very distant place; \nYet, even so, it gathered the first chase \nOf the first swallows where the lane's inclined, \nAn ebb of wavy wings to serve my mind \nFor round Spring's vision. Ah, some equal grace \n(The calm sense of seen beauty without sight) \nBefell thee, honorable heart! no less \nIn patient stupor walking from the dawn; \nAlbeit thou too wert loser of life's light, \nLike fallen Adam in the wilderness, \nAware of naught but of the thing withdrawn."}
