{"subject": "Song, For A Scotch Air", "text": "O SWIFTLY glides the bonny boat\nJust parted from the shore,\nAnd, to the fisher's chorus note,\nSoft moves the dipping oar!\nHis toils are borne with lightsome cheer,\nAnd ever may they speed,\nWho feeble age and helpmates dear,\nAnd tender bairnies feed.\n\nCHORUS. \nWe cast our lines in Largo Bay,\nOur nets are floating wide,\nOur bonny boat with yielding sway\nRocks lightly on the tide;\nAnd happy prove our daily lot,\nUpon the summer sea!\nAnd blest on land our kindly cot,\nWhere all our treasures be!\nThe Mermaid on her rock may sing,\nThe Witch may weave her charm,\nNor Water-Sprite, nor eldrich thing\nThe bonny boat can harm.\nIt safely bears its scaly store\nThrough many a stormy gale,\nWhile joyful shouts rise from the shore,\nIts homeward prow to hail.\n\nCHORUS. \nWe cast our lines, &amp;c."}
