{"subject": "To Alexander Graham", "text": "Lying asleep walking \nLast night I met my father \nWho seemed pleased to see me. \nHe wanted to speak. I saw \nHis mouth saying something \nBut the dream had no sound. \nWe were surrounded by \nLaid-up paddle steamers \nIn The Old Quay in Greenock. \nI smelt the tar and the ropes. \nIt seemed that I was standing \nBeside the big iron cannon \nThe tugs used to tie up to \nWhen I was a boy. I turned \nTo see Dad standing just \nAcross the causeway under \nThat one lamp they keep on. \nHe recognised me immediately. \nI could see that. He was \nThe handsome, same age \nWith his good brows as when \nHe would take me on Sundays \nSaying we'll go for a walk. \nDad, what am I doing here? \nWhat is it I am doing now? \nAre you proud of me? \nGoing away, I knew \nYou wanted to tell me something. \nYou stopped and almost turned back \nTo say something. My father, \nI try to be the best \nIn you you give me always. \nLying asleep turning \nRound in the quay-lit dark \nIt was my father standing \nAs real as life. I smelt \nThe quay's tar and the ropes. \nI think he wanted to speak. \nBut the dream had no sound. \nI think I must have loved him."}
