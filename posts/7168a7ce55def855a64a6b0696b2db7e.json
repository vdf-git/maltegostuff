{"subject": "Crepuscule", "text": "The sunset-gonfalons are furled\nOn plains of evening, broad and pale,\nAnd woven athwart the waning world\nThe air is like a silver veil.\n\nInto the thin and trembling gloom,\nThat holds a hueless warp of light,\nThe murmuring wind on a slow loom\nWeaves the rich purples of the night."}
