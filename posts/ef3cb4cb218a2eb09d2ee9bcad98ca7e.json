{"subject": "To Dr. Wilhelm Jordan", "text": "I.\n\nJORDAN, I stand a-gaze upon the shore\nOf that deep mind of thine, and trembling hold\nMy breath the while thy p\u00e6ans glad and bold\nAbove the wild world's discord rise and soar.\nSo came the desert-wearied ones of yore,\nTo rest and breathe refreshment manifold,\nBeside thy sweet-voiced name-stream, as it rolled;\nSo paused, and quailed its sounding depths before.\n\nYes, looking down thy stream of thought, so clear,\nSo clear, yet bottomless, my mortal hand\nClips the frail growth around\u2014the first thing near\u2014\nTo stay my feet, else from that giddy stand\nMy soul could fall with one blind plunge and sheer\nQuit of thy boundless hopes and promised land!\nII.\n\nOne day, perplexed with desert wandering,\nI clomb that Pisgah of young thought, from whence\nNew prophets glass for us a scene immense\u2014\nVast beyond hope or reach of seraph's wing.\nWas it the valley mist that so did cling\nAround me, or but due to feebler sense,\nThat at the heart of splendour so intense\nI felt the void of every cherished thing?\n\nI know not, but I know that from that height\nLove, who is still a tender child and shy,\nWas taken weeping and in piteous plight\u2014\nNor ever more the place will come a-nigh\u2014\nThat he is all my business and delight,\nAnd I elect with him to live or die!"}
