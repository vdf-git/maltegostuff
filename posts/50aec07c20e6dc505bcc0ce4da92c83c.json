{"subject": "Rhapsody", "text": "No one says it \nanymore, my darling, \nnot to the green leaves \nin March, not to the stars \nbacking up each night, certainly \nnot in the nest\nof rapture, who \nin the beginning was \nan owl, rustling \njust after silence, whose \nvery presence drew \na mob of birds--flickers, \nfinches, chickadees, five cardinals \nto a tree--the way a word \nexcites its meanings. Who \ncooks for you, it calls, Who looks\nfor you? Sheaf of feathers, chief \nof bone, the owl stands \nupon the branch, but does he \nunderstand it, think my revel, \nmy banquet, my tumult, \ndelight? The Irish have a word \nfor what can't be \nreplaced: mavourneen, my \ndarling, second cousin once \nremoved of memory, what is not \nforgotten, as truth was \ndefined by the Greeks. \nIt's the names\non the stones in the cemetery \nthat ring out like rungs\non a ladder or the past \ntense of bells: Nathaniel Joy, \nElizabeth Joy, Amos \nJoy and Wilder Joy, \nand it all comes down \nto the conclusion \nof the cardinal: pretty, pretty, pretty \npretty--but pretty what? \nIn her strip search \nof scripture, St. Teresa \nwas seized, my darling, rapt \namid the chatter\nand flutter of well-coiffed \nwords, the owl \nin the shagbark hickory, \nand all the attending dangers \nlike physicians \nof the heard."}
