{"subject": "To Mary", "text": "In Bethany there dwelt a maid,\nAnd she was young and very fair;\n'Twas at her house that Jesus stayed,\nAnd loved to stay, when he was there.\n\nFor Mary seated at his feet,\nIn rapture hung upon His word:\nHis language flow'd in accent sweet,\nSuch language mortal never heard.\n\nHer sister, cross in looks and word,\n(The cares of life have this effect,)\nCame and accused her, to her Lord,\nOf idleness and of neglect.\n\n'Martha, Martha,' He kindly said,\nForego thy troubles and thy care-\nOne needful thing, a crust of bread,\nIs all I ask with thee to share.\n\n'Mary hath chosen that good part,\nTo hear my word and do my will,\nWhich shall not from her trusting heart\nBe taken.' It shall flourish still.\n\nDear Mary, in this picture see\nThy own, drawn by a master hand;\nName, face and character agree\nDrawn by Saint Luke, an artist grand."}
