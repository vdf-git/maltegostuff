{"subject": "In The Garden At Swainston", "text": "NIGHTINGALES warbled without,\nWithin was weeping for thee:\nShadows of three dead men\nWalk'd in the walks with me:\nShadows of three dead men, and thou wast one of the three.\n\nNightingales sang in the woods:\nThe Master was far away:\nNightingales warbled and sang\nOf a passion that lasts but a day;\nStill in the house in his coffin the Prince of courtesy lay.\n\nTwo dead men have I known\nIn courtesy like to thee:\nTwo dead men have I loved\nWith a love that ever will be:\nThree dead men have I loved, and thou art last of the three."}
