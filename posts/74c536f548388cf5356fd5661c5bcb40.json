{"subject": "Psalm Cxxxvii The Babylonian Captivity", "text": "ALONG the banks where Babel's current flows   \n Our captive bands in deep despondence stray'd,   \nWhile Zion's fall in sad remembrance rose,   \n Her friends, her children mingled with the dead.   \n\nThe tuneless harp, that once with joy we strung,           \n When praise employ'd and mirth inspir'd the lay,   \nIn mournful silence on the willows hung;   \n And growing grief prolong'd the tedious day.   \n\nThe barbarous tyrants, to increase the woe,   \n With taunting smiles a song of Zion claim;   \nBid sacred praise in strains melodious flow,   \n While they blaspheme the great Jehovah's name.   \n\nBut how, in heathen chains and lands unknown,   \n Shall Israel's sons a song of Zion raise?   \nO hapless Salem, God's terrestrial throne,   \n Thou land of glory, sacred mount of praise.   \n\nIf e'er my memory lose thy lovely name,   \n If my cold heart neglect my kindred race,   \nLet dire destruction seize this guilty frame;   \n My hand shall perish and my voice shall cease.   \n\nYet shall the Lord, who hears when Zion calls,   \n O'ertake her foes with terror and dismay,   \nHis arm avenge her desolated walls,   \n And raise her children to eternal day."}
