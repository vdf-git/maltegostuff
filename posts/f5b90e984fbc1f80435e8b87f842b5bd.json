{"subject": "The Kingfisher", "text": "He laughs by the summer stream\nWhere the lilies nod and dream,\nAs through the sheen of water cool and clear\nHe sees the chub and sunfish cutting sheer.\nHis are resplendent eyes;\nHis mien is kingliwise;\nAnd down the May wind rides he like a king,\nWith more than royal purple on his wing.\nHis palace is the brake\nWhere the rushes shine and shake;\nHis music is the murmur of the stream,\nAnd that leaf-rustle where the lilies dream.\nSuch life as his would be\nA more than heaven to me:\nAll sun, all bloom, all happy weather,\nAll joys bound in a sheaf together.\nNo wonder he laughs so loud!\nNo wonder he looks so proud!\nThere are great kings would give their royalty\nTo have one day of his felicity!"}
