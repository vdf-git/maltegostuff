{"subject": "Finland", "text": "Feet and faces tingle \nIn that frore land: \nLegs wobble and go wingle, \nYou scarce can stand. \n\nThe skies are jewelled all around, \nThe ploughshare snaps in the iron ground, \nThe Finn with face like paper \nAnd eyes like a lighted taper \nHurls his rough rune \nAt the wintry moon \nAnd stamps to mark the tune."}
