{"subject": "Desire", "text": "Thou, who dost dwell alone;\nThou, who dost know thine own;\nThou, to whom all are known,\nFrom the cradle to the grave,--\nSave, O, save!\n\nFrom the world's temptations;\nFrom tribulations;\nFrom that fierce anguish\nWherein we languish;\nFrom that torpor deep\nWherein we lie asleep,\nHeavy as death, cold as the grave,--\nSave, O, save!\n\nWhen the soul, growing clearer,\nSees God no nearer;\nWhen the soul, mounting higher,\nTo God comes no nigher;\nBut the arch-fiend Pride\nMounts at her side,\nFoiling her high emprize,\nSealing her eagle eyes,\nAnd, when she fain would soar,\nMake idols to adore;\nChanging the pure emotion\nOf her high devotion,\nTo a skin-deep sense\nOf her own eloquence;\nStrong to deceive, strong to enslave,--\nSave, O, save!\n\nFrom the ingrained fashion\nOf this earthly nature\nThat mars thy creature;\nFrom grief, that is but passion;\nFrom mirth, that is but feigning;\nFrom tears, that bring no healing;\nFrom wild and weak complaining;--\nThine old strength revealing,\nSave, O, save!\n\nFrom doubt, where all is doable,\nWhere wise men are not strong;\nWhere comfort turns to trouble;\nWhere just men suffer wrong;\nWhere sorrow treads on joy;\nWhere sweet things soonest cloy;\nWhere faiths are built on dust;\nWhere love is half mistrust,\nHungry, and barren, and sharp as the sea;\nO, set us free!\n\nO, let the false dream fly\nWhere our sick souls do lie,\nTossing continually.\nO, where thy voice doth come,\nLet all doubts be dumb;\nLet all words be mild;\nAll strife be reconciled;\nAll pains beguiled.\nLight brings no blindness;\nLove no unkindness;\nKnowledge no ruin;\nFear no undoing,\nFrom the cradle to the grave,--\nSave, O, save!"}
