{"subject": "Christmas Even", "text": "Alone--with one fair star for company, \nThe loveliest star among the hosts of night, \nWhile the grey tide ebbs with the ebbing light-- \nI pace along the darkening wintry sea. \nNow round the yule-log and the glittering tree \nTwinkling with festive tapers, eyes as bright \nSparkle with Christmas joys and young delight, \nAs each one gathers to his family. \n\nBut I--a waif on earth where'er I roam-- \nUprooted with life's bleeding hopes and fears \nFrom that one heart that was my heart's sole home, \nFeel the old pang pierce through the severing years, \nAnd as I think upon the years to come \nThat fair star trembles through my falling tears."}
