{"subject": "All The Way", "text": "To you I say top of the day  \nSince today is your birthday  \nWhat then can I do or say  \nOther than to thank Allah and pray  \nThat better things, come our way  Our love is like honey which does not decay  \nLike mountains which the wind blows not away  \nLike diamonds whose sparkle always stay  \nLike antiques whose worth increases everyday  \nLike rivers which flow night and day  \nAnd refreshing like the cool breeze of the bay  When things seem to be in disarray  \nMy fears you always allay  \nComforting words you always say  \nAnd you support without delay  \nRashidat, you make my day, everyday."}
