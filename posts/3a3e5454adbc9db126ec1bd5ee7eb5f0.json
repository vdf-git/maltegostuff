{"subject": "The Reasons That Induced Dr S To Write A Poem Call'D The Lady's Dressing Room", "text": "The Doctor in a clean starch'd band,\nHis Golden Snuff box in his hand,\nWith care his Di'mond Ring displays\nAnd Artfull shews its various Rays,\nWhile Grave he stalks down -- -- Street \nHis dearest Betty -- to meet.\nLong had he waited for this Hour,\nNor gain'd Admittance to the Bower,\nHad jok'd and punn'd, and swore and writ,\nTry'd all his Galantry and Wit, \nHad told her oft what part he bore\nIn Oxford's Schemes in days of yore,\nBut Bawdy, Politicks nor Satyr\nCould move this dull hard hearted Creature.\nJenny her Maid could taste a Rhyme \nAnd greiv'd to see him lose his Time,\nHad kindly whisper'd in his Ear,\nFor twice two pound you enter here,\nMy lady vows without that Summ\nIt is in vain you write or come. \nThe Destin'd Offering now he brought\nAnd in a paradise of thought\nWith a low Bow approach'd the Dame\nWho smileing heard him preach his Flame.\nHis Gold she takes (such proofes as these \nConvince most unbeleiving shees)\nAnd in her trunk rose up to lock it\n(Too wise to trust it in her pocket)\nAnd then return'd with Blushing Grace\nExpects the Doctor's warm Embrace. \nBut now this is the proper place\nWhere morals Stare me in the Face\nAnd for the sake of fine Expression\nI'm forc'd to make a small digression.\nAlas for wretched Humankind, \nWith Learning Mad, with wisdom blink!\nThe Ox thinks he's for Saddle fit\n(As long ago Freind Horace writ)\nAnd Men their Talents still mistakeing,\nThe stutterer fancys his is speaking. \nWith Admiration oft we see\nHard Features heighten'd by Toup\u00e9e,\nThe Beau affects the Politician,\nWit is the citizen's Ambition,\nPoor Pope Philosophy displays on \nWith so much Rhime and little reason,\nAnd th\u00f4 he argues ne'er so long\nThat, all is right, his Head is wrong.\nNone strive to know their proper merit\nBut strain for Wisdom, Beauty, Spirit, \nAnd lose the Praise that is their due\nWhile they've th'impossible in view.\nSo have I seen the Injudicious Heir\nTo add one Window the whole House impair.\nInstinct the Hound does better teach \nWho never undertook to preach,\nThe frighted Hare from Dogs does run\nBut not attempts to bear a Gun.\nHere many Noble thoughts occur\nBut I prolixity abhor, \nAnd will persue th'instructive Tale\nTo shew the Wise in some things fail.\nThe Reverend Lover with surprize\nPeeps in her Bubbys, and her Eyes,\nAnd kisses both, and trys--and trys. \nThe Evening in this Hellish Play,\nBeside his Guineas thrown away,\nProvok'd the Preist to that degree\nhe swore, the Fault is not in me.\nYour damn'd Close stool so near my Nose, \nYour Dirty Smock, and Stinking Toes\nWould make a Hercules as tame\nAs any Beau that you can name.\nThe nymph grown Furious roar'd by God\nThe blame lyes all in Sixty odd \nAnd scornfull pointing to the door\nCry'd, Fumbler see my Face no more.\nWith all my Heart I'll go away\nBut nothing done, I'll nothing pay.\nGive back the Money--How, cry'd she, \n\nWould you palm such a cheat on me!\nFor poor 4 pound to roar and bellow,\nWhy sure you want some new Prunella? \n\nI'll be reveng'd you saucy Quean\n(Replys the disapointed Dean)\nI'll so describe your dressing room\nThe very Irish shall not come. \nShe answer'd short, I'm glad you'l write,\nYou'l furnish paper when I shite."}
