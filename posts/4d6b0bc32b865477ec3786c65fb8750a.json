{"subject": "A Seamark", "text": "A Threnody for Robert Louis Stevenson\nCOLD, the dull cold! What ails the sun,\nAnd takes the heart out of the day?\nWhat makes the morning look so mean,\nThe Common so forlorn and gray?\n\nThe wintry city's granite heart\nBeats on in iron mockery,\nAnd like the roaming mountain rains,\nI hear the thresh of feet go by.\n\nIt is the lonely human surf\nSurging through alleys chill with grime,\nThe muttering churning ceaseless floe\nAdrift out of the North of time.\n\nFades, it all fades! I only see\nThe poster with its reds and blues\nBidding the heart stand still to take\nIts desolating stab of news.\n\nThat intimate and magic name:\n' Dead in Samoa.' . . . Cry your cries,\nO city of the golden dome,\nUnder the gray Atlantic skies!\n\nBut I have wander-biddings now.\nFar down the latitudes of sun,\nAn island mountain of the sea,\nPiercing the green and rosy zone,\n\nGoes up into the wondrous day.\nAnd there the brown-limbed island men\nAre bearing up for burial,\nWithin the sun's departing ken,\n\nThe master of the roving kind.\nAnd there where time will set no mark\nFor his irrevocable rest,\nUnder the spacious melting dark,\n\nWith all the nomad tented stars\nAbout him, they have laid him down\nAbove the crumbling of the sea,\nBeyond the turmoil of renown.\n\nO all you hearts about the world\nIn whom the truant gipsy blood,\nUnder the frost of this pale time,\nSleeps like the daring sap and flood\n\nThat dream of April and reprieve!\nYou whom the haunted vision drives,\nIncredulous of home and ease,\nPerfection's lovers all your lives!\n\nYou whom the wander-spirit loves\nTo lead by some forgotten clue\nFor ever vanishing beyond\nHorizon brinks for ever new;\n\nThe road, unmarked, ordained, whereby\nYour brothers of the field and air\nBefore you, faithful, blind, and glad,\nEmerged from chaos pair by pair;\n\nThe road whereby you too must come,\nIn the unvexed and fabled years\nInto the country of your dream,\nWith all your knowledge in arrears!\n\nYou who can never quite forget\nYour glimpse of Beauty as she passed,\nThe well-head where her knee was pressed,\nThe dew wherein her foot was cast;\n\nO you who bid the paint and clay\nBe glorious when you are dead,\nAnd fit the plangent words in rhyme\nWhere the dark secret lurks unsaid;\n\nYou brethren of the light-heart guild,\nThe mystic fellowcraft of joy,\nWho tarry for the news of truth,\nAnd listen for some vast ahoy\n\nBlown in from sea, who crowd the wharves\nWith eager eyes that wait the ship\nWhose foreign tongue may fill the world\nWith wondrous tales from lip to lip;\n\nOur restless loved adventurer,\nOn secret orders come to him,\nHas slipped his cable, cleared the reef,\nAnd melted on the white sea-rim.\n\nO granite hills, go down in blue!\nAnd like green clouds in opal calms,\nYou anchored islands of the main,\nFloat up your loom of feathery palms!\n\nFor deep within your dales, where lies\nA valiant earthling stark and dumb,\nThis savage undiscerning heart\nIs with the silent chiefs who come\n\nTo mourn their kin and bear him gifts,\u2014\nWho kiss his hand, and take their place,\nThis last night he receives his friends,\nThe journey-wonder on his face.\n\nHe 'was not born for age.' Ah no,\nFor everlasting youth is his!\nPart of the lyric of the earth\nWith spring and leaf and blade he is.\n\n'Twill nevermore be April now\nBut there will lurk a thought of him\nAt the street corners, gay with flowers\nFrom rainy valleys purple-dim.\n\nO chiefs, you do not mourn alone!\nIn that stern North where mystery broods,\nOur mother grief has many sons\nBred in those iron solitudes.\n\nIt does not help them, to have laid\nTheir coil of lightning under seas;\nThey are as impotent as you\nTo mend the loosened wrists and knees.\n\nAnd yet how many a harvest night,\nWhen the great luminous meteors flare\nAlong the trenches of the dusk,\nThe men who dwell beneath the Bear,\n\nSeeing those vagrants of the sky\nFloat through the deep beyond their hark,\nLike Arabs through the wastes of air,\u2014\nA flash, a dream, from dark to dark,\u2014\n\nMust feel the solemn large surmise:\nBy a dim, vast and perilous way\nWe sweep through undetermined time,\nIllumining this quench of clay,\n\nA moment staunched, then forth again.\nAh, not alone you climb the steep\nTo set your loving burden down\nAgainst the mighty knees of sleep.\n\nWith you we hold the sombre faith\nWhere creeds are sown like rain at sea;\nAnd leave the loveliest child of earth\nTo slumber where he longed to be.\n\nHis fathers lit the dangerous coast\nTo steer the daring merchant home;\nHis courage lights the darkling port\nWhere every sea-worn sail must come.\n\nAnd since he was the type of all\nThat strain in us which still must fare,\nThe fleeting migrant of a day,\nHeart-high, outbound for otherwhere,\n\nNow therefore, where the passing ships\nHang on the edges of the noon,\nAnd Northern liners trail their smoke\nAcross the rising yellow moon,\n\nBound for his home, with shuddering screw\nThat beats its strength out into speed,\nUntil the pacing watch descries\nOn the sea-line a scarlet seed\n\nSmoulder and kindle and set fire\nTo the dark selvedge of the night,\nThe deep blue tapestry of stars,\nThen sheet the dome in pearly light,\n\nThere in perpetual tides of day,\nWhere men may praise him and deplore,\nThe place of his lone grave shall be\nA seamark set for evermore,\n\nHigh on a peak adrift with mist,\nAnd round whose bases, far beneath\nThe snow-white wheeling tropic birds,\nThe emerald dragon breaks his teeth."}
