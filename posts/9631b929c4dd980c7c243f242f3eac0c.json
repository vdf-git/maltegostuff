{"subject": "When Mother Sleeps", "text": "When mother sleeps, a slamming door\n    Disturbs her not at all;\nA man might walk across the floor\n    Or wander through the hall\nA pistol shot outside would not\n    Drive slumber from her eyes\u2014\nBut she is always on the spot\n    The moment baby cries.\n\nThe thunder crash she would not hear,\n    Nor shouting in the street;\nA barking dog, however near,\n    Of sleep can never cheat\nDear mother, but I've noticed this\n    To my profound surprise:\nThat always wide-awake she is\n    The moment baby cries.\n\nHowever weary she may be,\n    Though wrapped in slumber deep,\nSomehow it always seems to me\n    Her vigil she will keep.\nSound sleeper that she is, I take\n    It in her heart there lies\nA love that causes her to wake\n    The moment baby cries."}
