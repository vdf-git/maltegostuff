{"subject": "I Can\u2019t Sleep -", "text": "I can\u2019t sleep. Homer, and the taut white sails.\nI could the list of ships read only to a half:\nThe long-long breed, the train of flying cranes\nHad lifted once the ancient Greece above.\n\nThe wedge of cranes to alien far frontier --\nOn heads of kings, as foam, crowns shine --\nWhere do you sail? If Helen were not here,\nWhat Troy then means for you, Achaeia\u2019s people fine?\n\nAnd Homer and the sea are moved by only love.\nWhom must I listen to? Homer is silent yet,\nAnd blackened sea with roar comes above,\nSunk in triumphant noise, head of my sleepless bed."}
