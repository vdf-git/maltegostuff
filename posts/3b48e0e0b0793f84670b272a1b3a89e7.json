M.\nThe passion and exaltation of Christ.\n\nNow let our lips with holy fear\nAnd mournful pleasure sing\nThe suff'rings of our great High Priest,\nThe sorrows of our King.\n\nHe sinks in floods of deep distress;\nHow high the waters rise!\nWhile to his heav'nly Father's ear\nHe sends perpetual cries.\n\n\"Hear me, O Lord, and save thy Son,\nNor hide thy shining face;\nWhy should thy fav'rite look like one\nForsaken of thy grace?\n\n\"With rage they persecute the man\nThat groans beneath thy wound,\nWhile for a sacrifice I pour\nMy life upon the ground.\n\n\"They tread my honor to the dust,\nAnd laugh when I complain;\nTheir sharp insulting slanders add\nFresh anguish to my pain.\n\n\"All my reproach is known to thee,\nThe scandal and the shame\nReproach has broke my bleeding heart,\nAnd lies defiled my name.\n\n\"I looked for pity, but in vain;\nMy kindred are my grief:\nI ask my friends for comfort round,\nBut meet with no relief.\n\n\"With vinegar they mock my thirst,\nThey give me gall for food;\nAnd sporting with my dying groans,\nThey triumph in my blood.\n\n\"Shine into my distressed soul,\nLet thy compassions save;\nAnd though my flesh sink down to death,\nRedeem it from the grave.\n\n\"I shall arise to praise thy name,\nShall reign in worlds unknown;\nAnd thy salvation, O my God,\nShall seat me on thy throne.\""}
