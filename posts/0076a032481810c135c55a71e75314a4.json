{"subject": "Song Of The Soul Xxii", "text": "In the depth of my soul there is \nA wordless song - a song that lives \nIn the seed of my heart. \nIt refuses to melt with ink on \nParchment; it engulfs my affection \nIn a transparent cloak and flows, \nBut not upon my lips. \nHow can I sigh it? I fear it may \nMingle with earthly ether; \nTo whom shall I sing it? It dwells \nIn the house of my soul, in fear of \nHarsh ears. \nWhen I look into my inner eyes \nI see the shadow of its shadow; \nWhen I touch my fingertips \nI feel its vibrations. \nThe deeds of my hands heed its \nPresence as a lake must reflect \nThe glittering stars; my tears \nReveal it, as bright drops of dew \nReveal the secret of a withering rose. \nIt is a song composed by contemplation, \nAnd published by silence, \nAnd shunned by clamor, \nAnd folded by truth, \nAnd repeated by dreams, \nAnd understood by love, \nAnd hidden by awakening, \nAnd sung by the soul. \nIt is the song of love; \nWhat Cain or Esau could sing it? \nIt is more fragrant than jasmine; \nWhat voice could enslave it? \nIt is heartbound, as a virgin's secret; \nWhat string could quiver it? \nWho dares unite the roar of the sea \nAnd the singing of the nightingale? \nWho dares compare the shrieking tempest \nTo the sigh of an infant? \nWho dares speak aloud the words \nIntended for the heart to speak? \nWhat human dares sing in voice \nThe song of God?"}
