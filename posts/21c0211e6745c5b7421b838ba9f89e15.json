{"subject": "The Arrow And The Song", "text": "I shot an arrow into the air,\nIt fell to earth, I knew not where; \nFor, so swiftly it flew, the sight\nCould not follow it in its flight.\n\nI breathed a song into the air,\nIt fell to earth, I knew not where; \nFor who has sight so keen and strong,\nThat it can follow the flight of song? \n\nLong, long afterward, in an oak\nI found the arrow, still unbroke; \nAnd the song, from beginning to end,\nI found again in the heart of a friend."}
