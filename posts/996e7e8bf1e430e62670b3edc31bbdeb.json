{"subject": "With A Golden Necklace", "text": "THIS page a chain to bring thee burns,\n\nThat, train'd to suppleness of old,\nOn thy fair neck to nestle, yearns,\n\nIn many a hundred little fold.\n\nTo please the silly thing consent!\n\n'Tis harmless, and from boldness free;\nBy day a trifling ornament,\n\nAt night 'tis cast aside by thee.\n\nBut if the chain they bring thee ever,\n\nHeavier, more fraught with weal or woe,\nI'd then, Lisette, reproach thee never\n\nIf thou shouldst greater scruples show."}
