{"subject": "A Thought For A Lonely Death-Bed", "text": "IF God compel thee to this destiny,\nTo die alone, with none beside thy bed\nTo ruffle round with sobs thy last word said\nAnd mark with tears the pulses ebb from thee,--\nPray then alone, ' O Christ, come tenderly !\nBy thy forsaken Sonship in the red\nDrear wine-press,--by the wilderness out-spread,--\nAnd the lone garden where thine agony\nFell bloody from thy brow,--by all of those\nPermitted desolations, comfort mine !\nNo earthly friend being near me, interpose\nNo deathly angel 'twixt my face aud thine,\nBut stoop Thyself to gather my life's rose,\nAnd smile away my mortal to Divine !
