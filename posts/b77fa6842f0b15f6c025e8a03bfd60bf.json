{"subject": "For Them, The Bitterness Of Death Is Past", "text": "For them, the bitterness of death is past ; \nFor us, we know not how our lot is cast, \nTo live or die, or worse, to suffer pain, \nThat rends and tears the body and soul atwain, \nUntil death come, a kindly friend, at last. \n\nAnd stirrings deeper yet \u2014 I have loved the earth. \nKnown sorrow that enriched the after-mirth; \nThe past was good, the future bright ; I burn \nStill, still, to see the golden years return. \nAnd plenty bear oblivion of our dearth. \n\nBut still, if hope, with each departing wing, \nShould leave me starless, night-bound, sorrowing. \nYet fate, my master, bids me follow still. \nContent, perchance : and if against my will, \nI follow on, a bound and helpless thing. \n\nTherefore I cling to hope : and yet my soul \nShall follow fate content whate'er the goal. \nSo free, though every lightsome hope be gone. \nCan rest secure upon herself alone.\nOne small firm rock whatever surges roll."}
