Below\nI see the lazy dump-carts come and go,\nCreeping like beetles and about as big.\nThe delving Paddies-\n\nPICKERING:\n\nCase of _infra dig._\n\nFITCH:\n\nLoring, light-minded and unmeaning quips\nCome with but scant propriety from lips\nFringed with the blue-black evidence of age.\n'Twere well to cultivate a style more sage,\nFor men will fancy, hearing how you pun,\nOur foulest missiles are but thrown in fun.\n\n(_Enter Dead Cat._)\n\nHere's one that thoughtfully has come to hand;\nSlant your fine eye below and see it land.\n(_Seizes Dead Cat by the tail and swings it in act to throw._)\n\nDEAD CAT (_singing_):\n\nMerrily, merrily, round I go-\nOver and under and at.\nSwing wide and free, swing high and low\nThe anti-monopoly cat!\n\nO, who wouldn't be in the place of me,\nThe anti-monopoly cat?\nDesigned to admonish,\nPersuade and astonish\nThe capitalist and-\n\nFITCH _(letting go):_\n\nScat!\n_(Exit Dead Cat.)_\nPICKERING:\n\nHuzza! good Deacon, well and truly flung!\nPat Stanford it has grassed, and Mike de Young.\nMike drives a dump-cart for the villains, though\n'Twere fitter that he pull it. Well, we owe\nThe traitor one for leaving us!-some day\nWe'll get, if not his place, his cart away.\nMeantime fling missiles-any kind will do.\n_(Enter Antique Egg.)_\nHa! we can give them an _ovation_, too!\n\nANTIQUE EGG:\n\nIn the valley of the Nile,\nWhere the Holy Crocodile\nOf immeasurable smile\nBlossoms like the early rose,\nAnd the Sacred Onion grows\nWhen the Pyramids were new\nAnd the Sphinx possessed a nose,\nBy a storkess I was laid\nIn the cool papyrus shade,\nWhere the rushes later grew,\nThat concealed the little Jew,\nBaby Mose.\n\nStraining very hard to hatch,\nI disrupted there my yolk;\nAnd I felt my yellow streaming\nThrough my white;\nAnd the dream that I was dreaming\nOf posterity was broke\nIn a night.\nThen from the papyrus-patch\nBy the rising waters rolled,\nPassing many a temple old,\nI proceeded to the sea.\nMemnon sang, one morn, to me,\nAnd I heard Cambyses sass\nThe tomb of Ozymandias!\n\nFITCH:\n\nO, venerablest orb of all the earth,\nGod rest the lady fowl that gave thee birth!\nFit missile for the vilest hand to throw\nI freely tender thee mine own. Although\nAs a bad egg I am myself no slouch,\nThy riper years thy ranker worth avouch.\nNow, Pickering, please expose your eye and say\nIf-whoop!-\n_(Exit egg.)_\nI've got the range.\n\nPICKERING:\nHooray! hooray!\nA grand good shot, and Teddy Colton's down:\nIt burst in thunderbolts upon his crown!\nLarry O'Crocker drops his pick and flies,\nAnd deafening odors scream along the skies!\nPelt 'em some more.\n\nFITCH:\n\nThere's nothing left but tar-\nwish I were a Yahoo.\n\nPICKERING:\n\nWell, you are.\nBut keep the tar. How well I recollect,\nWhen Mike was in with us-proud, strong, erect\n_Mens conscia recti_-flinging mud, he stood,\nAusterely brave, incomparably good,\nEre yet for filthy lucre he began\nTo drive a cart as Stanford's hired man,\nThat pitch-pot bearing in his hand, Old Nick\nAppeared and tarred us all with the same stick.\n_(Enter Old Nick)_.\nI hope he won't return and use his arts\nTo make us part with our immortal parts.\n\nOLD NICK:\n\nMake yourself easy on that score my lamb;\nFor both your souls I wouldn't give a damn!\nI want my tar-pot-hello! where's the stick?\n\nFITCH:\n\nDon't look at _me_ that fashion!-look at Pick.\n\nPICKERING:\n\nForgive me, father-pity my remorse!\nTruth is-Mike took that stick to spank his horse.\nIt fills my pericardium with grief\nThat I kept company with such a thief.\n\n(_Endeavoring to get his handkerchief, he opens his coat and\nthe tar-stick falls out. Nick picks it up, looks at the culprit\nreproachfully and withdraws in tears._)\n\nFITCH (_excitedly_):\n\nO Pickering, come hither to the brink-\nThere's something going on down there, I think!\nWith many an upward smile and meaning wink\nThe navvies all are running from the cut\nLike lunatics, to right and left-\n\nPICKERING:\nTut, tut-\n'Tis only some poor sport or boisterous joke.\nLet us sit down and have a quiet smoke.\n(_They sit and light cigars._)\n\nFITCH (_singing_):\n\nWhen first I met Miss Toughie\nI smoked a fine cigyar,\nAn' I was on de dummy\nAnd she was in de cyar.\n\nBOTH (_singing_):\n\nAn' I was on de dummy\nAnd she was in de cyar.\n\nFITCH (_singing_):\n\nI couldn't go to her,\nAn' she wouldn't come to me;\nAn' I was as oneasy\nAs a gander on a tree.\n\nBOTH (_singing_):\n\nAn' I was as oneasy\nAs a gander on a tree.\n\nFITCH (_singing_):\n\nBut purty soon I weakened\nAn' lef' de dummy's bench,\nAn' frew away a ten-cent weed\nTo win a five-cent wench!\n\nBOTH (_singing_)\n\nAn' frew away a ten-cent weed\nTo win a five-cent wench!\n\nFITCH:\n\nIs there not now a certain substance sold\nUnder the name of fulminate of gold,\nA high explosive, popular for blasting,\nProducing an effect immense and lasting?\n\nPICKERING:\n\nNay, that's mere superstition. Rocks are rent\nAnd excavations made by argument.\nExplosives all have had their day and season;\nThe modern engineer relies on reason.\nHe'll talk a tunnel through a mountain's flank\nAnd by fair speech cave down the tallest bank.\n\n(_The earth trembles, a deep subterranean explosion is heard and a section of the bank as big as El Capitan starts away and plunges thunderously into the cut. A part of it strikes De Young's dumpcart abaft the axletree and flings him, hurtling, skyward, a thing of legs and arms, to descend on the distant mountains, where it is cold. Fitch and Pickering pull themselves out of the debris and stand ungraveling their eyes and noses._)\n\nFITCH:\n\nWell, since I'm down here I will help to grade,\nAnd do dirt-throwing henceforth with a spade.\n\nPICKERING:\n\nGod bless my soul! it gave me quit a start.\nWell, fate is fate-I guess I'll drive this cart.  \n                        \n"}
