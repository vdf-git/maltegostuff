{"subject": "The Right Thing", "text": "Let others probe the mystery if they can.\nTime-harried prisoners of Shall and Will-\nThe right thing happens to the happy man.\n\nThe bird flies out, the bird flies back again;\nThe hill becomes the valley, and is still;\nLet others delve that mystery if they can.\n\nGod bless the roots!-Body and soul are one!\nThe small become the great, the great the small;\nThe right thing happens to the happy man.\n\nChild of the dark, he can out leap the sun,\nHis being single, and that being all:\nThe right thing happens to the happy man.\n\nOr he sits still, a solid figure when\nThe self-destructive shake the common wall;\nTakes to himself what mystery he can,\n\nAnd, praising change as the slow night comes on,\nWills what he would, surrendering his will\nTill mystery is no more: No more he can.\nThe right thing happens to the happy man."}
