{"subject": "Modern Love Xxv: You Like Not That French Novel", "text": "You like not that French novel? Tell me why. \nYou think it quite unnatural. Let us see. \nThe actors are, it seems, the usual three: \nHusband, and wife, and lover. She--but fie! \nIn England we'll not hear of it. Edmond, \nThe lover, her devout chagrin doth share; \nBlanc-mange and absinthe are his penitent fare, \nTill his pale aspect makes her over-fond: \nSo, to preclude fresh sin, he tries rosbif. \nMeantime the husband is no more abused: \nAuguste forgives her ere the tear is used. \nThen hangeth all on one tremendous IF:-- \nIf she will choose between them. She does choose; \nAnd takes her husband, like a proper wife. \nUnnatural? My dear, these things are life: \nAnd life, some think, is worthy of the Muse."}
