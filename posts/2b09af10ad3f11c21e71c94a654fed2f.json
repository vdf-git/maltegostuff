{"subject": "Miracle Fair", "text": "Commonplace miracle: \nthat so many commonplace miracles happen. \n\nAn ordinary miracle: \nin the dead of night \nthe barking of invisible dogs. \n\nOne miracle out of many: \na small, airy cloud \nyet it can block a large and heavy moon. \n\nSeveral miracles in one: \nan alder tree reflected in the water, \nand that it's backwards left to right \nand that it grows there, crown down \nand never reaches the bottom, \neven though the water is shallow. \n\nAn everyday miracle: \nwinds weak to moderate \nturning gusty in storms. \n\nFirst among equal miracles: \ncows are cows. \n\nSecond to none: \njust this orchard \nfrom just that seed. \n\nA miracle without a cape and top hat: \nscattering white doves.\n\nA miracle, for what else could you call it: \ntoday the sun rose at three-fourteen \nand will set at eight-o-one.\n\nA miracle, less surprising than it should be: \neven though the hand has fewer than six fingers, \nit still has more than four. \n\nA miracle, just take a look around: \nthe world is everywhere. \n\nAn additional miracle, as everything is additional: \nthe unthinkable \nis thinkable."}
