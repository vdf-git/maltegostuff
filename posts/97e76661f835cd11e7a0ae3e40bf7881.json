{"subject": "Songs Of The Spring Nights", "text": "I.\n\nThe flush of green that dyed the day\nHath vanished in the moon;\nFlower-scents float stronger out, and play\nAn unborn, coming tune.\n\nOne southern eve like this, the dew\nHad cooled and left the ground;\nThe moon hung half-way from the blue,\nNo disc, but conglobed round;\n\nLight-leaved acacias, by the door,\nBathed in the balmy air,\nClusters of blossomed moonlight bore,\nAnd breathed a perfume rare;\n\nGreat gold-flakes from the starry sky\nFell flashing on the deep:\nOne scent of moist earth floating by,\nAlmost it made me weep.\nII.\n\nThose gorgeous stars were not my own,\nThey made me alien go!\nThe mother o'er her head had thrown\nA veil I did not know!\n\nThe moon-blanched fields that seaward went,\nThe palm-flung, dusky shades,\nBore flowering grasses, knotted, bent,\nNo slender, spear-like blades.\n\nI longed to see the starry host\nAfar in fainter blue;\nBut plenteous grass I missed the most,\nWith daisies glimmering through.\n\nThe common things were not the same!\nI longed across the foam:\nFrom dew-damp earth that odour came-\nI knew the world my home.\nIII.\n\nThe stars are glad in gulfy space-\nFriendly the dark to them!\nFrom day's deep mine, their hiding-place,\nNight wooeth every gem.\n\nA thing for faith 'mid labour's jar,\nWhen up the day is furled,\nShines in the sky a light afar,\nMayhap a home-filled world.\n\nSometimes upon the inner sky\nWe catch a doubtful shine:\nA mote or star? A flash in the eye\nOr jewel of God's mine?\n\nA star to us, all glimmer and glance,\nMay teem with seraphim:\nA fancy to our ignorance\nMay be a truth to Him.\nIV.\n\nThe night is damp and warm and still,\nAnd soft with summer dreams;\nThe buds are bursting at their will,\nAnd shy the half moon gleams.\n\nMy soul is cool, as bathed within\nBy dews that silent weep-\nLike child that has confessed his sin,\nAnd now will go to sleep.\n\nMy body ages, form and hue;\nBut when the spring winds blow,\nMy spirit stirs and buds anew,\nYounger than long ago.\n\nLord, make me more a child, and more,\nTill Time his own end bring,\nAnd out of every winter sore\nI pass into thy spring."}
