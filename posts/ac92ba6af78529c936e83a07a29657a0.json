{"subject": "Tourists", "text": "Visits of condolence is all we get from them.\nThey squat at the Holocaust Memorial,\nThey put on grave faces at the Wailing Wall\nAnd they laugh behind heavy curtains\nIn their hotels.\nThey have their pictures taken\nTogether with our famous dead\nAt Rachel's Tomb and Herzl's Tomb\nAnd on Ammunition Hill.\nThey weep over our sweet boys\nAnd lust after our tough girls\nAnd hang up their underwear\nTo dry quickly\nIn cool, blue bathrooms."}
