{"subject": "The Spring-It Had Simply Been You", "text": "The spring-it had simply been you,\nAnd so, to a certain extent,\nThe summer; but autumn-this scandalous blue\nOf wallpaper? Rubbish and felt?\n\nThey lead an old horse to the knacker's yard.\nHis wistful, short-breathing nostrils\nAre listening: wet camomile and moss,\nOr maybe a whiff of horsemeat.\n\nImbibe with your lips and the blaze of your eyes\nThe transparent days' tear-stained vagueness,\nLike the drift of an empty bottle of scent,\nIts nostalgic lingering fragrance.\n\nTo sleep, not to argue. Despairingly\nTo sleep. Not to open the window\nWhere last summer, in frenzy, July\nWas burning and glowing like jasper,\nAnd melting the glass, and was pairing\n\nThe same crimson dragonflies,\nWhich now, on their nuptial beds,\nAre deader and more transparent\nThan crumbled dry cigarettes.\n\nHow sleepy and chilly are windows\nIn the twilight hours of frost.\nDry vitriol oil. At the bottom,\nA gnat, and expired wasps.\n\nHow draughty the north is. How ruffled\nAnd sulky\u2026 O whirlwind, drive,\nFeel, search all the crannies and hollows,\nFind me my song alive!"}
