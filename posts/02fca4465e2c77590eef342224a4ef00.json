{"subject": "Justice", "text": "I heard we were going up.\nMy feet braced themselves\nof their own accord.\nThe two men behind me grabbed\nmy upper arms, pushing me forward.\nMy feet found the steps blind.\nI struggled and was manhandled\nforced up as dead weight.\nAt the very top of the tower, I could tell\nfrom the excited voices in the depths\na distance I could only estimate but somehow\nalready knew, just as I had seen through their plans\nfrom my first step on the stone stairs.\nThey droned out the accusation.\nI deny it, I said, knowing that would get me\nnowhere, but where does it get you?\nGrant me the honour of descending on my own\nto those who stand there whooping\nlawlessly. They tightened their grip.\nBut for the law we would have beaten\nyou to death right away, said one of them.\nWe've waited years for the law\nsaid the other. Just think how things\nwould have been here otherwise.\nI am fundamentally opposed to that, I said.\nNo doubt, they laughed. That too\nis covered by the law.\n\nTranslation: 2017, David Colmer"}
