{"subject": "You'Re The Object Of My Mind", "text": "As I lay right here in my bed  \nRelaxing my body from my feet to my head  \nYou are the only thing that's on my mind  \nAnd I picture us walking in warm sunshine  \nWhile I'm in the shower I imagine us walking in the rain  \nWith plans to come inside and ease each other's pain  \nThen I get dressed and walk out the door  \nRecalling the desired object that I'm looking for  \nWhich is my lady, my companion, my queen  \nBecause together you and I make a wonderful scene  \nThen as I approach you I open up my arms  \nTo do all things good and never any harm  \nI hold on to you tight to make us both feel good  \nAnd let you know that I'll do all that I should  \nAs we walk down the street holding hands and waists  \nI think of all of the objects that I would like to taste  \nSuch as your cheeks, your neck, your lips, and your thighs  \nWell so as your plump tears from your hurtful cries  \nAs you talk to me in person or over the phone  \nThe last thing that you should ever expect to be is alone  \nWhether in person  \nOr far away  \nYou're the object of my mind  \nEvery single day"}
