{"subject": "Desolation", "text": "It seems to me that I have lived alone\u2014\nAlone, as one that liveth in a dream:\nAs light on coldest marble, or the gleam\nOf moons eternal on a land of stone,\nThe days have been to me. I have but known\nThe silence of Thulean lands extreme\u2014\nA silence all-attending and supreme\nAs is the sea's enormous monotone.\nUpon the waste no palmed mirages are,\nBut strange chimeras roam the steely light,\nAnd cold parhelia hang on hilt and scaur\nWhere flowers of frost alone have bloomed. . . . I crave\nThe friendly clasp of finite arms, to save\nMy spirit from the ravening Infinite."}
