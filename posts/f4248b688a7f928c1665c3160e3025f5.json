{"subject": "Which Shall It Be", "text": "Which shall it be? Which shall it be? \nI look'd at John-John look'd at me \n(Dear, patient John, who loves me yet \nAs well as though my locks were jet); \nAnd when I found that I must speak, \nMy voice seem'd strangely low and weak: \n''Tell me again what Robert said?'' \nAnd then I, listening, bent my head. \n''This is his letter: \n\n'''I will give \nA house and land while you shall live, \nIf, in return, from out your seven, \nOne child to me for aye is given.''' \nI look'd at John's old garments worn, \nI thought of all that John had borne \nOf poverty, and work, and care, \nWhich I, though willing, could not share; \nI thought of seven mouths to feed, \nOf seven little children's need, \nAnd then of this. \n\n''Come, John,'' said I, \n''We'll choose among them as they lie \nAsleep''; so, walking hand in hand, \nDear John and I survey'd our band. \nFirst to the cradle lightly stepp'd, \nWhere Lilian the baby slept, \nA glory 'gainst the pillow white. \nSoftly the father stooped to lay \nHis rough hand down in loving way, \nWhen dream or whisper made her stir, \nAnd huskily he said: ''Not her!'' \n\nWe stopped beside the trundle-bed \nAnd one long ray of lamp-light shed \nAthwart the boyish faces there, \nIn sleep so pitiful and fair; \nI saw on Jamie's rough, red cheek, \nA tear undried. Ere John could speak, \n''He's but a baby, too,'' said I, \nAnd kissed him as we hurried by. \n\nPale, patient Robbie's angel face \nStill in his sleep bore suffering's trace; \n''No, for a thousand crowns, not him,'' \nHe whispered, while our eyes were dim. \n\nPoor Dick! bad Dick! our wayward son, \nTurbulent, reckless, idle one- \nCould he be spared? ''Nay, He who gave, \nBade us befriend him to the grave; \nOnly a mother's heart can be \nPatient enough for such as he; \nAnd so,'' said John, ''I would not dare \nTo send him from her bedside prayer.'' \n\nThen stole we softly up above \nAnd knelt by Mary, child of love. \n''Perhaps for her 'twould better be,'' \nI said to John, Quite silently \nHe lifted up a curl that lay \nAcorss her cheek in willful way, \nAnd shook his head, ''Nay, love, not thee,'' \nThe while my heart beat audibly. \n\nOnly one more, our eldest lad, \nTrusty and truthful, good and glad- \nSo like his father. ''No, John, no- \nI can not, will not let him go.'' \n\nAnd so we wrote in courteous way, \nWe could not drive one child away, \nAnd afterward, toil lighter seemed, \nThinking of that of which we dreamed; \nHappy, in truth, that not one face \nWe missed from its accustomed place; \nThankful to work for all the seven, \nTrusting the rest to One in heaven!"}
