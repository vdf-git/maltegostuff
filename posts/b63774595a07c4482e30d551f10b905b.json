{"subject": "Venetian Epigrams I", "text": "Sarcophagi, urns, were all covered with lifelike scenes,\nfauns dancing with girls from a Bacchanalian choir,\npaired-off, goat-footed creatures puffing their cheeks,\nforcing ear-splitting notes from the blaring horns.\nCymbals and drumbeats, the marble is seen and is heard.\nHow delightful the fruit in the beaks of fluttering birds!\nNo startling noise can scare them, or scare away love,\nAmor, whose torch waves more gladly in this happy throng.\nSo fullness overcomes death, and the ashes within\nseem still, in their silent house, to feel love\u2019s delight.\nSo may the Poet\u2019s sarcophagus be adorned,\nwith this book the writer has filled with the beauty of life."}
