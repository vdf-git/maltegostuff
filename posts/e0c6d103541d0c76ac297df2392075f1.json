{"subject": "Longing (Of A Wife)", "text": "The day I said \u201cI do\u201d\nI vowed my life to you, \nAll my hopes and dreams\nMy fears and needs\nMelted into one with yours\nWe were two no more.\n\nAnd then my life as married wife\nStarted with a roar of chores\nWith pets to feed, lunches every day\nDishes, washing, baths and more\nYou beside me, all the way.\nYet your kisses is what I missed\n\nAnd slowly passion is replaced\nWith tired bodies, late at night\nQuick hello\u2019s and quick goodbyes\nA hug, a kiss, a longing look\nAnother load outside to dry.\nMy soul amiss your sweet caress\n\nWaking up again this morning\nNext to you on our warm bed\nYou on your side, me on mine\nThe winter cold our coverlet\nYour body close, and yet so far\nPining for your warmth, your touch.\n\nOh how I long for just an hour\nNot a minute before dinner\nLike rushing through another chore\nNot just moments, but a loving spell\nTo slowly let our love burn through\nthe build up of our wanting passion\n\nTo strip away the masks we wear\nAs mother, father, employee\nAnd bare ourselves, care free\nfrom obligations and necessities\nTo love and want and hunger\nFor an hour, just each other."}
