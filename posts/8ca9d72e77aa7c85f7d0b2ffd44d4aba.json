{"subject": "With The Light Of My Eyes As An Ofering", "text": "With the light of my eyes as an ofering,\nI'll prostrate myself at my beloved's feet,\nAnd pour out my heart to him\n\nO spring breeze ! I'd like to ask:\nYou brought full bloom to dried up lakes;\nHow could you forget my scalded heart ?\n\nThe flaming fire of love burns up\nImpure lusts of the flesh, and the lover\nIs free from the fetters of desire.\n\nHe played me false at the weir,\nLeaving me floating in the middle of the river -\nA trapped and helpless scapegoat.\n\nIn a lovely boat - he's so fond of tours ! -\nI'll take him to the Ahrabal fair,\nWith my cups brimming over with love.\n\nI'll show him the Yusmarg meadows,\nSpread a velvet carpet under his feet,\nAnd make the larks of Nilanag sing for him.\n\nCascading tears from my eyes\nWill put Nishat and Ahrabal into the shade !\nWhat else do I have to boast of ?\n\nOn the banks of the Hakura stream,\nAt Sangarwan or Nagabal,\nI'll gaze at him from the heights.\n\nWith shehnais playing down the bank of the Sindh,\nI'll steer my boat to Manasbal,\nWhere I'll remind him of his pledge.\n\nHe leaves me perplexed - which he always does\nTo put the blame on me ! - Is he now in retreat,\nEnjoying~the breezes at Chadura spring ?\n\nShould my love come to rest under Mahjoor's chinars\nWith the soft breeze blowing from the Arigam stream,\nI'll spread jessamine under his feet !"}
