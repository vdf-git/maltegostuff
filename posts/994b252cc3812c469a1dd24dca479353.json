{"subject": "Sonnet To Mrs. Jameson,", "text": "WHO WROTE UNDER MY LIKENESS AS JULIET, 'LIETI GIORNI E FELICE.'\nWhence should they come, lady! those happy days\nThat thy fair hand and gentle heart invoke\nUpon my head? Alas! such do not rise\nOn any, of the many, who with sighs\nBear through this journey-land of woe, life's yoke.\nThe light of such lives not in thine own lays;\nSuch were not hers, that girl, so fond, so fair,\nBeneath whose image thou hast traced thy prayer.\nEvil, and few, upon this darksome earth,\nMust be the days of all of mortal birth;\nThen why not mine? Sweet lady! wish again,\nNot more of joy to me, but less of pain;\nCalm slumber, when life's troubled hours are past,\nAnd with thy friendship cheer them while they last."}
