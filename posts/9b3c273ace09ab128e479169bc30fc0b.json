{"subject": "The Birthday Of Washington", "text": "REMEMBERING him we praise to-day, \nHushed is the mighty roar of trade, \nAnd pausing on its ardent way, \nA nation's homage here is paid. \n\nUpon the great Virginian's grave \nLook down the new-born century's eyes, \nWhere by his loved Potomac wave \nIn God's long rest His soldier lies. \n\nA hundred years have naught revealed! \nTo blot this manhood's record high, \n'That blazoned duty's stainless shield \nAnd set a star in honor's sky.' \n\nIn self-approval firm, his life \nSerenely passed through darkest days; \nIn calm or storm, in peace or strife, \nUnmoved by blame, unstirred by praise. \n\nNo warrior pride disturbed his peace, \nNor place nor gain. He loved his fields, \nHis home, the chase, his land's increase, \nThe simple life that nature yields. \n\nAnd yet for us all man could give \nHe gave, with that which never dies, \nThe gift through which great nations live, \nThe lifelong gift of sacrifice. \n\nWith true humility he learned \nThe game of war, the art of rule; \nAnd, calmly patient, slowly earned \nHis competence in life's large school. \n\nWell may we honor him who sought \nTo live with one unfailing aim, \nAnd found at last, unasked, unsought, \nIn duty's path, the jewel, fame! \n\nAnd He who girded him with power, \nAnd gave him strength to do the right, \nWill ask of us, in some stern hour, \n'How have ye used the gift of might?' \n\nSince, till this harried earth shall gain \nThe heaven of Thy peace, O Lord! \nFreedom and Law will need to reign \nBeneath the shadow of the sword."}
