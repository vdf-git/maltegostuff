{"subject": "Flower And Fruit", "text": "THE flower you placed within my button-hole\nHas faded; but there lives within my soul\nAnother rose, unfolding hour by hour\u2014\nYour beauty's self in its immortal flower.\n\nSo living-warm this dainty blossom blows,\nAs if a sunbeam blushed into a Rose,\nTo make me rich with its ungathered wealth,\nAnd happy in the glory of its health;\n\nWith fragrance like a waft from heaven afar,\nAnd look as lustrous as the morning star.\nI do not come to crown your beauty, Sweet!\nNor thank you for it, kneeling at your feet;\n\nBut pray that on Love's bosom it may rest,\nAs thornless as its likeness in my breast;\nAnd ask Him who such promise here hath given\nTo let me see the Flower fulfilled in heaven."}
