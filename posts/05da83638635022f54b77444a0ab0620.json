{"subject": "Adoption", "text": "Because I was a woman lone\n      And had of friends so few,\nI made two little ones my own,\n      Whose parents no one knew;\nUnwanted foundlings of the night,\n      Left at the convent door,\nWhose tiny hands in piteous plight\n                  Seemed to implore.\n\nBy Deed to them I gave my name,\n      And never will they know\nThat from the evil slums they came,\n      Two waifs of want and woe;\nI fostered them with love and care\n      As if they were my own:\nNow John, my son, is tall and fair,\n                  And dark is Joan.\n\nMy boy's a member of the Bar,\n      My girl a nurse serene;\nYet when I think of what they are\n      And what they might have been,\nWith shuddering I glimpse a hell\n      Of black and bitter fruit . . .\nWhere John might be a criminal,\n                  And Joan--a prostitute."}
