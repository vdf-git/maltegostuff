{"subject": "Preparatory Meditations - First Series: 6.", "text": "(Canticles 2:1. The Lily of the Valleys)\n\nAm I Thy gold? Or purse, Lord, for Thy wealth;\nWhether in mine or mint refined for Thee?\nI'm counted so, but count me o'er Thyself,\nLest gold-washed face, and brass in heart I be.\nI fear my touchstone touches when I try\nMe, and my counted gold too overly.\n\nAm I new-minted by Thy stamp indeed?\nMine eyes are dim; I cannot clearly see.\nBe Thou my spectacles that I may read\nThine image do upon me stand,\nI am a golden angel in Thy hand.\n\nLord, make my soul Thy plate: Thine image bright\nWithin the circle of the same enfoil.\nAnd on its brims in golden letters write\nThy superscription in an holy style.\nThen I shall be Thy money, Thou my hoard:\nLet me Thy angel be, be Thou my Lord."}
