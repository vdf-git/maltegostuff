{"subject": "A Dream", "text": "Most ovious things occur among us\nAlmost everyday, every second\nWe certainly go on doing our works-everytime\nNone of our  business whether soneone is dying\nSomeone is hungry besides our apartment's slum\nCraving for just one mosel of food from anywhere\nJust none of our business-naah-never, we don't bother\nBut my dear friend, \nThere would also be a mother like among us\nWho is praying for the food to his small children\nWho too bothers that his husband might be working\nTo just provide the square mill to his family\nIn whose eyes there would be dreams of  gold and silver\nBut that dream always rests there, for forever\nDays go on passing providing them dissapointment\nAnd the  eyes that have  dreams of gold and silver\nSomwhere, are closed for forever"}
