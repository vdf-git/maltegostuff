{"subject": "The Choice", "text": "This Consul Casement\u2014he who heard the cry\nOf stricken people\u2014and who in his fight\nTo lift the torture load from broken men,\nAnd shield sad women from eternal night,\nWent through lone, hot, and fevered foreign lands.\nFor doom\u00e8d Casement, slaves that he raised up\nPray with strong voices, so a wide world hears.\nMen saved from anguish, women saved from shame,\nHe dried your children's tears!\nHe gave you life\u2014for him lift pleading hands.\nSir Roger Casement, honoured for his years\nOf stress and struggle, of fatigue and work,\nWhat is the claim of his frail human needs\n\nFor arduous hours he did not shun nor shirk,\nA King's reward, a royal friendliness!\nFor honoured Casement titles and renown,\nA future great with promise, all life's page\nWrit in gold letters, and a path so soft\nOne could not hear the coming of old age\nTo point an honoured tomb that nations bless.\nAh! Irish Casement, in the roar of war\nThat stung his blood and whipped his manhood's fire.\nWhat did he hear upon red shaken earth,\nWhere little nations struggle and expire?\nSome banshee cry upon the hot wind thrills!\nAnd Roger Casement\u2014he who freed the slave,\nMade sad babes smile and tortured women hope, \nFlung all aside, King's honours and great years,\nTo take for finis here a hempen rope,\nAnd banshee cries upon far Irish hills."}
