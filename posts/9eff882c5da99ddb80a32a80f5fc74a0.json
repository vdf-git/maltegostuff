{"subject": "Antarctic", "text": "What tale is this which stirs a world of knaves\nOut of its grubbing to throw greasy pence\nForth to the hat, and choke with eloquence\nIn boastful prose and verse of doubtful staves?\nFour men have died, gentlemen, heroes, braves;\nSnows wrap them round eternally. From thence\nThey may no more return to life or sense\nAnd a steel moon aches down on their chill graves.\n\n'They died for England.' It is excellent\nTo die for England. Death is oft the prize\nOf him who bears the burden and the load.\nSo with a glory let our lives be spent --\nWe may be noble in the Minories\nAnd die for England in the Camden Road."}
