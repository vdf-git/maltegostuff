{"subject": "Radio", "text": "'\u2014science per se\u2014' \nmy God, when I hear them on the radio saying that, \nit slays me. \nIs there a science that's not per se? \nI don't get out much, rarely get to see any lakes, \ngardens only sporadically and then behind fences, \nor in allotments, that's about the size of it, \nI rely on ersatz: \nradio, newspaper, magazines\u2014 \nso how can people say such things to me? \n\nIt makes you wonder \nwhether there are any surrogates for hollyhocks, \nfor warm life, French kisses, hanky-panky, \nall those things that make existence a little luxurious, \nand all of them somehow of a piece! \n\nNo, all this cerebration is not my cup of tea, \nbut there are sometimes hours on end \nwhere there's no woman on any wavelength \n(I receive medium-wave, short-, long-, and VHF), \nno voice saying, 'first you say no, then \n                                                                              maybe, then yes,' \nnothing but these opinionated pedagogues, \nit seems that everything the West thinks of as its \nhigher product is produced by the seated male\u2014 \nas I say, give me the hanky-panky any day! \nII\n'\u2014the last vestiges of the ancient culture would have completely disappeared\u2014' \n(well, and what if) \n'\u2014a sonorous past\u2014' \n(la-di-dah) \n'\u2014in villages in New Mexico \nfarmers still bless their fields and livestock \nwith these songs\u2014' \n(very nice, I'm sure, \nbut I don't get out of Brandenburg much). \n\nWe hear Professor Salem Aleikum, \nthe reporter still slavering over him: \n'the professor is lying on the porch of his house \nwith his lute cradled in his arm \nsinging the old ballads'\u2014 \nprobably on an ottoman, \nwith a carafe of ice water at his side, \nrejecting old hypotheses, putting out new ones\u2014 \n\nthe great rivers of the world \nthe Nile, the Brahmaputra, or what the hell do I know \nwouldn't be enough to drown all those professors\u2014 \n\ndon't have any acreage, don't have any livestock, \nnothing blesses me, life is one continuous affliction, \nbut nothing like those professors \nteach, teach, teach, \nfrom every pore, \nwho turn everything into illustrated lecture (with slides)."}
