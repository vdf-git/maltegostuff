{"subject": "THE ALIBI", "text": "My mind was racing.\nIt was some years from now.\nWe were together again in our old flat.\nYou were admiring yourself adjusting your hat.\n\u2018Oh of course I was mad then,' you said with a forgiving smile,\n\u2018Something snapped in me and I was mad for a while.'\n\nBut this madness of yours disgusted me,\nThis alibi,\nThis gorgeous madness like a tinkling sleigh,\nIt carried you away\nSnug in your fur, snug in your muff and cape.\nYou made your escape\nThrough the night, over the dry powdery snow.\nI watched you go.\n\n                                   \t***\n\nTruly the mad deserve our sympathy.\nAnd you were driven mad you said by me.\n\nAnd then you drove away,\nThe cushions and the furs piled high,\nSnug with your madness alibi,\nInjured and forgiven on your loaded sleigh."}
