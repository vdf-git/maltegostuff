{"subject": "The Fool's Epilogue", "text": "MANY good works I've done and ended,\nYe take the praise--I'm not offended;\nFor in the world, I've always thought\nEach thing its true position hath sought.\nWhen praised for foolish deeds am I,\nI set off laughing heartily;\nWhen blamed for doing something good,\nI take it in an easy mood.\nIf some one stronger gives me hard blows,\nThat it's a jest, I feign to suppose:\nBut if 'tis one that's but my own like,\nI know the way such folks to strike.\nWhen Fortune smiles, I merry grow,\nAnd sing in dulci jubilo;\nWhen sinks her wheel, and tumbles me o'er,\nI think 'tis sure to rise once more.\n\nIn the sunshine of summer I ne'er lament,\nBecause the winter it cannot prevent;\nAnd when the white snow-flakes fall around,\nI don my skates, and am off with a bound.\nThough I dissemble as I will,\nThe sun for me will ne'er stand still;\nThe old and wonted course is run,\nUntil the whole of life is done;\nEach day the servant like the lord,\nIn turns comes home, and goes abroad;\nIf proud or humble the line they take,\nThey all must eat, drink, sleep, and wake.\nSo nothing ever vexes me;\nAct like the fool, and wise ye'll be!"}
