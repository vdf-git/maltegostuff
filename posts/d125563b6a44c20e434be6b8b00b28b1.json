{"subject": "On The Zodiac", "text": "Behold our orbit as through twice six signs\nOur central Sun apparently inclines:\nThe Golden Fleece his pale ray first adorns,\nThen tow'rds the Bull he winds and gilds his horns;\nCastor and Pollux then receive his ray;\nOn burning Cancer then he seems to stay;\nOn flaming Leo pours the liquid shower;\nThen faints beneath the Virgin's conquering power:\nNow the just Scales weigh well both day and night;\nThe Scorpion then receives the solar light;\nThen quivered Chiron clouds his wintry face,\nAnd the tempestuous Sea-Goat mends his pace;\nNow in the water Sol's warm beams are quench'd,\nTill with the Fishes he is fairly drench'd.\nThese twice six signs successively appear,\nAnd mark the twelve months of the circling year."}
