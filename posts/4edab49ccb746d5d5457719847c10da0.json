{"subject": "Bki:Ii To Augustus", "text": "The Father\u2019s sent enough dread hail\nand snow to earth already, striking\nsacred hills with fiery hand,\nto scare the city,\n\nand scare the people, lest again\nwe know Pyrrha\u2019s age of pain\nwhen Proteus his sea-herds drove\nacross high mountains,\n\nand fishes lodged in all the elms,\nthat used to be the haunt of doves,\nand the trembling roe-deer swam\nthe whelming waters.\n\nWe saw the yellow Tiber\u2019s waves\nhurled backwards from the Tuscan shore,\ntoppling Numa\u2019s Regia and\nthe shrine of Vesta,\n\nfar too fierce now, the fond river,\nin his revenge of wronged Ilia,\ndrowning the whole left bank, deep,\nwithout permission.\n\nOur children, fewer for their father\u2019s\nvices, will hear metal sharpened\nthat\u2019s better destined for the Persians,\nand of battles too.\n\nWhich gods shall the people call on\nwhen the Empire falls in ruins?\nWith what prayer shall the virgins\ntire heedless Vesta?\nWhom will Jupiter assign to\nexpiate our sins? We pray you,\ncome, cloud veiling your bright shoulders,\nfar-sighted Apollo:\n\nor laughing Venus Erycina,\nif you will, whom Cupid circles,\nor you, if you see your children\nneglected, Leader,\n\nyou sated from the long campaign,\nwho love the war-shouts and the helmets,\nand the Moor\u2019s cruel face among his\nblood-stained enemies.\n\nOr you, winged son of kindly Maia,\nchanging shape on earth to human\nform, and ready to be named as\nCaesar\u2019s avenger: \n\nDon\u2019t rush back to the sky, stay long\namong the people of Quirinus,\nno swifter breeze take you away,\nunhappy with our\n\nsins: here to delight in triumphs,\nin being called our prince and father,\nmaking sure the Medes are punished,\nlead us, O Caesar."}
