{"subject": "Australia", "text": "WHAT can we give in return   \nFor her beauty and mystery   \n Of flowering forest, infinite plain,   \n Deep sky and distant mountain-chain,   \nAnd her triumphant sea,           \nThundering old songs of liberty?   \n\nLove\u2014steadfast as her stars,   \nAnd passionate as her sun,   \n And joyous as the winds, that fling   \n The golden petals of her spring           \nBy gully, spur, and run,   \nOn dreaming age, and little one:   \n\nCourage\u2014when courage fails   \nIn the blind smoke and pain   \n Of raging fire, and lurid sky,           \n And dumb thirst-driven agony\u2014   \nTill river and creek again   \nSwirl seaward through the teeming rain.   \n\nFaith\u2014wild flower of the soul,   \nThrilling the breathless night           \n With fragrance, and the desolate ways   \n Where silence fears to whisper praise,   \nWith radiant delight   \nOf wonder\u2014worship in God\u2019s sight.   \n\nDuty\u2014O great white stars,           \nAnd glorious red cross, shine   \n On victory, when, rushing forth   \n Against the peril of the North,   \nAustralia\u2019s battle-line   \nFlings out Trafalgar\u2019s deathless sign."}
