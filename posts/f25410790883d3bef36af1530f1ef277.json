{"subject": "Hymn 99", "text": "Stones made children of Abraham.\n\nMatt. 3:9. \n\nVain are the hopes that rebels place\nUpon their birth and blood,\nDescended from a pious race;\nTheir fathers now with God.\n\nHe from the caves of earth and hell\nCan take the hardest stones,\nAnd fill the house of Abram well\nWith new-created sons.\n\nSuch wondrous power doth he possess\nWho formed our mortal frame,\nWho called the world from emptiness,\nThe world obeyed and came."}
