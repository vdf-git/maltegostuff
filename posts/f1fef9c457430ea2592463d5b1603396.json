{"subject": "A Letter Home", "text": "(To Robert Graves) \n\nI \n\nHere I'm sitting in the gloom \nOf my quiet attic room. \nFrance goes rolling all around, \nFledged with forest May has crowned. \nAnd I puff my pipe, calm-hearted, \nThinking how the fighting started, \nWondering when we'll ever end it, \nBack to hell with Kaiser sent it, \nGag the noise, pack up and go, \nClockwork soldiers in a row. \nI've got better things to do \nThan to waste my time on you. \n\nII \n\nRobert, when I drowse to-night, \nSkirting lawns of sleep to chase \nShifting dreams in mazy light, \nSomewhere then I'll see your face \nTurning back to bid me follow \nWhere I wag my arms and hollo, \nOver hedges hasting after \nCrooked smile and baffling laughter, \nRunning tireless, floating, leaping, \nDown your web-hung woods and valleys, \nWhere the glowworm stars are peeping, \nTill I find you, quiet as stone \nOn a hill-top all alone, \nStaring outward, gravely pondering \nJumbled leagues of hillock-wandering. \n\nIII \n\nYou and I have walked together \nIn the starving winter weather. \nWe've been glad because we knew \nTime's too short and friends are few. \nWe've been sad because we missed \nOne whose yellow head was kissed \nBy the gods, who thought about him \nTill they couldn't do without him. \nNow he's here again; I've been \nSoldier David dressed in green, \nStanding in a wood that swings \nTo the madrigal he sings. \nHe's come back, all mirth and glory, \nLike the prince in a fairy tory. \nWinter called him far away; \nBlossoms bring him home with May. \n\nIV \n\nWell, I know you'll swear it's true \nThat you found him decked in blue \nStriding up through morning-land \nWith a cloud on either hand. \nOut in Wales, you'll say, he marches \nArm-in-arm with aoks and larches; \nHides all night in hilly nooks, \nLaughs at dawn in tumbling brooks. \nYet, it's certain, here he teaches \nOutpost-schemes to groups of beeches. \nAnd I'm sure, as here I stand, \nThat he shines through every land, \nThat he sings in every place \nWhere we're thinking of his face. \n\nV \n\nRobert, there's a war in France; \nEverywhere men bang and blunder, \nSweat and swear and worship Chance, \nCreep and blink through cannon thunder. \nRifles crack and bullets flick, \nSing and hum like hornet-swarms. \nBones are smashed and buried quick. \nYet, through stunning battle storms, \nAll the while I watch the spark \nLit to guide me; for I know \nDreams will triumph, though the dark \nScowls above me where I go. \nYou can hear me; you can mingle \nRadiant folly with my jingle. \nWar's a joke for me and you \nWhile we know such dreams are true!"}
