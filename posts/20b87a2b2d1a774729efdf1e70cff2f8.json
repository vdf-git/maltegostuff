{"subject": "Song: Go And Catch A Falling Star", "text": "Go and catch a falling star,\n       Get with child a mandrake root,\n   Tell me where all past years are,\n       Or who cleft the devil's foot,\n   Teach me to hear mermaids singing,\n   Or to keep off envy's stinging,\n          And find\n          What wind\n   Serves to advance an honest mind.\n\n  If thou be'st born to strange sights,\n      Things invisible to see,\n  Ride ten thousand days and nights,\n      Till age snow white hairs on thee,\n  Thou, when thou return'st, wilt tell me,\n  All strange wonders that befell thee,\n         And swear,\n         No where\n  Lives a woman true, and fair.\n\n  If thou find'st one, let me know,\n      Such a pilgrimage were sweet;\n  Yet do not, I would not go,\n      Though at next door we might meet;\n  Though she were true, when you met her,\n  And last, till you write your letter,\n         Yet she\n         Will be\n  False, ere I come, to two, or three."}
