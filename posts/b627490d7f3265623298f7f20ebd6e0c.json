{"subject": "Ball's Bluff: A Reverie", "text": "One noonday, at my window in the town,\nI saw a sight - saddest that eyes can see -\nYoung soldiers marching lustily\nUnto the wars,\nWith fifes, and flags in mottoed pageantry;\nWhile all the porches, walks, and doors\nWere rich with ladies cheering royally.\n\nThey moved like Juny morning on the wave,\nTheir hearts were fresh as clover in its prime\n(It was the breezy summer time),\nLife throbbed so strong,\nHow should they dream that Death in rosy clime\nWould come to thin their shining throng?\nYouth feels immortal, like the gods sublime.\n\nWeeks passed; and at my window, leaving bed,\nBy nights I mused, of easeful sleep bereft,\nOn those brave boys (Ah War! thy theft);\nSome marching feet\nFound pause at last by cliffs Potomac cleft;\nWakeful I mused, while in the street\nFar footfalls died away till none were left."}
