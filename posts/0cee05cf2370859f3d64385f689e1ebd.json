{"subject": "Story Of An Ex-Marine", "text": "In the dead of night, you hear a scream,\n Could it be that ex-marine?\n The one from Adak, the one with pain,\n The one who came back home again?\n The one who was all alone, is it his\n screams which chills our bones?\n The ex-marine, who's country he proudly\n served,\n The one who never lost his nerve.\n While soldiers fought, and sailors sailed,\n Upon Adak he went through hell.\n Although he left home a boy, he returned \n a man,\n For him nothing could be the same again.\n When he returned in his face, the pain\n you could see,\n Yes, this is the story of an ex-marine\n ."}
