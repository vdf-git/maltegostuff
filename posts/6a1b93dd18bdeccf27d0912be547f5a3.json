{"subject": "To Emilia Lovatelli,", "text": "WEEPING BY SHELLEY'S GRAVE IN THE PROTESTANT CEMETERY OF ROME.\nLur'd by the Siren's summer song to death,\nThe Poet fell asleep\u2014and the fine frame,\nShrine of the finer soul, on wings of flame,\nWas borne into the air; but underneath\nThis sacred soil his heart has found a home;\nThy light feet cannot stir its marble sleep,\nNor e'en thy gracious pity wake again\nOne throbbing pulse of pleasure or of pain.\nO noblest daughter of Imperial Rome,\nWho by our Poet's grave hast paus'd to weep,\nThe after-glow of fame warms not his tomb,\nWhose laurels only make its gloom more deep;\nBut the sweet violet wreath his dead heart wears,\nFragrant and fresh, was sown there by thy tears."}
