{"subject": "Written After Reading King Lear", "text": "Long is his course, O master of our woes. \nAnd joys, and tears, oiu' passions and desires, \nIn nature's school \u2014 in helL begotten fires ; \nDread is the agony and fell the throes \nWhich with the Night and Storm he undergoes, \nWhile Treason in his robes herself attires, \nAnd Love beneath adultery's sheet expires, \nAnd mocked Sincerity sincerer grows. \nTo vie with wailing winds and weeping clouds \nAnd valleys shrieking in the fangs of storms. \nThis Human hurricane thou didst create ; \nBut just as soon as Death this horror shrouds, \nI hear the distant cry of fiery forms, \nAv, and the creaking of hell's deepest gate."}
