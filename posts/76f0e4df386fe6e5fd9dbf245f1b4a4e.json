{"subject": "Maid Of Cambria", "text": "Maid of Cambria do not blame\nI'he look of love thou see'st in me ;\nNor turn away thine eyes of flame,\nAs if I err'd to look on thee.\nIf such were error, then could I,\nStill gazing on thy beaming eye.\nIn error live\u2014in error die.\n\nCambrian maiden, smooth thy brow\u2014\nThe love my heart to thee would give\nIs such as Angels do bestow :\nAn Angel blameless might receive\nTrue as the faith, the Cimbri plight.\nFirm as the vow they never slight,\nAnd worthy loveliness so bright.\nTo-day old ocean's sullen roar\nBore me to the Cambrian shore ;\nTo- morrow will the morning ray\nCall me from these shores away.\nWhy should it pain thee then to see,\nWhen thy bright eye is turned on me,\nI wish I'd worlds to offer thee."}
