{"subject": "Stonewall Jackson", "text": "Mortally Wounded at Chancellorsville\n\nThe Man who fiercest charged in fight,\nWhose sword and prayer were long -\nStonewall!\nEven him who stoutly stood for Wrong,\nHow can we praise? Yet coming days\nShall not forget him with this song.\n\nDead is the Man whose Cause is dead, \nVainly he died and set his seal -\nStonewall!\nEarnest in error, as we feel;\nTrue to the thing he deemed was due,\nTrue as John Brown or steel.\n\nRelentlessly he routed us;\nBut we relent, for he is low -\nStonewall!\nJustly his fame we outlaw; so\nWe drop a tear on the bold Virginian's bier,\nBecause no wreath we owe."}
