{"subject": "Dantis Tenebrae (In Memory Of My Father)", "text": "AND didst thou know indeed, when at the font\nTogether with thy name thou gav'st me his,\nThat also on thy son must Beatrice\nDecline her eyes according to her wont,\nAccepting me to be of those that haunt\nThe vale of magical dark mysteries\nWhere to the hills her poet's foot-track lies,\nAnd wisdom's living fountain to his chaunt\nTrembles in music? This is that steep land\nWhere he that holds his journey stands at gaze\nTow'rd sunset, when the clouds like a new height\nSeem piled to climb. These things I understand:\nFor here, where day still soothes my lifted face,\nOn thy bowed head, my father, fell the night."}
