{"subject": "Requiem For The New Year", "text": "On this first dark day of the year\n      my daddy was born lo\nthese eighty-six years ago who now\n      has not drawn breath or held\nbodily mass for some ten years and still   \n      I have not got used to it.\nMy mind can still form to that chair him   \n      whom no chair holds.\nEach year on this night on the brink\n      of new circumference I stand and gaze\ntowards him, while roads careen with drunks,   \n      and my dad who drank himself\naway cannot be found. Daddy, I'm halfway   \n      to death myself. The millenium\nhurtles towards me, and the boy I bore   \n      who bears your fire in his limbs\nfollows in my wake. Why can you not be   \n      reborn all tall to me? If I raise my arms\nhere in the blind dark, why can you not   \n      reach down now to hoist me up?\nThis heavy carcass I derive from yours is   \n      tutelage of love, and yet each year\nthough older another notch I still cannot stand   \n      to reach you, or to emigrate\nfrom the monolithic shadow you left."}
