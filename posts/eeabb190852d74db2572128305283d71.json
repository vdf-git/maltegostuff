{"subject": "A Servian Song", "text": "Wherefore neighest thou so sadly?\nStampest with the hoof so madly?\nSpeak my steed\u2014why at the tent\nWith thy stately neck down bent?\n\nHave not my own hands caress\u2019d thee?\nProudly in gay trappings dress\u2019d thee?\nYet thou com\u2019st not as of old,\nChamping at thy curb of gold.\n\nHast thou not, in bright hues glowing,\nSilken shabrack downward flowing,\nSilver hoof and broidered rein.\nGemm\u2019d with trophies from the slain?\n\nAnd the horse, he answered sadly\nStamp I with the hoof so madly?\nTramp of steed I hear afar,\nTrumpet clang and din of war.\n\nBut soon a stranger will bestride me,\nOther hand than thine will guide me,\nNever more by thee caress\u2019d,\nOr proudly in gay trappings dress\u2019d.\n\nSee, the foe, with fury glowing,\nRends my glittering shabrack flowing,\nCurb of gold and broidered rein\nFiercely does he cleave in twain.\n\nAnd my stately neck is drooping,\n\u2019Neath a fearful burthen stooping\nThere a dead man lies supine,\nCold as ice\u2014the Form is thine!"}
