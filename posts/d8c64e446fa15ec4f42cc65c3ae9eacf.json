{"subject": "Tan Tien", "text": "As usual, the first gate was modest. It is dilapidated. She can't tell\nwhich bridge crossed the moat, which all cross sand now, disordered with footsteps.\nIt's a precise overlay of circles on squares, but she has trouble locating\nthe main avenue and retraces her steps in intense heat for the correct entrance,\nwhich was intentionally blurred, the  way a round arch can give onto a red wall,\nfar enough in back of the arch for sun to light.\n\nIf being by yourself separates from your symmetry, which is\nthe axis of your spine in the concrete sense, but becomes a suspension\nin your spine like a layer of sand under the paving stones of a courtyard\nor on a plain, you have to humbly seek out a person who can listen to you,\non a street crowded with bicycles at night, their bells ringing.\n\nAnd any stick or straight line you hold can be your spine,\nlike a map she is following in French of Tan Tien. She wants space to fall\nto each side of her like traction, not weight dispersed within a mirror. At any time,\nan echo of what she says will multiply against the walls in balanced,\ndizzying jumps like a gyroscope in the heat, but she is alone.\n\nLater, she would remember herself as a carved figure and its shadow on a blank board,\nbut she is her balancing stick, and the ground to each side of her is its length,\ndisordered once by an armored car, and once by an urn of flowers at a crossing.\nThe stick isn't really the temple's bisection around her, like solstice or ancestor.\nThis Tang Dynasty peach tree would be parallel levitation in the spine\nthe person recording it.\n\nSlowly the hall looms up. The red stair's outline gives way to its duration\nas it extends and rises at a low angle.\nIn comparison to the family, the individual hardly counts, but they all\nwait for her at a teahouse inside the wall.\nFirst the gold knob, then blue tiers above the highest step,\nthe same color as the sky.\n\nWhen one person came to gain confidence,\nshe imagines he felt symmetry as flight after his fast among seven meteorites\nin the dark. He really felt like a globe revolving within a globe.\nEven the most singular or indivisible particle or heavenly sphere will adjust\nwhen the axis extending beyond itself is pushed, or the sphere it is within\nis pushed. What she thought was her balance flattens into a stylized dragon\non the marble paving stones.\n\nYet she's reluctant to leave the compound. Only the emperor\ncould walk its center line. Now, anyone can imagine how it felt\nto bring heaven news. She is trying to remember this in Hong Kong\nas the tram pulls suddenly above skyscrapers and the harbor\nand she flattens against her seat, like a reversal occurring in the poles,\nor what she meant by, no one can imagine how."}
