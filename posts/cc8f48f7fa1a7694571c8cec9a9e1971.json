{"subject": "On A View Of Pasadena From The Hills", "text": "From the high terrace porch I watch the dawn. \nNo light appears, though dark has mostly gone, \nSunk from the cold and monstrous stone. The hills \nLie naked but not light. The darkness spills \nDown the remoter gulleys; pooled, will stay \nToo low to melt, not yet alive with day. \nBelow the windows, the lawn, matted deep \nUnder its close-cropped tips with dewy sleep, \nGives off a faint hush, all its plushy swarm \nAlive with coolness reaching to be warm. \nGray windows at my back, the massy frame \nDull with the blackness that has not a name; \nBut down below, the garden is still young, \nOf five years\u2019 growth, perhaps, and terrace-hung, \nDrop by slow drop of seeping concrete walls. \nSuch are the bastions of our pastorals! \nHere are no palms! They once lined country ways, \nWhere old white houses glared down dusty days, \nWith small round towers, blunt-headed through small trees. \nThose towers are now the hiving place of bees. \nThe palms were coarse; their leaves hung thick with dust; \nThe roads were muffled deep. But now deep rust \nHas fastened on the wheels that labored then. \nPeace to all such, and to all sleeping men! \nI lived my childhood there, a passive dream \nIn the expanse of that recessive scheme. \nSlow air, slow fire! O deep delay of Time! \nThat summer crater smoked like slaking lime, \nThe hills so dry, so dense the underbrush, \nThat where I pushed my way the giant hush \nWas changed to soft explosion as the sage \nBroke down to powdered ash, the sift of age, \nAnd fell along my path, a shadowy rift. \nOn these rocks now no burning ashes drift; \nMowed lawn has crept along the granite bench; \nThe yellow blossoms of acacia drench \nThe dawn with pollen; and, with waxen green, \nThe long leaves of the eucalypti screen \nThe closer hills from view\u2014lithe, tall, and fine, \nAnd nobly clad with youth, they bend and shine. \nThe small dark pool, jutting with living rock, \nTrembles at every atmospheric shock, \nBlurred to its depth with the cold living ooze. \nFrom cloudy caves, heavy with summer dews, \nThe shyest and most tremulous beings stir, \nThe pulsing of their fins a lucent blur, \nThat, like illusion, glances off the view. \nThe pulsing mouths, like metronomes, are true, \nThis is my father\u2019s house, no homestead here \nThat I shall live in, but a shining sphere \nOf glass and glassy moments, frail surprise, \nMy father\u2019s phantasy of Paradise; \nWhich melts upon his death, which he attained \nWith loss of heart for every step he gained. \nToo firmly gentle to displace the great, \nHe crystallized this vision somewhat late; \nForbidden now to climb the garden stair, \nHe views the terrace from a window chair. \nHis friends, hard shaken by some twenty years, \nTremble with palsy and with senile fears, \nIn their late middle age gone cold and gray. \nFine men, now broken. That the vision stay, \nThey spend astutely their depleted breath, \nWith tired ironic faces wait for death. \nBelow the garden the hills fold away. \nDeep in the valley, a mist fine as spray, \nReady to shatter into spinning light, \nConceals the city at the edge of night. \nThe city, on the tremendous valley floor, \nDraws its dream deeper for an instant more, \nSuperb on solid loam, and breathing deep, \nPoised for a moment at the edge of sleep. \nCement roads mark the hills, wide, bending free \nOf cliff and headland. Dropping toward the sea, \nThrough suburb after suburb, vast ravines \nSwell to the summer drone of fine machines. \nThe driver, melting down the distance here, \nMay cast in flight the faint hoof of a deer \nOr pass the faint head set perplexedly. \nAnd man-made stone outgrows the living tree, \nAnd at its rising, air is shaken, men \nAre shattered, and the tremor swells again, \nExtending to the naked salty shore, \nRank with the sea, which crumbles evermore."}
