{"subject": "Returning", "text": "You come home, sitting on my shoulders.\nI bid you farewell at door. Death tiptoes in dark\nbefore looking at the bare hands. A new concept of\nending comes out from crozier. Uncoiling has stopped.\nIn loincloth a truth unravels the mystery of cells. A\nwarm transparency. You walk around objectively, \nreturning the gifts to birds, bees and aspens. It\nwas time not to put up excuses. The wings are tired\nand wind was falling.\n\n           Let the dance of nothingness start! \n Satish Verma"}
