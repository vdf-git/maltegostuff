{"subject": "Salvation", "text": "I had drifted out far beyond\nill-reputed water metaphors\ntipped off by a cunning editor.\nCareful not to turn oceans to sand,\nI considered cityscapes\nas the inside of a river oyster.\n\nI gave up amphetamines and yoga,\nhunting around for an autobiography\nI could live with. I ate hearty steaks\nand wandered aimlessly willingly \nuntil blind chance knocked at my door\nyelling, \u2018The Gold Coast saved me.\u2019\n\nI saw everywhere I\u2019d gone wrong\nrunning about in her sun-filled hazel eyes.\nThe waves were glass escalators rising \nshy with the hum of contentment.\nI counted the change in my pockets \nas the horizons clouded over with promise.\nI had just enough for the last cocktail."}
