{"subject": "Modern Love Xlii: I Am To Follow Her", "text": "I am to follow her. There is much grace \nIn woman when thus bent on martyrdom. \nThey think that dignity of soul may come, \nPerchance, with dignity of body. Base! \nBut I was taken by that air of cold \nAnd statuesque sedateness, when she said \n'I'm going'; lit a taper, bowed her head, \nAnd went, as with the stride of Pallas bold. \nFleshly indifference horrible! The hands \nOf Time now signal: O, she's safe from me! \nWithin those secret walls what do I see \nWhere first she set the taper down she stands: \nNot Pallas: Hebe shamed! Thoughts black as death, \nLike a stirred pool in sunshine break. Her wrists \nI catch: she faltering, as she half resists, \n'You love. . . ? love. . . ? love. . . ?' all on an in-drawn breath."}
