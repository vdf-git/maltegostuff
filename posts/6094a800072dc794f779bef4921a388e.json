{"subject": "The Oath", "text": "It was near evening, the room was cold\nHalf dark; Uncle Ben's brass bullet-mould\nAnd powder-horn and Major Bogan's face\nAbove the fire in the half-light plainly said:\nThere's naught to kill but the animated dead.\nHorn nor mould nor major follows the chase.\nBeing cold I urged Lytle to the fire\nIn the blank twilight with not much left untold\nBy two old friends when neither's a great liar.\nWe sat down evenly in the smoky chill.\nThere's precious little to say between day and dark,\nPerhaps a few words on the implacable will\nOf time sailing like a magic barque\nOr something as fine for the amenities,\nTill dusk seals the window, the fire grows bright,\nAnd the wind saws the hill with a swarm of bees.\nNow meditating a little on the firelight\nWe heard the darkness grapple with the night\nAnd give an old man's valedictory wheeze\nFrom his westward breast between his polar jaws;\nThen Lytle asked: Who are the dead?\nWho are the living and the dead?\nAnd nothing more was said.\nSo I, leaving Lytle to that dream,\nDecided what it is in time that gnaws\nThe ageing fury of a mountain stream\nWhen suddenly as an ignorant mind will do\nI thought I heard the dark pounding its head\nOn a rock, crying: Who are the dead?\nThen Lytle turned with an oath-By God it's true!"}
