{"subject": "I Want, I Want", "text": "Open-mouthed, the baby god\nImmense, bald, though baby-headed,\nCried out for the mother's dug.\nThe dry volcanoes cracked and split,\n\nSand abraded the milkless lip.\nCried then for the father's blood\nWho set wasp, wolf and shark to work,\nEngineered the gannet's beak.\n\nDry-eyed, the inveterate patriarch\nRaised his men of skin and bone,\nBarbs on the crown of gilded wire,\nThorns on the bloody rose-stem."}
