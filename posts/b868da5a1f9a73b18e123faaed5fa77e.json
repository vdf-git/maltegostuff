Not the mansion\nYou inhabit\nOn the\nLovely stolen hill\nAbove the sea\nOr the interior one:\nThe darkened\nDesolate\nShack.\n\nYou want to grow old\nLike\nThe Carters; \nCuring blindness\n&amp;\nBuilding houses\nFor\nThe Poor; \n\nMaking friends of those\nWho believe\nThey must fight.\n\nYou want to grow old\nLike\nThe Carters\nHolding hands\nWith someone\nYou love\n&amp;\nRiding bicycles\nLeisurely\nWhere the ground\nIs well known\n&amp; perfectly\nFlat.\n\nYou want to find\nAnd keep to the path\nLaid down\nInside you\nSuch a long time\nAgo.\n\nYou want to grow old\nLike\nThe Carters:\nSerene. Eyes\nTwinkling\nTo be accused\nOf\nNot getting\nIt right.\n\nUpfront, upright.\nSpeaking what to you is true.\n\nA person rich in Mothers.\nBeloved.\n\nAnd:\nHonoring what is black\nIn you."}
