{"subject": "Sweeney", "text": "It was somewhere in September, and the sun was going down, \nWhen I came, in search of 'copy', to a Darling-River town; \n'Come-and-have-a-drink' we'll call it -- 'tis a fitting name, I think -- \nAnd 'twas raining, for a wonder, up at Come-and-have-a-drink. \n\n'Neath the public-house verandah I was resting on a bunk \nWhen a stranger rose before me, and he said that he was drunk; \nHe apologised for speaking; there was no offence, he swore; \nBut he somehow seemed to fancy that he'd seen my face before. \n\n'No erfence,' he said.  I told him that he needn't mention it, \nFor I might have met him somewhere; I had travelled round a bit, \nAnd I knew a lot of fellows in the bush and in the streets -- \nBut a fellow can't remember all the fellows that he meets. \n\nVery old and thin and dirty were the garments that he wore, \nJust a shirt and pair of trousers, and a boot, and nothing more; \nHe was wringing-wet, and really in a sad and sinful plight, \nAnd his hat was in his left hand, and a bottle in his right. \n\nHis brow was broad and roomy, but its lines were somewhat harsh, \nAnd a sensual mouth was hidden by a drooping, fair moustache; \n(His hairy chest was open to what poets call the 'wined', \nAnd I would have bet a thousand that his pants were gone behind). \n\nHe agreed:  'Yer can't remember all the chaps yer chance to meet,' \nAnd he said his name was Sweeney -- people lived in Sussex-street. \nHe was campin' in a stable, but he swore that he was right, \n'Only for the blanky horses walkin' over him all night.' \n\nHe'd apparently been fighting, for his face was black-and-blue, \nAnd he looked as though the horses had been treading on him, too; \nBut an honest, genial twinkle in the eye that wasn't hurt \nSeemed to hint of something better, spite of drink and rags and dirt. \n\nIt appeared that he mistook me for a long-lost mate of his -- \nOne of whom I was the image, both in figure and in phiz -- \n(He'd have had a letter from him if the chap were living still, \nFor they'd carried swags together from the Gulf to Broken Hill.) \n\nSweeney yarned awhile and hinted that his folks were doing well, \nAnd he told me that his father kept the Southern Cross Hotel; \nAnd I wondered if his absence was regarded as a loss \nWhen he left the elder Sweeney -- landlord of the Southern Cross. \n\nHe was born in Parramatta, and he said, with humour grim, \nThat he'd like to see the city ere the liquor finished him, \nBut he couldn't raise the money.  He was damned if he could think \nWhat the Government was doing.  Here he offered me a drink. \n\nI declined -- 'TWAS self-denial -- and I lectured him on booze, \nUsing all the hackneyed arguments that preachers mostly use; \nThings I'd heard in temperance lectures (I was young and rather green), \nAnd I ended by referring to the man he might have been. \n\nThen a wise expression struggled with the bruises on his face, \nThough his argument had scarcely any bearing on the case: \n'What's the good o' keepin' sober?  Fellers rise and fellers fall; \nWhat I might have been and wasn't doesn't trouble me at all.' \n\nBut he couldn't stay to argue, for his beer was nearly gone. \nHe was glad, he said, to meet me, and he'd see me later on; \nHe guessed he'd have to go and get his bottle filled again, \nAnd he gave a lurch and vanished in the darkness and the rain. \n\n     .    .    .    .    . \n\nAnd of afternoons in cities, when the rain is on the land, \nVisions come to me of Sweeney with his bottle in his hand, \nWith the stormy night behind him, and the pub verandah-post -- \nAnd I wonder why he haunts me more than any other ghost. \n\nStill I see the shearers drinking at the township in the scrub, \nAnd the army praying nightly at the door of every pub, \nAnd the girls who flirt and giggle with the bushmen from the west -- \nBut the memory of Sweeney overshadows all the rest. \n\nWell, perhaps, it isn't funny; there were links between us two -- \nHe had memories of cities, he had been a jackeroo; \nAnd, perhaps, his face forewarned me of a face that I might see \nFrom a bitter cup reflected in the wretched days to be. \n\n     .    .    .    .    . \n\nI suppose he's tramping somewhere where the bushmen carry swags, \nCadging round the wretched stations with his empty tucker-bags; \nAnd I fancy that of evenings, when the track is growing dim, \nWhat he 'might have been and wasn't' comes along and troubles him."}
