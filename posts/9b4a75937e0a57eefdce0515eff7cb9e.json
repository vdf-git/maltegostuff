{"subject": "The Tramp's Soliloquy", "text": "I 'm sitting in the cells, alone, \n\nAll broken down and sad ; \nI hear the stifled curse and groan \n\nOf drunken men and bad ; \nI 'm hungry, thirsty, weak and sick \n\nFor hours my heart has ached ; \nI 'm thinking of my mother, and \n\nThe buttered buns she baked. \n\nI dream of home, and see the cows \n\nStand knee deep in the pond ; \nThe waving grain in yonder field \n\nThe tamaracs beyond ; \nMy sister blows the supper horn \n\nThe scented clover 's raked ; \nI '11 hie me home and feast upon \n\nThe buns my mother baked. \n\nI see the morning glory vines \nHang idle down, and droop \n\nAbout the table where I eat \nMy supper on the stoop ; \nBeyond the orchard stretches far, \nWith apple blossoms flaked ; \n\nWhile sister Mary butters buns \nMy dear old mother baked. \n\nI hear the twitter of the birds, \n\nThe bleating cry of sheep, \nThe call of Someone that I know ; \n\nI 'm troubled in my sleep ; \nI hear a groan and stupid cry \n\nA dreaming drunk's awaked \nI eat the bread of sorrow not \n\nThe buns my mother baked."}
