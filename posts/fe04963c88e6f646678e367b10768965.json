{"subject": "After All", "text": "The apples are ripe in the orchard,\nThe work of the reaper is done,\nAnd the golden woodlands redden\nIn the blood of the dying sun.\n\nAt the cottage-door the grandsire\nSits pale in his easy-chair,\nWhile the gentle wind of twilight\nPlays with his silver hair.\n\nA woman is kneeling beside him;\nA fair young head is pressed,\nIn the first wild passion of sorrow,\nAgainst his aged breast.\n\nAnd far from over the distance\nThe faltering echoes come\nOf the flying blast of trumpet\nAnd the rattling roll of drum.\n\nAnd the grandsire speaks in a whisper:\n'The end no man can see;\nBut we give him to his country\nAnd we give our prayers to Thee.'\n\nThe violets star the meadows,\nThe rose-buds fringe the door,\nAnd over the grassy orchard\nThe pink-white blossoms pour.\n\nBut the grandsire's chair is empty,\nThe cottage is dark and still;\nThere's a nameless grave in the battle-field,\nAnd a new one under the hill.\n\nAnd a pallid, tearless woman\nBy the cold hearth sits alone;\nAnd the old clock in the corner\nTicks on with a steady drone."}
