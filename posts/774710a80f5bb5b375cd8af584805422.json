{"subject": "Grace And Love", "text": "Two flower-enfolding crystal vases she\nI love fills daily, mindful but of one:\nAnd close behind pale morn she, like the sun\nPriming our world with light, pours, sweet to see,\nClear water in the cup, and into me\nThe image of herself: and that being done,\nChoice of what blooms round her fair garden run\nIn climbers or in creepers or the tree\nShe ranges with unerring fingers fine,\nTo harmony so vivid that through sight\nI hear, I have her heavenliness to fold\nBeyond the senses, where such love as mine,\nSuch grace as hers, should the strange Fates withhold\nTheir starry more from her and me, unite."}
