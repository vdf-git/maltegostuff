{"subject": "Grecian Yesterday", "text": "To the loved days we shared alone,\nLeda, beyond the moons and miles\nThe swan of my desire has flown.\n\nAgain you stand, as once you stood,\nNaked, with sun-ignited hair,\nBefore the dark Hellenic wood\n\nThat hangs beside that halcyon sea:\nAnd all my heart is turned to love,\nAnd love fulfills the veins of me.\n\nNo Syrinx flees, no satyr sallies\nFrom the still oaks and brooding bays:\nIn us their ancient rapture rallies\n\nThat sweeps away the world, and brings\nOnce more the many-flowered prime\nAfter an age of flowerless things.\n\nTo the loved days we shared alone,\nLeda, beyond the moons and miles\nThe swan of my desire has flown."}
