{"subject": "The Love Sonnets Of Proteus.  Part Ii: To Juliet: Xxv", "text": "THE SAME CONTINUED\nGive me thy kiss, Juliet, give me thy kiss!\nI with my body worship thee and vow\nSuch service to thy needs as man can do.\nI ask no nobler servitude than this.\nAm I not thine, the bondsman of thy love,\nWhom thou hast bought and ransomed with a price,\nAnd therefore worthy to be ranked above\nThe very stars that in the heavens move?\nAnd, Juliet, since I thus am one with you,\nAnd kinglier than Plantagenet or Guelph,\nWhat price were meet for my high mightiness?\nWhat gold of joy, what hope, what heavenly pelf\nHast thou to give? Nay, sweetest, give thyself."}
