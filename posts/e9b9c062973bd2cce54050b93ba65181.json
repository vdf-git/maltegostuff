{"subject": "I Dream Of Jeanie With The Light Brown Hair", "text": "I dream of Jeanie with the light brown hair,\nBorne, like a vapor, on the summer air;\nI see her tripping where the bright streams play,\nHappy as the daisies that dance on her way.\nMany were the wild notes her merry voice would pour,\nMany were the blithe birds that warbled them o'er:\nOh! I dream of Jeanie with the light brown hair,\nFloating, like a vapor, on the soft summer air.\n\nI long for Jeanie with the daydawn smile,\nRadiant in gladness, warm with winning guile;\nI hear her melodies, like joys gone by,\nSighing round my heart o'er the fond hopes that die:\nSighing like the night wind and sobbing like the rain,\nWailing for the lost one that comes not again:\nOh! I long for Jeanie, and my heart bows low,\nNever more to find her where the bright waters flow.\n\nI sigh for Jeanie, but her light form strayed\nFar from the fond hearts round her native glade;\nHer smiles have vanished and her sweet songs flown,\nFlitting like the dreams that have cheered us and gone.\nNow the nodding wild flowers may wither on the shore\nWhile her gentle fingers will cull them no more:\nOh! I sigh for Jeanie with the light brown hair,\nFloating, like a vapor, on the soft summer air."}
