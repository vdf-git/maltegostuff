{"subject": "A Poet Leaving Athens", "text": "Speak not too ill of me, Athenian friends!\nNor ye, Athenian sages, speak too ill!\nFrom others of all tribes am I secure.\nI leave your confines: none whom you caress,\nFinding me hungry and athirst, shall dip\nInto Cephisos the grey bowl to quench\nMy thirst, or break the horny bread, and scoop\nStiffly around the scanty vase, wherewith\nTo gather the hard honey at the sides,\nAnd give it me for having heard me sing.\nSages and friends! a better cause remains\nFor wishing no black sail upon my mast.\n'Tis, friends and sages! lest, when other men\nSay words a little gentler, ye repent,\nYet be forbidden by stern pride to share\nThe golden cup of kindness, pushing back\nYour seats, and gasping for a draught of scorn.\nAlas! shall this too, never lackt before,\nBe, when you most would crave it, out of reach?\nThus on the plank, now Neptune is invoked,\nI warn you of your peril: I must live,\nAnd ye, O friends, howe'er unwilling, may."}
