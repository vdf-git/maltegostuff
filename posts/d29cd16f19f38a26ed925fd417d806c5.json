{"subject": "The Common Men", "text": "The great men framed the fierce decrees \nEmbroiling State with State; \nThey bit their thumbs across the seas \nIn diplomatic hate; \nThey lit the pyre whose glare and heat \nMake Hell itself seem cold; \nThe flames bloomed red above the wheat, \nTheir wild profusion wreathed the street- \nThen in the smoke and fiery sleet \nThe common men took hold. \n\nWhere Babel was with Bedlam freed, \nAnd wide the gates were flung; \nTo chaos, while the anarch breed \nIn all the world gave tongue, \nThe common men in close array, \nBy mountain, plain and sea, \nWent outward girded for the fray, \nOn one dear quest, whate'er they pay \nIn blood and pain\u2014the open way \nTo keep for Liberty. \n\nThe common men who never tire, \nUnsightly in the mirk \nOf caking blood and smoke and mire, \nPush forward with their work; \nA while in foulest pits entombed, \nResistless, still and slow, \nBurnt, broken, stifled, seeming doomed, \nPast where the flowers of Satan bloomed, \nUp gutted hills with shell-breath plumed, \nThe stubborn armies go. \n\nContending in the shattered sky \nIn empyrean wars, \nThe sons of simple men out-vie \nGod's splendid meteors; \nWhere'er the mills of Vulcan roared \nAnd blinked against the night, \nSwart shapes with sweat-washed eyes have \nstored \nThe clean, lean lightnings of the Lord \nTo be a league-long, leaping sword \nIn this our holy fight. \n\nThe small men know the burden well, \nThe dreadful paths they know, \nWith fear and death and torture dwell. \nAnd sup and sleep with, woe. \nThey're riven in the shrapnel gust, \nBut; blind and reeling, plan \nAnother blow, a final thrust \nTo subjugate the tyrant's lust. \nSo, bleeding, blundering in the dust, \nMen fight and die for MAN."}
