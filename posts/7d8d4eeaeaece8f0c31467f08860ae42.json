{"subject": "Recollection", "text": "Do you remember the ol' \nIsle o' Skye\n, Billy,\nAs we sailed in years ago;\nThe time we loaded nitrates home from Chile?\n' . . . Ay, I do so.'\n\nAn' how we was 'ove to in the South Atlantic\nFor two nights an' a day;\nAn' the long calm as druv the Ol' Man frantic,\nAn' the dustin' we 'ad in the Bay?\n\nShe was a tough ship, Bill, an' no bloomin' error,\nWas that same ol' hooker,\nAn' for losin' 'ands from the braces a fair terror -\nBut a rare good-looker.\n\nAn' the skipper was the 'ardest nut I've clapped my eyes on,\n'Cept the mate, an' 'e was worse;\nAn' the grub Slush served us out was more like p'ison,\nFit to make a bone idol curse.\n\nThere warn't none o' these 'ere curries an' calavances\nUsed to come our way then,\nAn' such-like stuff as Board o' Trade blokes fancies\nIs good scoff for sailor-men.\n\nAnd, Bill, it's rum, but I'd go back this minute,\nI'd give the good grub an' the good pay\nTo be bitin' on 'ard tack with weevils in it\nIn that ol' ship this day . . . \n\nTo be layin' out on a yard when it's hailin' an' snowin'\nOff o' the Straits o' Le Mair,\nFistin' a frozen course with big guns blowin'\nSo's you can't 'ear to swear . . . \n\nOr runnin' the Eastin' down with both rails rollin'\nAn' burying theirselves in foam . . . \nOr climbin' the Trade at a good fourteen on a bowline,\nWith 'er course set for 'ome . . . \n\nOr haulin' topsail yards in the Biscay weather\nWhen the waist's a smother o' snow -\nOr settin' on the fore-hatch yarnin' together\nIn fine watches below . . . \n\nSharin' the good an' the bad, an' the rough an' the smooth of it\nIn the ol' \nIsle o' Skye\n. . . \nThat's where I'd be if I could, Bill, an' that's the plain truth of it . . . \n' . . . And, by cripes, so would I!'"}
