{"subject": "Bluegrass Rhapsody", "text": "for Ben\n\nThis is the green we grew up in: humid blue of the blur of our adolescence;\nweedy dark. These are the roads we drove into the country with whomever had\nsweet, cheap wine. This is the sky of watery silk under which we wrecked our\nhearts, cried out; the song of gnat and firefly and wasp and dove and frog.\nHere is the place I chose exile from, sharp-hearted, sure of some other\nworld. And still, how it takes me back. How you grip the wheel and laugh,\ndon't say Remember. Don't say anything."}
