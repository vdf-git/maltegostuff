{"subject": "Ashtabula Disaster", "text": "Air -- \"Gently Down the Stream of Time\"\nHave you heard of the dreadful fate\nOf Mr. P. P. Bliss and wife?\nOf their death I will relate,\nAnd also others lost their life;\nAshtabula Bridge disaster,\nWhere so many people died\nWithout a thought that destruction\nWould plunge them 'neath the wheel of tide.\n\nCHORUS:\n\nSwiftly passed the engine's call,\nHastening souls on to death,\nWarning not one of them all;\nIt brought despair right and left.\n\nAmong the ruins are many friends,\nCrushed to death amidst the roar;\nOn one thread all may depend,\nAnd hope they've reached the other shore.\nP. P. Bliss showed great devotion\nTo his faithful wife, his pride,\nWhen he saw that she must perish,\nHe died a martyr by her side.\n\nP. P. Bliss went home above -- \nLeft all friends, earth and fame,\nTo rest in God's holy love;\nLeft on earth his work and name.\nThe people love his work by numbers,\nIt is read by great and small,\nHe by it will be remembered,\nHe has left it for us all.\n\nHis good name from time to time\nWill rise on land and sea;\nIt is known in distant climes,\nLet it echo wide and free.\nOne good man among the number,\nFound sweet rest in a short time,\nHis weary soul may sweetly slumber\nWithin the vale, heaven sublime.\n\nDestruction lay on every side,\nConfusion, fire and despair;\nNo help, no hope, so they died,\nTwo hundred people over there.\nMany ties was there broken,\nMany a heart was filled with pain,\nEach one left a little token,\nFor above they live again."}
