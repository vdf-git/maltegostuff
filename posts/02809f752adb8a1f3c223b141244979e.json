{"subject": "Fairy", "text": "For Helen, in the virgin shadows and the \nimpassive radiance in astral silence, \nornamental saps conspired. \n\nSummer's ardour was confided \nto silent birds and due indolence \nto a priceless mourning boat \nthrough gulfs of dead loves \nand fallen perfumes. \n\n-After the moment of the woods women's song \nto the rumble of the torrent in the ruin of the wood, \nof the tinkle of the cowbells to the echo of the vales, \nand the cries of the steppes.\n\n- For Helen's childhood, furs and shadows trembled, \nand the breast of the poor and the legends of heaven. \nAnd her eyes and her dance superior \neven to the precious radiance, \nto cold influences, to the pleasure of the unique \nsetting and the unique hour."}
