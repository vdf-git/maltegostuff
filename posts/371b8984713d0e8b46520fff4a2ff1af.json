{"subject": "The Village Atheist", "text": "Ye young debaters over the doctrine\nOf the soul's immortality\nI who lie here was the village atheist,\nTalkative, contentious, versed in the arguments\nOf the infidels.\nBut through a long sickness\nCoughing myself to death\nI read the Upanishads and the poetry of Jesus.\nAnd they lighted a torch of hope and intuition\nAnd desire which the Shadow,\nLeading me swiftly through the caverns of darkness,\nCould not extinguish.\nListen to me, ye who live in the senses\nAnd think through the senses only:\nImmortality is not a gift,\nImmortality is an achievement;\nAnd only those who strive mightily\nShall possess it."}
