{"subject": "The Birth", "text": "The birth isn't about poetry\nIt is about screaming pain on a Sunday\nHailing a cab and head racing\nTo the hospital, now so close to the new apartment\n\nI had a baby inside of me\nBut no one expected it to happen so fast\nOr then at least they said they didn't\nMaybe they expected it to happen so fast\nAll along\n\nAlone in the waiting room I shook and shook\nAnd the blood ran down my legs\nLater with the magnesium\nI thought of the many permutations of the bald head\nPale, pickling fish skin, glowing with scales\n\nWhen she came out, she was dark and full of hair\nNo blood, but born in the caul\nLike the other magical realities of my past accomplishments\nWhen she came out she cried and it sounded like me\nBut passed me, into her new reality\n\nNow 3 weeks later, they say I am still not an erotic object\nSo I wander the park in the snow with my friend\nWe light candles and pray to the darkness\nWe light the park on fire and the police come and find us\n\nWhen they take us to the jail, I say no, it's not right\nI am a mother after all\nThey say, but where is your baby\nAnd I say, no no, my baby my baby\nThey say, yes yes, look at your beautiful baby\n\nI say, I do, I do\nLook, look, and listen\nMy baby my baby\nShe's here"}
