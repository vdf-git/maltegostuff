{"subject": "Songs Of My Native Land", "text": "Air - 'Happy Land.'\nSongs of my native land,\nTo me how dear!\nSongs of my infancy \nSweet to mine ear!\nEntwined with my youthful days,\nWi' the bonny banks and braes,\nWhere the winding burnie strays\nMurmuring near.\n\nStrains of my native land\nThat thrill the soul,\nPouring the magic of\nYour soft control!\nOften has your minstrelsy\nSoothed the pang of misery,\nWinging rapid thought away\nTo realms on high.\n\nWeary pilgrims \nthere\nhave rest,\nTheir wand'rings o'er;\nThere the slave, no more oppressed,\nHails Freedom's shore.\nSin shall there no more deface,\nSickness, pain, and sorrow cease,\nEnding in eternal peace,\nAnd songs of joy!\n\nThere, where the seraphs sing\nIn cloudless day, -\nThere, where the higher praise\nThe ransom'd pay.\nSoft strains of the happy land,\nChanted by the heavenly band,\nWho can fully understand \nHow sweet ye be!"}
