{"subject": "The Plot Against The Giant", "text": "First Girl\nWhen this yokel comes maundering,\nWhetting his hacker,\nI shall run before him,\nDiffusing the civilest odors\nOut of geraniums and unsmelled flowers.\nIt will check him. \n\nSecond Girl\nI shall run before him,\nArching cloths besprinkled with colors\nAs small as fish-eggs.\nThe threads\nWill abash him. \n\nThird Girl\nOh, la...le pauvre!\nI shall run before him,\nWith a curious puffing.\nHe will bend his ear then.\nI shall whisper\nHeavenly labials in a world of gutturals.\nIt will undo him."}
