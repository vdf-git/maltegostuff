{"subject": "To Plead My Faith...", "text": "To plead my faith where faith had no reward,\nTo move remorse where favor is not borne,\nTo heap complaints where she doth not regard, -\nWere fruitless, bootless, vain, and yield but scorn.\n\nI lov\u00e9d her whom all the world admired,\nI was refused of her that can love none;\nAnd my vain hopes, which far too high aspired,\nIs dead, and buried, and for ever gone.\n\nForget my name, since you have scorned my love,\nAnd woman-like do not too late lament;\nSince for your sake I do all mischief prove,\nI none accuse nor nothing do repent.\n\nI was as fond as ever she was fair,\nYet loved I not more than I now despair."}
