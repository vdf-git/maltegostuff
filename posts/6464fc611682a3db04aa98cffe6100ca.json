{"subject": "In Dove Cottage Garden", "text": "ON the terrace lies the sunlight, fretted with the shade \nOf the wilding apple-orchard Wordsworth made. \n\nSunlight falls upon the aspen, and the cedar glows \nLike the laurel or the climbing Christmas rose. \n\nThrough green-golden vistas downward if your glances fall, \nHardly would you guess the cottage there at all. \n\nBines of bryony and bramble overhang the green \nOf the crowding scarlet-runner and the bean. \n\nBut I mark one quiet casement, ivy-covered still. \nThere he sat, I think, and loved this little hill; \n\nLoved the rocky stair that led him upward to the seat \nColeridge fashioned; loved the fragrant, high retreat \n\nIn the wood above the garden. There he walked, and there \nIn his heart the beauty gathered to a prayer. \n\nIn the sunshine by the cottage doorway I can see, \nIn among her Christmas roses, Dorothy. \n\nDeeper joy and truer service, fuller draught of life, \nCame I doubt not to the sister, and the wife. \n\nLaurel, it may be, too early on his brow he set, \nAnd the thorn of life too lightly could forget. \n\nDorothy, wild heart and woman, chose the better way, \nMet the world with love and service every day. \n\nLove for life and life for loving, and the poet's part \nIs to love his life and, living, love his art. \n\nBut the shadow from the fellside falls, and all the scene \nMelts and runs, green-gold to slumbrous golden-green. \n\nShowers of golden light on Grasmere tremble into shade, \nWhile the garden grasses gather blade with blade; \n\nAnd one patient robin-redbreast, waiting, waiting long, \nSeals the twilight in the garden with a song."}
