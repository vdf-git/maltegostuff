{"subject": "Lines Written On Leaving New Rochelle", "text": "WHENE'ER thy wandering footstep bends \nIts pathway to the Hermit tree, \nAmong its cordial band of friends, \nSweet Mary! wilt thou number me? \n\nThough all too few the hours have roll'd \nThat saw the stranger linger here, \nIn memory's volume let them hold \nOne little spot to friendship dear. \n\nI oft have thought how sweet 'twould be \nTo steal the bird of Eden's art; \nAnd leave behind a trace of me \nOn every kind and friendly heart, \n\nAnd like the breeze in fragrance rolled, \nTo gather as I wander by, \nFrom every soul of kindred mould, \nSome touch of cordial sympathy. \n\n'Tis the best charm in life's dull dream, \nTo feel that yet there linger here \nBright eyes that look with fond esteem, \nAnd feeling hearts that hold me dear."}
