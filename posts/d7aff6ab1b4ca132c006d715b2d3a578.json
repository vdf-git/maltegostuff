{"subject": "The Falcon", "text": "I know a falcon swift and peerless\n  As e'er was cradled In the pine;\nNo bird had ever eye so fearless,\n  Or wing so strong as this of mine.\n\nThe winds not better love to pilot\n  A cloud with molten gold o'er run,\nThan him, a little burning islet,\n  A star above the coming sun.\n\nFor with a lark's heart he doth tower,\n  By a glorious upward instinct drawn;\nNo bee nestles deeper in the flower\n  Than he in the bursting rose of dawn.\n\nNo harmless dove, no bird that singeth,\n  Shudders to see him overhead;\nThe rush of his fierce swooping bringeth\n  To innocent hearts no thrill of dread.\n\nLet fraud and wrong and baseness shiver,\n  For still between them and the sky\nThe falcon Truth hangs poised forever\n  And marks them with his vengeful eye."}
