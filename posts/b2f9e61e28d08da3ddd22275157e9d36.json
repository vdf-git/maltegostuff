{"subject": "Upon Honour.  A Fragment.", "text": "Honour, I say, or honest Fame, \nI mean the substance, not the name; \n(Not that light heap of tawdry wares, \nErmin, Coronets, and Stars, \nWhich often is by merit sought, \nBy gold and flatt'ry oft'ner bought. \nThe shade, for which Ambition looks, \nIn Selden's or in Ashmole's books):\nBut the true glory which proceeds, \nReflected bright from honest deeds, \nWhich we in our Own breast perceive, \nAnd Kings can neither take nor give."}
