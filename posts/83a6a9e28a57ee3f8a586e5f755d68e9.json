{"subject": "Where Children Play", "text": "On every street there's a certain place\nWhere the children gather to romp and race;\nThere's a certain house where they meet in throngs\nTo play their games and to sing their songs,\nAnd they trample the lawn with their busy feet\nAnd they scatter their playthings about the street,\nBut though some folks order them off, I say,\nLet the house be mine where the children play.\n\nArmies gather about the door\nAnd fill the air with their battle roar;\nCowboys swinging their lariat loops\nDash round the house with the wildest whoops,\nAnd old folks have to look out when they\nAre holding an Indian tribe at bay,\nFor danger may find them on flying feet,\nWho pass by the house where the children meet.\n\nThere are lawns too lovely to bear the weight\nOf a troop of boys when they roller skate;\nThere are porches fine that must never know\nThe stamping of footsteps that come and go,\nBut on every street there's a favorite place\nWhere the children gather to romp and race,\nAnd I'm glad in my heart that it's mine to say\nOurs is the house where the children play."}
