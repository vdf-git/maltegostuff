{"subject": "A Dancer's Challenge", "text": "Figure of vigour, vibrating in every fibre\nFiery fusion of finesse and vim\nFast as light across the vast arena\nI fear as you veer towards my seat\nVaulting without a fault upon\nThe volleys of flute and drum\nAnd fiddle and vaunting lyre\nNow feigning love, now vanity, now folly\nYou vary your step like a visiting fairy\nSurveying a frenzied field of faces\nFeasting upon your feline flow\nAnd vowing unfettered love for you\nI view with envy what only a few can even dream\nA vital vase abashing my sluggish shape like a farce\nThough feverish with a voracious desire\nCan I accept your ferocious call to dance?"}
