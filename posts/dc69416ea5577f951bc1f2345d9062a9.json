{"subject": "The Herdsman", "text": "I'm herdsman of a flock. \nThe sheep are my thoughts \nAnd my thoughts are all sensations. \nI think with my eyes and my ears \nAnd my hands and feet \nAnd nostrils and mouth. \n\nTo think a flower is to see and smell it. \nTo eat a fruit is to sense its savor. \n\nAnd that is why, when I feel sad, \nIn a day of heat, because of so much joy \nAnd lay me down in the grass to rest \nAnd close my sun-warmed eyes, \nI feel my whole body relaxed in reality \nAnd know the whole truth and am happy."}
