{"subject": "The Garden", "text": "AND now it is all to be done over again,\nAnd what will come of it only God can know.\nWhat has become of the furrows ploughed by pain,\nAnd the plants set row on row?\n\nWhere are the lines of beautiful bending trees,\nThe gracious springs, the depths of delicate shade,\nThe sunny spaces loud with the humming of bees,\nAnd the grassy paths in the garden my life had made?\n\nLightning and earthquake now have blasted and riven;\nEven the trees that I trusted could not stand:\nNow it lies here to the bitter winds of heaven,\nA barren and a desolated land."}
