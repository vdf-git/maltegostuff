{"subject": "The Oracle", "text": "DOWN in its crystal hollow \nGleams the ebon well of ink: \nIn the deepest drop lies lurking \nThe thought all men shall think. \n\nFair on the waiting tablet \nLies the empty paper's space: \nOut of its snow shall flush a word \nLike an angel's earnest face. \n\nWho in those depths shall cast his line \nFor the gnome that hugs that thought? \nWho from the snowy field shall charm \nThat flower of truth untaught? \n\nNot in the lore of the ancients, \nNot in the yesterday: \nOn the lips of the living moments \nThe gods their message lay. \n\nSomewhere near it is waiting, \nLike a night-wind wandering free, \nSeeking a mouth to speak through,\u2014 \nWhose shall the message be? \n\nIt may steal forth like a flute note, \nIt may be suddenly hurled \nIn blare upon blare of a trumpet blast, \nTo startle and stir the world. \n\nHark! but just on the other side \nSome thinbest wall of dreams, \nMurmurs a whispered music, \nAnd softest rose-light gleams. \n\nListen, and watch, and tell the world \nWhat it almost dies to know. \nOr wait\u2014and the wise old world will say, \n'I knew it long ago.'"}
