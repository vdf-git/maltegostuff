{"subject": "Love\u2019s Height -", "text": "LOVE'S name is easy saying; yet who knows \nLove's uttermost, who loves not in his love \nThe highest he has known, and yet above \nThat highest vision finds his idol grows? \nSafe pinnacle of rapturous repose! \nAnd final agony of gladness! this-- \nTo spend thy conscience glowing in thy kiss,-- \nThy soul's high best at one with passion's throes. \n\nNo inward half-relentings, nought of rift \n'Twixt clay and spirit that should discord make; \nBut awful, lavish homage, free to take \nOnly to give the richlier, gift on gift; \nNo better self made captive for love's sake, \nBut love upraised to love, that love doth lift."}
