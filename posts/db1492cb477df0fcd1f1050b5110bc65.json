{"subject": "To Her That Weeps", "text": "Oh, beloved wife of the dear departed, \nTo thee I sing: be not brok'n hearted; \nThe God that called thy loved one from thy side \nHath sent an angel o'er thy path to guide. \n\nI know it's hard to give up one so dear, \nTo whom was trusted all thy love and care, \nBut death, my friend, is the common lot of all, \nAnd all must answer freely to the call. \n\nAh, weep no more, thy loved one is at rest\u2014 \nExpel the sorrow from thy aching breast; \nPray murmur not, it is our Father's will \nAnd He in love and mercy 'll keep thee still. \n\nGo forth, oh song, in strains both loud and clear, \nAnd soothe her aching heart, dry every tear; \nAnd with thy cloak of love securely fold, \nThen pray that God her from all danger 'll hold."}
