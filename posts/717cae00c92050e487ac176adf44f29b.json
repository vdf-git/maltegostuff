{"subject": "The Mail Of Steps", "text": "In the smallest room \nthere's a flicker of light. \nYour steps chase me to here \nand my hearing follows them like a dog. \nI listen \nuntil I lose their tracks among the roads. \nI turn over my hand. \nI try to make a secret out of my fingers. \nI close my eyes. \nI try to make with my furrowed face a climate \nor bread or a mask. \nI swim under my own breathing. \nYour steps resemble silence. \nLike a sprinkling of flour on asphalt \nthe sellers carry them with their voices, \nthe lorries take them until they disappear. \nThey are my mail \nand you'll have none of them \nexcept this echo \nas you take off your dress \nwhere there'll be no foot steps \nslowing by your door."}
