{"subject": "The Water", "text": "Let others make the songs of love\nFor our young struggling nation;\nBut I will sing while e\u2019er I live\nThe Songs of Irrigation;\nFor while the white man shall beget\nThe white man\u2019s son and daughter,\nThe two most precious things for us\nShall still be wheat and water.\n\nWe\u2019ve been drought-ruined in the West\u2014\nAnd ever in my dreaming\nI see wide miles of waving crops\nAnd sheets of water gleaming,\nOn plains where fortune died of thirst\nWhen my brave father sought her,\nI see the painted barges pass\nAlong the winding water.\n\nAnd now the glorious scheme\u2019s afoot,\nOur country to deliver\nFrom drought and death on blazing waste,\nBy long neglected river.\nYou\u2019ll see the boodlers of the world\nRush in from every quarter:\nThey want the land,\u2014the gold-reefed sand,\nAnd now they\u2019ll want the water.\n\nBright intellects will plan the dykes\u2014\nWith little gold to gild them\u2014\nBright intellects will plan the dykes,\nThe people pay to build them;\nAnd when we\u2019ve made our long canals,\nAnd lakes in every quarter,\nThen ours would be the \u201cguarantee\u201d\u2014\nThe Trust would own the water.\n\nThey\u2019d hold the bores and aqueducts,\nThe water-ways and barges,\nAnd we would live, or we would starve\nAccording to their charges;\nFrom all the Edens in the West\nThey\u2019d bar our sons and daughters\u2014\nThey\u2019d hold the land, ten leagues or so,\nEach side the rippling waters.\n\nBut those who fight to hold their own,\nThe Lord and time delivers;\nAs we have held our railway lines,\nSo we shall hold our rivers.\nWe\u2019ll find the money, as was found\nThe money spent in slaughter,\nTo build our dykes and build our dams,\nAnd we shall own the water."}
