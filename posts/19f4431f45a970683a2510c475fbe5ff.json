{"subject": "Desiree", "text": "She had as many loves as she had follies,\nAnd all her light loves lightly sang her praises;\nBut now, laid low beneath sharp-leaved sea-hollies\nAnd pale sea-daisies,\nHere at the limit of the hollow shore,\nFolly and praise are covered meetly o'er.\nWe will not tell her beads of beauty over:\nAll that we say, and all we leave unsaid\nBe buried with her. There 's no lightest lover\nBut scatters on her bed\nPansies for thoughts, and woodruff white as she,\nAnd, for remembrance, quiet rosemary.\nHere is the end of laughter: quenched together\nAre grief and mirth. Here, dancing feet fall still,\nHere, where wild thyme and sea-pinks brave wild weather\nAnd die at the wind's will.\nBring her no dreams here to her quiet home\nThou Sea, her sister! bring her weeds and foam."}
