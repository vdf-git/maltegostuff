{"subject": "A Wet Season", "text": "The rain is fierce, it flogs the earth,\nAnd man's in danger.\nO that my mother at my birth\nHad borne a stranger!\nThe flooded ground is all around.\nThe depth uncommon.\nHow blest I'd be if only she\nHad borne a salmon.\n\nIf still denied the solar glow\n'T were bliss ecstatic\nTo be amphibious-but O,\nTo be aquatic!\nWe're worms, men say, o' the dust, and they\nThat faith are firm of.\nO, then, be just: show me some dust\nTo be a worm of.\n\nThe pines are chanting overhead\nA psalm uncheering.\nIt's O, to have been for ages dead\nAnd hard of hearing!\nRestore, ye Pow'rs, the last bright hours\nThe dial reckoned;\n'Twas in the time of Egypt's prime\nRameses II."}
