{"subject": "Cruiskeen Lan", "text": "Let the Statesman swarm like bees, \nAt Receptions and Levees, \n  And Diplomats the drawing-room adorn; \nLet Patriots grow gray, \nFretting, fuming life away\u2014 \n  I'm contented with my Cruiskeen Lan.\n\nGra ma cree ma Cruiskeen,\nSlanthe gal ma Vourneen,\nGra ma cree ma Cruiskeen Lan;\nGra ma cree ma Cruiskeen,\nSlanthe gal ma Vourneen,\nGra ma cree ma Colleen ban, ban, ban, \nGra ma cree ma Colleen ban. \n\nLet the Great love pomp and show, \nAnd Life's pleasures all forego, \n  For Fame, that like a vapor soon is gone; \nAnd sour old Cent-per-cent \nCount his profits and his rents,\u2014 \n  I am richer with my Cruiskeen Lan.\n\nChorus.\n\nLet him who great would be\nCrook the hinges of the knee, \nAnd on Senators and Secretaries fawn;\nI cannot duck and bend,\nBut I'll always serve a friend,\nAnd enjoy my little Cruiskeen Lan.\n\nChorus.\n\nLet him who fain would thrive, \nUsurious bai'gains drive, \n  And what he calls his soul, to Satan pawn, \nI'll freely give and lend, \nAnd the rest as freely spend, \nAnd enjoy my darling Cruiskeen Lan.\n\nChorus.\n\nLet the Fop exhale in sighs, \nAt the blaze of Beauty's eyes, \n  While her jewels reconcile him to her scorn; \nThe melted rubies shine \nFor us in generous wine, \nAnd diamonds in our Cruiskeen Lan.\nChorus.\n\nLet Plutus have his rout,\nWhere you're squeezed and knocked about,\nAnd enjoy yourself immensely\u2014in a horn; \nLet the youthful and the gay \nEnjoy the bal masque;\nGive me a quiet Cruiskeen Lan.\n\nChorus.\n\nLet the banker give his feeds, \nWhere the modest no man heeds, \n  And Parvenus on pompous Dullness fawn; \nGive me a jollier set, \nOf clever fellows met, \nAt a friend's to taste his Cruiskeen Lan.\n\nChorus.\n\nFor no contracts we've to give, \nNor any posts by which to live, \n  And politics we gayly laugh to scorn; \nWhile like brothers here we stand, \nHeart to heart, and hand in hand, \nWith our smiling little Cruiskeen Lan.\n\nChorus.\n\nMore dear than gold to me \nShall the recollection be \n  Of the glorious Attic nights that are gone, \nWhen soul communed with soul, \nAs away the swift hours stole, \nWhile we drank our smiling Cruiskeen Lan.\n\nChorus.\n\nYou may roam the world around \nTo old ocean's farthest bound; \nVisit every land the sun looks down upon; \nAnd fellows to compare\nWith our set you'll find nowhere,\nWhen they meet to taste their Cruiskseen Lan.\n\nChorus.\n\nAt JOHNNY COYLE'S, egad! \nMany a frolic we have had; \n  At HOOVER'S, WALLACH'S, BERRY'S seen the dawn; \nAt CHARLEY BOTELER'S, too, \nYou with me, and I with you, \nHave enjoyed our smiling Cruiskeen Lan.\n\nChorus.\n\nThis evening with MCGUIRE, \nFun and frolic shall conspire \n  To dissipate the cares of daylight born; \nAnd may we ne'er forget \nThat we here to-night were met, \nTo take a kindly Cruiskeen Lan.\n\nChorus.\n\nBe friend to friend more dear; \nLet estrangements disappear \n  As the mists that flit away before the morn; \nGood-bye to jars and feud, \nLet the old ties be renewed, \nAs once more we take our Chruiskeen Lan.\n\nChorus."}
