{"subject": "Light Night", "text": "1\n\nA tree, enamel needles,\nowl takeoffs shake,\nflapping a sound and smell\nof underwing, like flags,\nthe clothy weight of flags.\nA cone of silence stuck\nwith diamonds, the watch\nshe hunts, the frayed band\nbroke. It was a black night.\nDawn walked on it, the sun\nset its heel. She won\u2019t\nfind: a boundary of marsh,\nthe island in the wood.\n\n               2\n\nStoop, dove, horrid maid,\nspread your chiffon on our\nwood rot breeding the\nDestroying Angel, white,\nlathe-shapely, trout-lily\nlovely. Taste, and have it.\n\n               3\n\nIn a rain-dusk dawn, the\nclearing edge, the wood\u2019s\nfangs, the clear crystal\ntwist of a salival stream,\nannounce you hence. Tear\nfree of me, mountain, old\nhome bone, down sheer fear\ntears mossed boulders\nbound me, pool, deceptive,\ntrout-full, laugh and\nchatter of finch and pecker,\ngargle my liquor skin I\ncatch your face on. Scar\na look and leave. A rust\nplush daycoach unfathers\nme. A field of crosses. Let\niron clang iron."}
