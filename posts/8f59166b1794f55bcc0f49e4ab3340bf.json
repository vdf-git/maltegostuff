{"subject": "I  V/S  We", "text": "Cannot decode the signature of fear beneath the huge eyes, \nserene and calm, darting right and left, like in stricken\nanimal at frenzy. Drift we must; will seldom cross the path.\nAgony of existence, flying thighs, erect humps, sliding on sand\ndunes. Even moon melts in our mouth.\nYou had kissed the frozen lips; of betrayed night.\nThe sudden gyration of hips, fading of stars, \nand waning of nameless memory. Let\u2019s go and\nhide in blasts of whistling train. Pale wool of \nknitted love cannot hold the heat. The waiting will \nbe over in minutes. Wheels will runover an epoch.\nI would raise my head after ages in astonishment. I was still  alive, cast \nin a different mould. Dislocation became my integrity, \nmy fate, a frightened truth.\nPeople were very short sighted, could not cross infinity.\nSupreme was in them, discounting morality."}
