{"subject": "Sleep", "text": "Terrific silences organized the room\nwhere I slept after your death. \nI was terrified to leave it. \nI imagined clearly the hallway \non the other side of the door,\nnarrow, well-lit, and neatly tiled.\nI took a pill, arranged the sheets,\nand pulled the room up over my shoulders.\nOut of breath I woke between doses\nto write down those dreams I remembered.\nFor quite a while, I talked to someone,\nwinnowing fear and catharsis\nfrom the same few memories.\nOne hour passed, then another\ntherapist, a different city, sometimes\nI tried not to repeat myself\nor insist that my grief was ending."}
