{"subject": "For Lucy, Who Came First", "text": "She simply settled down in one piece right where she was,\nin the sand of a long-vanished lake edge or stream- and died.\n\u00e2\u20ac\"Donald C. Johanson, paleoanthropologist\nWhen I put my hand up to my face\nI can trace her heavy jawbone and the sockets\nof her eyes under my skin. And in the dark\nI sometimes feel her trying to uncurl\t\nfrom where she sank into mudbound sleep\non that soft and temporary shore\n\nso staggeringly long ago, time\nhad not yet cut its straight line\nthrough the tangle of the planet,\nnor taken up the measured sweep\nthat stacks the days and seasons\ninto an ordered past.\n\nBut I can feel her stirring\nin the core of me, trying to rise up\nfrom the deep hollow where she fell\u00e2\u20ac\"\nwanting to prowl on long callused toes\nto see what made that shadow move,\nto face the creature in the dark thicket\n\nneeding to know if this late-spreading dawn\nwill bring handfuls of berries, black\nas blood, or the sting of snow,\nor the steady slap of sand and weed\nthat wraps itself like fur\naround the body."}
