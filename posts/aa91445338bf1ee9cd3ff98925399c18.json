{"subject": "Eve, Oh Eve", "text": "Why wouldn't Eve have eaten of the fruit?\nDidn't she have a hand to reach out with,\nFingers with which to make a fist?\nDidn't Eve have a stomach for feeling hunger, \nA tongue for feeling thirst,\nA heart with which to love?\n\nWell, then, why wouldn't Eve have eaten of the fruit?\nWhy would she merely have suppressed her wishes,\nRegulated her steps,\nSubdued her thirst?\nWhy would she have been so compelled \nTo keep Adam moving around in the Garden of Eden all their lives?\n\nBecause Eve did eat of the fruit,\nThere is sky and earth.\nBecause she has eaten, \n\n                    There are moon, sun, rivers, seas,\n\nBecause she has eaten, trees, plans and vines.\n\nbecause Eve has eaten of the fruit\n\n            there is joy, because she has eaten there is joy. \n\njoy, joy-\n\nEating  of the fruit, Eve made a heaven of the earth. \n\nEve, if you get hold of the fruit \n\n       don't ever refrain from eating."}
