{"subject": "Wind", "text": "I am no more but you live on,\nAnd the wind, whining and complaining,\nIs shaking house and forest, straining\nNot single fir trees one by one\nBut the whole wood, all trees together,\nWith all the distance far and wide,\nLike sail-less yachts in stormy weather\nWhen moored within a bay they lie.\nAnd this not out of wanton pride\nOr fury bent on aimless wronging,\nBut to provide a lullaby\nFor you with words of grief and longing,"}
