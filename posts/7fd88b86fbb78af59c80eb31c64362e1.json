{"subject": "My Lady", "text": "Bedecked in fashion trim,\nWith every curl a-quiver;\nOr leaping, light of limb,\nO'er rivulet and river;\nOr skipping o'er the lea\nOn daffodil and daisy;\nOr stretched beneath a tree,\nAll languishing and lazy;\nWhatever be her mood -\nBe she demurely prude\nOr languishingly lazy -\nMy lady drives me crazy!\nIn vain her heart is wooed,\nWhatever be her mood!\n\nWhat profit should I gain\nSuppose she loved me dearly?\nHer coldness turns my brain\nTo VERGE of madness merely.\nHer kiss - though, Heaven knows,\nTo dream of it were treason -\nWould tend, as I suppose,\nTo utter loss of reason!\nMy state is not amiss;\nI would not have a kiss\nWhich, in or out of season,\nMight tend to loss of reason:\nWhat profit in such bliss?\nA fig for such a kiss!"}
