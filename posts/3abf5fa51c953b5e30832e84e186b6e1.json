{"subject": "Love Afar", "text": "Love, art thou lonely to-day?\nLost love that I never see,\nLove that, come noon or come night,\nComes never to me;\nLove that I used to meet\nIn the hidden past, in the land\nOf forbidden sweet.\n\nLove! do you never miss\nThe old light in the days?\nDoes a hand\nCome and touch thee at whiles\nLike the wand of old smiles,\nLike the breath of old bliss?\nOr hast thou forgot,\nAnd is all as if not?\n\nWhat was it we swore?\n'Evermore!\nI and Thou,'\nAh, but Fate held the pen\nAnd wrote N\nJust before:\nSo that now,\nSee, it stands,\nOur seals and our hands,\n'I and Thou,\nNevermore!'\n\nWe said 'It is best!'\nAnd then, dear, I went\nAnd returned not again.\nForgive that I stir,\nLike a breath in thy hair,\nThe old pain,\n'Twas unmeant.\nI will strive, I will wrest\nIron peace-it \nis\nbest.\n\nBut, O for thy hand\nJust to hold for a space,\nFor a moment to stand\nIn the light of thy face;\nTranslate Then to Now,\nTo hear 'Is it Thou?'\nAnd reply\n'It is I!'\nThen, then I could rest,\nAh, then I could wait\nLong and late."}
