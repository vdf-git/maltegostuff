{"subject": "The Dream Fairy", "text": "A little fairy comes at night,\nHer eyes are blue, her hair is brown\u2019\nwith silver spots upon her wings,\nAnd from the moon she flutters down.\n\nShe has a little silver wand,\nAnd when a good child goes to bed\nShe waves her wand from right to left\nAnd makes a circle round her head,\n\nAnd then it dreams of pleasant things,\nOf fountains filled with fairy fish,\nAnd trees that bear delicious fruit,\nAnd bow their branches at a wish;\n\nOf arbours filled with dainty scents\nFrom lovely flowers that never fade,\nBright \u2018flies that flitter in the sun,\nAnd glow-worms shining in the shade;\n\nAnd talking birds with gifted tongues\nFor singing songs and telling tales,\nAnd pretty dwarfs to show the way\nThrough the fairy hills and fairy dales."}
