{"subject": "Black Box", "text": "Every crashed marriage has its black box, the blow-\nby-blow account of what went wrong and how,\nthe crescendo of mistakes that peaks, is for an instant\nquiet on its crest of trauma, then drowns itself and us\n\nin a cascade of static. The black box is what survives;\nanthracite gleaming in the wreckage where, preserved in anger,\nthe voices that it holds replay their lifetime of last moments\nand speak of how, until the very end, it might all have been\n\nso different; and how, right from the start, they knew it never would."}
