{"subject": "Spread The Truth!", "text": "BRAVE the anger of the wealthy! Scorn their bitter lying spite!\nTell the Truth in simple language, when you know that you are right!\nAnd they\u2019ll read it by the slush-lamps in the station huts at night,\n\nI have seen the People\u2019s triumph in the visions of my dreams;\nIt as pictured by the campfires down the lonely western streams,\nAnd the teamsters talk about it as they tramp beside their teams.\n\nWrite the Truth in simple language, and you shall not write in vain!\nSing a ringing song of freedom, and you\u2019ll hear the same refrain\nWhere the drovers ride together far across the western plain.\n\nWrite of wrongs that you are hating with the grand old burning hate!\nFor the lonely digger reads it when the western day is late,\nAnd he marks it in the paper he is sending to his mate.\n\nSpread the Truth in simple language when you feel it in your breast!\nIt will reach the far selections in the wild Australian west,\nWhere the bushmen yarn together on a sunny day of rest.\n\nO the workers\u2019 new religion spreads beneath the southern skies,\nAnd the bearded fathers read it, for its words are kind and wise,\nAnd the little children listen to the Truth with wondering eyes."}
