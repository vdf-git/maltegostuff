{"subject": "The Shell And The World", "text": "The world was like a shell to me,-\nIts voice with distant song was low;\nBut now its mysteries I know:\nI hear the turmoil of the sea.\n\nThe whirling, soft, and tender sound\nThat meant I knew not what of lore,-\nI dream its mystery now no more:\nIts reckless meaning I have found.\n\nO shell! I held thee to my ears\nWhen I was young, and smiled with pride\nTo stand aglow at marvel's side!\nO world, thy voice is wild with tears!"}
