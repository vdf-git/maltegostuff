{"subject": "Sonnet C. In Dreamy Days Of Boyhood And Of Youth", "text": "In dreamy days of boyhood and of youth\nSweet Poesy whispered often in mine ear;\nAnd I could then with voice distinct and clear\nRepeat her ditties: but of late, in sooth,\nThe sterner mandates of unflattering Truth\nHave filled my hearing, making not less dear\nHigh strains of verse; but hallowing with fear\nMy thoughts and keen remorse, and backward ruth.\n\nTherefore farewell, ye pleasant melodies\nOf song, heroic, holy or pastoral:\nFarewell, ye shades and voiceful forests all;\nNo more along your sward--paths dark with trees\nShall wander he, who, lightly skilled to please,\nCould yet from leaf and rock poetic numbers call."}
