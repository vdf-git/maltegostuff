{"subject": "White And Black", "text": "The white man held the blacks as slaves,\nAnd bled their souls in living death;\nBishops and priests, and kings themselves,\nPreached that the law was right and just;\nAnd so the people worked and died,\nAnd crumbled into material dust.\nGood God! The scheme is just the same\nToday, between the black and white\nRaces of men, who gallop after fame.\nCan'st Thou not change this bloody thing,\nAnd make white people see the truth\nThat over blacks must be their king,\nNot white, but of their somber hue,\nTo rule a nation of themselves?"}
