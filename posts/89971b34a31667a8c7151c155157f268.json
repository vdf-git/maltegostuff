{"subject": "The Indian's Welcome To The Pilgrim Fathers", "text": "ABOVE them spread a stranger sky\nAround, the sterile plain,\nThe rock-bound coast rose frowning nigh,\nBeyond,--the wrathful main:\nChill remnants of the wintry snow\nStill chok'd the encumber'd soil,\nYet forth these Pilgrim Fathers go,\nTo mark their future toil.\n\n'Mid yonder vale their corn must rise\nIn Summer's ripening pride,\nAnd there the church-spire woo the skies\nIts sister-school beside.\nPerchance 'mid England's velvet green\nSome tender thought repos'd,--\nThough nought upon their stoic mien\nSuch soft regret disclos'd.\n\nWhen sudden from the forest wide\nA red-brow'd chieftain came,\nWith towering form, and haughty stride,\nAnd eye like kindling flame:\nNo wrath he breath'd, no conflict sought,\nTo no dark ambush drew,\nBut simply to the Old World brought,\nThe welcome of the New.\n\nThat welcome was a blast and ban\nUpon thy race unborn.\nWas there no seer, thou fated Man!\nThy lavish zeal to warn?\nThou in thy fearless faith didst hail\nA weak, invading band,\nBut who shall heed thy children's wail,\nSwept from their native land?\n\nThou gav'st the riches of thy streams,\nThe lordship o'er thy waves,\nThe region of thine infant dreams,\nAnd of thy fathers' graves,\nBut who to yon proud mansions pil'd\nWith wealth of earth and sea,\nPoor outcast from thy forest wild,\nSay, who shall welcome thee"}
