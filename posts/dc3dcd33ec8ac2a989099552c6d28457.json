{"subject": "The Old Tea-Clipper Days", "text": "I have sailed in old tea-clippers,\nFull rigged clippers, lofty, trim;\nBounding o'er the laughing waters\nWith the wind abaft the beam,\nAnd her lovely, snowy-white wings-\nAll a-pulling in the gale:\nNow behold, she rolls to leeward,\nNow she dips her weather rail.\n\nI can see her slanting wet decks,\nGreen with slime amidships too:\nI can hear old Bill, the bos'un\nCursing at our bully crew:\nI can see each hairy visage\nLaughing in the briny spray\nSwinging on the topsail halliards,\nSinging chanties wild and gay.\n\nOh! the rushing of the waters\nAs we haul and pull with glee,\nLashing, driving in our faces,\nFilling seaboots to the knee,\nWith our soul and body lashings\nHauled full taut around the waist,\nWhile the bos'un curse like thunder,\n'Damn your eyes! Belay! Make Haste!'\n\nWe have split the hardy pantiles\nWith our sheath-knives thro' and thro;\nAnd took out the crawling maggots\nEre we hashed them for the crew,\nWe have felt the pangs of hunger\nAs we made some cracker hash -\n'Dandy-funk' and 'Spotted Harry,'\nMixed with sugar brown, a dash.\n\nWe have tacked and ran before it,\nIn the roaring forties - well -\nWe have wallow'd in the Tropics\nWhere the sun's as hot as Hell!\nIn a stark and stinking blizzard,\nWe have weathered old Cape Horn;\nAnd we passed the 'Flying Dutchman'\nWith his topsails rent and torn."}
