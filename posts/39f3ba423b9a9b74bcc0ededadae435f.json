{"subject": "I Do Not Love Thee", "text": "I DO not love thee! - no! I do not love thee! \nAnd yet when thou art absent I am sad; \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And envy even the bright blue sky above thee, \nWhose quiet stars may see thee and be glad. \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I do not love thee! - yet, I know not why, \nWhate'er thou dost seems still well done, to me: \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And often in my solitude I sigh \nThat those I do love are not more like thee! \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I do not love thee! - yet, when thou art gone, \nI hate the sound (though those who speak be dear)  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Which breaks the lingering echo of the tone \nThy voice of music leaves upon my ear. \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I do not love thee! - yet thy speaking eyes, \nWith their deep, bright, and most expressive blue, \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Between me and the midnight heaven arise, \nOftener than any eyes I ever knew. \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I know I do not love thee! yet, alas! \nOthers will scarcely trust my candid heart; \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And oft I catch them smiling as they pass, \nBecause they see me gazing where thou art."}
