{"subject": "The American Flag", "text": "I. \n\nWHEN Freedom from her mountain height \nUnfurled her standard to the air, \nShe tore the azure robe of night, \nAnd set the stars of glory there. \nShe mingled with its gorgeous dyes \nThe milky baldric of the skies, \nAnd striped its pure celestial white, \nWith streakings of the morning light; \nThen from his mansion in the sun \nShe called her eagle bearer down, \nAnd gave into his mighty hand, \nThe symbol of her chosen land. \n\nII. \n\nMajestic monarch of the cloud, \nWho rear'st aloft thy regal form, \nTo hear the tempest trumpings loud \nAnd see the lightning lances driven, \nWhen strive the warriors of the storm, \nAnd rolls the thunder-drum of heaven, \nChild of the sun! to thee 'tis given \nTo guard the banner of the free, \nTo hover in the sulphur smoke, \nTo ward away the battle stroke, \nAnd bid its blendings shine afar, \nLike rainbows on the cloud of war, \nThe harbingers of victory! \n\nIII. \n\nFlag of the brave! thy folds shall fly, \nThe sign of hope and triumph high, \nWhen speaks the signal trumpet tone, \nAnd the long line comes gleaming on. \nEre yet the life-blood, warm and wet, \nHas dimm'd the glistening bayonet, \nEach soldier eye shall brightly turn \nTo where thy sky-born glories burn; \nAnd as his springing steps advance, \nCatch war and vengeance from the glance. \nAnd when the cannon-mouthings loud \nHeave in wild wreaths the battle shroud, \nAnd gory sabres rise and fall \nLike shoots of flame on midnight's pall; \nThen shall thy meteor glances glow, \nAnd cowering foes shall shrink beneath \nEach gallant arm that strikes below \nThat lovely messenger of death. \n\nIV. \n\nFlag of the seas! on ocean wave \nThy stars shall glitter o'er the brave; \nWhen death, careering on the gale, \nSweeps darkly round the bellied sail, \nAnd frighted waves rush wildly back \nBefore the broadside's reeling rack, \nEach dying wanderer of the sea \nShall look at once to heaven and thee, \nAnd smile to see thy splendours fly \nIn triumph o'er his closing eye. \n\nV. \n\nFlag of the free heart's hope and home! \nBy angel hands to valour given; \nThe stars have lit the welkin dome, \nAnd all thy hues were born in heaven. \nFor ever float that standard sheet! \nWhere breathes the foe but falls before us, \nWith Freedom's soil beneath our feet, \nAnd Freedom's banner streaming o'er us?"}
