{"subject": "The Old King's New Jester", "text": "You that in vain would front the coming order \nWith eyes that meet forlornly what they must, \nAnd only with a furtive recognition \nSee dust where there is dust,\u2014 \nBe sure you like it always in your faces,\nObscuring your best graces, \nBlinding your speech and sight, \nBefore you seek again your dusty places \nWhere the old wrong seems right. \n\nLonger ago than cave-men had their changes\nOur fathers may have slain a son o two, \nDiscouraging a further dialectic \nRegarding what was new; \nAnd after their unstudied admonition \nOccasional contrition\nFor their old-fashioned ways \nMay have reduced their doubts, and in addition \nSoftened their final days. \n\nFarther away than feet shall ever travel. \nAre the vague towers of our unbuilded State;\nBut there are mightier things than we to lead us, \nThat will not let us wait. \nAnd we go on with none to tell us whether \nOr not we\u2019ve each a tether \nDetermining how fast or how far we go;\nAnd it is well, since we must go together, \nThat we are not to know. \n\nIf the old wrong and all its injured glamour \nHaunts you by day and gives your night no peace, \nYou may as well, agreeably and serenely,\nGive the new wrong its lease; \nFor should you nourish a too fervid yearning \nFor what is not returning, \nThe vicious and unfused ingredient \nMay give you qualms\u2014and one or two concerning\nThe last of your content."}
