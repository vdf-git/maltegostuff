{"subject": "Xxxiv. _Love's Furnace._", "text": "S\u00ec amico al freddo sasso.\n\nSo friendly is the fire to flinty stone,\nThat, struck therefrom and kindled to a blaze,\nIt burns the stone, and from the ash doth raise\nWhat lives thenceforward binding stones in one:\nKiln-hardened this resists both frost and sun,\nAcquiring higher worth for endless days-\nAs the purged soul from hell returns with praise,\nAmid the heavenly host to take her throne.\nE'en so the fire struck from my soul, that lay\nClose-hidden in my heart, may temper me,\nTill burned and slaked to better life I rise.\nIf, made mere smoke and dust, I live to-day,\nFire-hardened I shall live eternally;\nSuch gold, not iron, my spirit strikes and tries."}
