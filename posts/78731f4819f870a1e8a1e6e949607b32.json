{"subject": "A Tribute From The Poet", "text": "Allahu Akbar! \nAllahu Akbar! \nFrom Allah comes today\nRahmat, Kauthar.\nThose of whom Allah is patron\nThis victory is of them,\nIt is the victory of God's Will,\nNot for our vain fame.\n\nIt is a victory, but\nMerely the stepping stone, no more; \nFrom so much bondage-affliction\nToward above we have to soar.\n\nSo much division, schism\nJealousy, greed and arrogance,\nAll these will simply disappear\nWith His one merciful glance.\n\nYou are the new travelers\nYou are bound toward Him,\nFollowing your footsteps\nHere comes a heavenly beam.\n\nYes, coming are the travelers\nYoung warriors of new age,\nSoon world's misery and suffering\nWill be confined in their cage."}
