{"subject": "Harvard Ode Iv", "text": "There's a fountain of Fable whose magical power\nTime's ravages all could repair,\nAnd replace the bowed form and the tottering step,\nThe wrinkles and silvery hair,\nBy the brown flowing locks and the graces of youth,\nIts footstep elastic and light,\nCould mantle the cheek with its long-vanished bloom\nAnd make the dull eye keen and bright.\n\n'Tis only a fable-a beautiful dream,\nBut the fable, the dream, shall come true,\nAs thy sons, Alma Mater, assemble to-night\nThe joys of past years to renew.\nOur eyes shall grow bright with their old wonted light,\nOur spirits untrammelled by care,\nAnd the Goddess of Hope, with her fresh rainbow tints,\nShall paint every prospect more fair.\n\nHow sweet were the friendships we formed in thy halls!\nHow strong were the tendrils that bound\nOur hearts to the mother whose provident care\nEncompassed her children around!\nNow strong in our manhood we cherish her still;\nAnd if by misfortune brought low,\nOur strength shall support her, our arms bear her up,\nAnd sustain her through weal and through woe."}
