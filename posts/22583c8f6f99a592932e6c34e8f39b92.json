{"subject": "Life Of The Dead", "text": "When over us the cross its shadow throws,\nOur frames enshrouded in the mould of night,\nThy body shall reflower in lily white,\nAnd from my flesh be born the ensanguined rose.\n\nAnd Death divine, thy verse in music knows,\nWith silence and oblivion to his flight,\nIn heavens shall show us, lulled with gentle might,\nEchanted route where strange, new stars repose.\n\nAnd mounting to the sun, within his breast\nOur spirits twain shall melt and be possessed\nOf blessedness of everlasting fire;\n\nBut Fame, anointing friend and child of song,\nShall give us an eternal life among\nThe immortal Shades made kin by glorious Lyre."}
