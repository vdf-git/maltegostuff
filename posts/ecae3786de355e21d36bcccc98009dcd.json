{"subject": "Descent To The Light", "text": "The night is my return. I go over the museum of absence. \n\nAll suffering is useless for those who do not pursue poetry, for those who do not feed eagles with their eyes. \n\nI exercise thirst. I only love those whom I could not save. \n\nThere is no longer a darkness to guide our dreams or the phantoms of inconclusive desire; only the abject exchange that has replaced ritual. \n\nI do not seek, I lose . . .\n\nAnd I don't even find a place for astonishment. \n\nI can no longer forget. Nor do I pretend to know the three answers hidden by death. \n\nHere nobody lacks the necessary hatred to recover paradise, or confess its rude fall during the day. \n\nIt must be shadow or shout. Return or birth. \n\nEvery origin will decree the abolition of the ego. \n\nIt is then that breathing will be green. \n\nAnd even though I owe everything to pain . . . I advance, I fall. I choose the ways that have no end. Voices burn out darkness. The poem. \n\nYou know it, quivering body: \n\nIt is not in time where I have put my words.\n\nTranslation: 2008, Nicol\u00e1s Suesc\u00fan"}
