{"subject": "On Don Surly", "text": "Don Surly, to aspire the glorious name\n\u00a0Of a great man, and to be thought the same,\nMakes serious use of all great trade he know.\n\u00a0He speaks to men with a Rhinocerotes' nose,\nWhich he thinks great; and so reads verses too,\n\u00a0And that is done as he saw great men do.\nHe has timpanies of business in his face,\n\u00a0And can forget men's names with a great grace.\nHe will both argue and discourse in oaths,\n\u00a0Both which are great; and laugh at ill-made clothes-\nThat's greater yet-to cry his own up neat.\n\u00a0He doth, at meals, alone his pheasant eat,\nWhich is main greatness; and at his still board\n\u00a0He drinks to no man; that's, too, like a lord.\nHe keeps another's wife, which is a spice\n\u00a0Of solemn greatness. And he dares, at dice,\nBlaspheme God greatly, or some poor hind beat\n\u00a0That breathes in his dog's way; and this is great.\nNay more, for greatness' sake, he will be one\n\u00a0May hear my epigrams, but like of none,\nSurly, use other arts; these only can\n\u00a0Style thee a most great fool, but no great man."}
