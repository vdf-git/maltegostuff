{"subject": "The Old Dust", "text": "The living is a passing traveler;\nThe dead, a man come home.\nOne brief journey betwixt heaven and earth,\nThen, alas! we are the same old dust of ten thousand ages.\nThe rabbit in the moon pounds the medicine in vain;\nFu-sang, the tree of immortality, has crumbled to kindling wood.\nMan dies, his white bones are dumb without a word\nWhen the green pines feel the coming of the spring.\nLooking back, I sigh; looking before, I sigh again.\nWhat is there to prize in the life's vaporous glory?"}
