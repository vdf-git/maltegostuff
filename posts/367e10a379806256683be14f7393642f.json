{"subject": "Ode Xv: To The Evening-Star", "text": "I.\nTo-night retir'd the queen of heaven\nWith young Endymion stays:\nAnd now to Hesper is it given\nAwhile to rule the vacant sky,\nTill she shall to her lamp supply\nA stream of brighter rays.\n\nII.\nO Hesper, while the starry throng\nWith awe thy path surrounds,\nOh listen to my suppliant song,\nIf haply now the vocal sphere\nCan suffer thy delighted ear\nTo stoop to mortal sounds.\n\nIII.\nSo may the bridegroom's genial strain\nThee still invoke to shine:\nSo may the bride's unmarried train\nTo Hymen chaunt their flattering vow,\nStill that his lucky torch may glow\nWith lustre pure as thine.\n\nIV.\nFar other vows must i prefer\nTo thy indulgent power.\nAlass, but now i paid my tear\nOn fair Olympia's virgin tomb:\nAnd lo, from thence, in quest i roam\nOf Philomela's bower.\n\nV.\nPropitious send thy golden ray,\nThou purest light above:\nLet no false flame seduce to stray\nWhere gulph or steep lie hid for harm:\nBut lead where music's healing charm\nMay sooth afflicted love.\n\nVI.\nTo them, by many a grateful song\nIn happier seasons vow'd,\nThese lawns, Olympia's haunt, belong:\nOft by yon silver stream we walk'd,\nOr fix'd, while Philomela talk'd,\nBeneath yon copses stood.\n\nVII.\nNor seldom, where the beachen boughs\nThat roofless tower invade,\nWe came while her inchanting Muse\nThe radiant moon above us held:\nTill by a clamorous owl compell'd\nShe fled the solemn shade.\n\nVIII.\nBut hark; I hear her liquid tone.\nNow, Hesper, guide my feet\nDown the red marle with moss o'ergrown,\nThrough yon wild thicket next the plain,\nWhose hawthorns choke the winding lane\nWhich leads to her retreat.\n\nIX.\nSee the green space: on either hand\nInlarg'd it spreads around:\nSee, in the midst she takes her stand,\nWhere one old oak his awful shade\nExtends o'er half the level mead\nInclos'd in woods profound.\n\nX.\nHark, how through many a melting note\nShe now prolongs her lays:\nHow sweetly down the void they float!\nThe breeze their magic path attends:\nThe stars shine out: the forest bends:\nThe wakeful heifers gaze.\n\nXI.\nWhoe'er thou art whom chance may bring\nTo this sequester'd spot,\nIf then the plaintive Syren sing,\nOh softly tread beneath her bower,\nAnd think of heaven's disposing power,\nOf man's uncertain lot.\n\nXII.\nOh think, o'er all this mortal stage,\nWhat mournful scenes arise:\nWhat ruin waits on kingly rage:\nHow often virtue dwells with woe:\nHow many griefs from knowledge flow:\nHow swiftly pleasure flies.\n\nXIII.\nO sacred bird, let me at eve,\nThus wandering all alone,\nThy tender counsel oft receive,\nBear witness to thy pensive airs,\nAnd pity nature's common cares\nTill i forget my own."}
