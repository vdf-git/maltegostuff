{"subject": "Lost Meanings", "text": "In mangled bodies\nand severed limbs, \nthe blood gives up its claim.\n\nA twisted window blocks the landscape\nof silvered faces.\nNo body talks with moon.\n\nNight burns the fat\nfloats on the dead mouthings.\nDeath has the foulest taste.\n\nDarkness looms overnight, \nvery false under the lamp, \neyelids are closing.\n\nDirty maps unfold the mystery\nof religion. The longest book\nhas the restless words."}
