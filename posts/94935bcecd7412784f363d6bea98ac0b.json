{"subject": "Guests", "text": "I do not know how to be skilled\nIn leading your sparrows\nTo the water in the loneliness of remote night\nAnd in leading your birds to the fragrant flowers\nIn the loneliness of a stump-nosed night.\nI used to have a waste memory\nAnd an impromptu sky.\nBut when you left away\nHow had you left the stone cottage' door\nOpen for the coward tiger,\nThe drunken lark,\nAnd the head-severed lion?"}
