{"subject": "As I Ganged By The Luckenbooths", "text": "As I ganged by the Luckenbooths I saw a lady fair,\nShe had lang pendles in her ears and jewels in her hair,\nAnd when she cam tae oor hoose she spiered at wha was ben,\n'O hae ye seen my lost love, wi his braw Hieland men?'\n\nThe smile about her bonny face was sweeter than the bee,\nHer voice was like the lintie's sang aboon the birken tree,\nBut when the minister cam oot her mare began tae prance,\nAnd rade intae the sunset - beyont the coast o France."}
