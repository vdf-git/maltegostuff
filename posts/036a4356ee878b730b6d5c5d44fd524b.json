{"subject": "Hymn #5", "text": "MY soul! and dost thou faintly shrink,\nThus trembling on an awful brink?\nOr rough or smooth, but one step more,\nAnd thy long pilgrimage is o'er.\nThy pilgrim's cloak that clipped thee round,\nLike a seared leaf, dropped on the ground,\nA base and mouldering thing shall lie,\nIts form and uses all gone by.\nBehind thee, closing darkness all\nShall cover, like a midnight pall,\nBefore thee--No! I may not dare\nTo think, or fancy, what lies there.--\nDoth the unbodied spirit take its flight,\nUnto its destined, distant, sphere of light,\nUpon the buoyant wings of morn,\nAll conscious of its glory borne?\nOr with an instant transit, make\nThe awful change, and then awake,\nAs from a slumber, sound and deep,\nAwakes an Infant from its sleep,\nWith limbs refreshed and vigour new,\nA gradual progress to pursue?\nAllied to Infancy, with earthly charms,\nOnce fondled in an elder brother's arms,\nWho said to men, by worldly passions driven,\n'Lo! such as these possess the realms of heaven.'\nOr shall it powerful, and at once\nStart up as from a gloomy trance,\nWith sudden, glorious light astounded,\nBy the blest brotherhood of saints surrounded,\nWhere those, who have been loved and lost, appear\nWith kindred looks of greeting and of cheer?\nAway, ye pictured thoughts that pass\nLike figures on a magic glass,\nOr fitful light with arrowy rays\nThat on the northern welkin plays!\nA steady gleam that will not flit,\nComes from the words of Holy Writ.\n'Eye hath not seen, and ear hath never heard,\nNor heart conceived the things by God prepared,\nFor those who love him.'--O such love impart,\nRepentant, fervent and adoring,\nFrom every taint of sin restoring,\nMy Father and my God! to this poor heart!"}
