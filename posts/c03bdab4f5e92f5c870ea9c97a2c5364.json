{"subject": "Paradise Motel", "text": "Millions were dead; everybody was innocent.\nI stayed in my room. The President\nSpoke of war as of a magic love potion.\nMy eyes were opened in astonishment.\nIn a mirror my face appeared to me\nLike a twice-canceled postage stamp.\n\nI lived well, but life was awful.\nthere were so many soldiers that day,\nSo many refugees crowding the roads.\nNaturally, they all vanished\nWith a touch of the hand.\nHistory licked the corners of its bloody mouth.\n\nOn the pay channel, a man and a woman\nWere trading hungry kisses and tearing off\nEach other's clothes while I looked on\nWith the sound off and the room dark\nExcept for the screen where the color\nHad too much red in it, too much pink."}
