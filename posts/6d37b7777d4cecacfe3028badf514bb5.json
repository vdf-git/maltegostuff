{"subject": "The Believer's Danger, Safety, And Duty", "text": "Simon, beware! the Saviour said,\nSatan, your subtle foe,\nAlready has his measures laid\nYour soul to overthrow. \n\nHe wants to sift you all, as wheat,\nAnd thinks his vict'ry sure;\nBut I his malice will defeat,\nMy prayer shall faith secure. \n\nBelievers, tremble and rejoice,\nYour help and danger view;\nThis warning has to you a voice,\nThis promise speaks to you. \n\nSatan beholds, with jealous eye,\nYour privilege and joy;\nHe's always watchful, always nigh,\nTo tear and to destroy. \n\nBut Jesus lives to intercede,\nThat faith may still prevail,\nHe will support in time of need,\nAnd Satan's arts shall fail. \n\nYet, let us not the warning slight,\nBut watchful still be found;\nThough faith cannot be slain in fight,\nIt may receive a wound. \n\nWhile Satan watches, dare we sleep?\nWe must our guard maintain;\nBut, Lord, do thou the city keep,\nOr else we watch in vain."}
