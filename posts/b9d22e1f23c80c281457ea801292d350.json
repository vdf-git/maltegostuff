{"subject": "Life To Death Of A Captive Circus Tiger", "text": "Whatever I did is no privacy, \nBecause they never cared what I feel.\nI had been captured and been sacked, \nNow they made me to sit still! \n\nDays to nights to weeks to years of dreadful, \nWere all meaning less to the devils.\nEach time they made me sit still, \nWas another thing loss in my will.\n\nDeadly sounds and evil lights, \nKept me prisoner all the night.\nI couldn't believe I'm forbidden to sleep, \nAfter they took everything from me.\n\nAfter years of this, \nMy life's strength had quit.\nSickness and death invade, \nBut to the devil's it's like another fly disintegrate.\n\nPain rushed through me, \nEvery second I lost a big chunk of my energy to live.\nVomit and faint became my ally, \nAt last one day my fate had been decided."}
