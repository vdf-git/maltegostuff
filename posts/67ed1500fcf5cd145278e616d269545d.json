{"subject": "Pastoral", "text": "Something in the field is\nworking away. Root-noise.\nTwig-noise. Plant\nof weak chlorophyll, no\nname for it. Something\nin the field has mastered\ndistance by living too close\nto fences. Yellow fruit, has it\npit or seeds? Stalk of wither. Grass-\nnoise fighting weed-noise. Dirt\nand chant. Something in the\nfield. Coreopsis. I did not mean\nto say that. Yellow petal, has it\nwither-gift? Has it gorgeous\nrash? Leaf-loss and worried\nsprout, its bursting art. Some-\nthing in the. Field fallowed and\ncicada. I did not mean to\nsay. Has it roar and bloom?\nHas it road and follow? A thistle\nprick, fraught burrs, such\neasy attachment. Stem-\nand stamen-noise. Can I lime-\nflower? Can I chamomile?\nSomething in the field cannot."}
