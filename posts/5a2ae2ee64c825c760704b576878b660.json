{"subject": "At The Graves in Memory", "text": "The land there rolls no more than the quiet river \nCurves. Drifts of pine straw resin the ground. \nSummer is remembered like a wild fever\n\nThat left the forehead when the sun went down. \nThat February day was mild as Easter. \nThere to the west of my abandoned town,\n\nShirt-sleeved gravediggers smoked at a corner \nOf lawn unbroken by an upright stone. \nSoft wind in the pines, the sound of water\n\nStilled in memory, the merciful brief drone \nOf the old liturgy, and it was over. \nMy mother's body by my father's bones.\n\nWinter. Easter weather. Long gone life-givers. \nThe land there rolls no more than the quiet river."}
