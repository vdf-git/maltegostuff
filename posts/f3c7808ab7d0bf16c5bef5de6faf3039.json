{"subject": "The Fountain", "text": "Traveller! on thy journey toiling\nBy the swift Powow,\nWith the summer sunshine falling\nOn thy heated brow,\nListen, while all else is still,\nTo the brooklet from the hill.\n\nWild and sweet the flowers are blowing\nBy that streamlet's side,\nAnd a greener verdure showing\nWhere its waters glide,\nDown the hill-slope murmuring on,\nOver root and mossy stone.\n\nWhere yon oak his broad arms flingeth\nO'er the sloping hill,\nBeautiful and freshly springeth\nThat soft-flowing rill,\nThrough its dark roots wreathed and bare,\nGushing up to sun and air.\n\nBrighter waters sparkled never\nIn that magic well,\nOf whose gift of life forever\nAncient legends tell,\nIn the lonely desert wasted,\nAnd by mortal lip untasted.\n\nWaters which the proud Castilian\nSought with longing eyes,\nUnderneath the bright pavilion\nOf the Indian skies,\nWhere his forest pathway lay\nThrough the blooms of Florida.\n\nYears ago a lonely stranger,\nWith the dusky brow\nOf the outcast forest-ranger,\nCrossed the swift Powow,\nAnd betook him to the rill\nAnd the oak upon the hill.\n\nO'er his face of moody sadness\nFor an instant shone\nSomething like a gleam of gladness,\nAs he stooped him down\nTo the fountain's grassy side,\nAnd his eager thirst supplied.\n\nWith the oak its shadow throwing\nO'er his mossy seat,\nAnd the cool, sweet waters flowing\nSoftly at his feet,\nClosely by the fountain's rim\nThat lone Indian seated him.\n\nAutumn's earliest frost had given\nTo the woods below\nHues of beauty, such as heaven\nLendeth to its bow;\nAnd the soft breeze from the west\nScarcely broke their dreamy rest.\n\nFar behind was Ocean striving\nWith his chains of sand;\nSouthward, sunny glimpses giving,\n'Twixt the swells of land,\nOf its calm and silvery track,\nRolled the tranquil Merrimac.\n\nOver village, wood, and meadow\nGazed that stranger man,\nSadly, till the twilight shadow\nOver all things ran,\nSave where spire and westward pane\nFlashed the sunset back again.\n\nGazing thus upon the dwelling\nOf his warrior sires,\nWhere no lingering trace was telling\nOf their wigwam fires,\nWho the gloomy thoughts might know\nOf that wandering child of woe?\n\nNaked lay, in sunshine glowing,\nHills that once had stood\nDown their sides the shadows throwing\nOf a mighty wood,\nWhere the deer his covert kept,\nAnd the eagle's pinion swept!\n\nWhere the birch canoe had glided\nDown the swift Powow,\nDark and gloomy bridges strided\nThose clear waters now;\nAnd where once the beaver swam,\nJarred the wheel and frowned the dam.\n\nFor the wood-bird's merry singing,\nAnd the hunter's cheer,\nIron clang and hammer's ringing\nSmote upon his ear;\nAnd the thick and sullen smoke\nFrom the blackened forges broke.\n\nCould it be his fathers ever\nLoved to linger here?\nThese bare hills, this conquered river,-\nCould they hold them dear,\nWith their native loveliness\nTamed and tortured into this?\n\nSadly, as the shades of even\nGathered o'er the hill,\nWhile the western half of heaven\nBlushed with sunset still,\nFrom the fountain's mossy seat\nTurned the Indian's weary feet.\n\nYear on year hath flown forever,\nBut he came no more\nTo the hillside on the river\nWhere he came before.\nBut the villager can tell\nOf that strange man's visit well.\n\nAnd the merry children, laden\nWith their fruits or flowers,\nRoving boy and laughing maiden,\nIn their school-day hours,\nLove the simple tale to tell\nOf the Indian and his well."}
