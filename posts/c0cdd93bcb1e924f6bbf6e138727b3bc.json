{"subject": "I Have A Musical Name", "text": "Maybe the window I sat by\nforetold an unusual glory.\nI wrote on my notebooks:\nIman\u2026\nA student at: The Iman Mersal Elementary School.\nNeither the teacher's stick \nnor the laughs that leapt from the back desks\ncould make me give up on the matter.\n\nI thought of naming our street after me\nbut only if the houses on it were widened \nand secret rooms were built\nfor my girlfriends to smoke in their beds\nwithout their older brothers catching them.\n\nMaybe the doors can be painted orange\nas an expression of joy.\nSmall holes can be drilled through them \nto allow anyone to spy on the large families.\nMaybe then no one will be lonely on our street.\n\n\"Pioneering experiments\nare shaped by great minds,\"\nthis is how passersby might describe me\nas they stroll the white sidewalks\nof a street bearing my name.\nBut because of an old animosity between us\u2014\nits stones had left marks on my knees\u2014\nI decided that my old street isn't worth it.\n\nI don't remember when I discovered that I have\na musical name suitable for autographing \nmetered poems and for flying\nbefore the faces of friends who have ordinary names\nand who do not understand the significance \nof being granted a dubious name\nthat raises suspicions about you\nand that makes you want to become someone else\nso that new acquaintances might ask:\nAre you Christian?\nor\nDo you have Lebanese roots?\n\nUnfortunately, something happened. \nWhen someone now calls out my name\nI get confused and look around me.\nIs it possible for a body like mine\nand a chest whose breathing is getting raspier\nwith each day to have such a name?\nI look at myself often\ncrossing from the bedroom to the bathroom\nwhere I do not have a whale's stomach\nto get rid of what I can't digest.\n\nTranslated from the Arabic by\nKhaled Mattawa"}
