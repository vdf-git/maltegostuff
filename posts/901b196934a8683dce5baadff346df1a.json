{"subject": "With Deaths' Prophetic Ear", "text": "Lay my rifle here beside me, set my Bible on my breast, \n  For a moment let the warning bugles cease; \nAs the century is closing I am going to my rest, \n  Lord, lettest Thou Thy servant go in peace. \nBut loud through all the bugles rings a cadence in mine ear, \n  And on the winds my hopes of peace are strowed. \nThose winds that waft the voices that already I can hear \n  Of the rooi-baatjes singing on the road. \n\nYes, the red-coats are returning, I can hear the steady tramp, \n  After twenty years of waiting, lulled to sleep, \nSince rank and file at Potchefstroom we hemmed them in their camp, \n  And cut them up at Bronkerspruit like sheep. \nThey shelled us at Ingogo, but we galloped into range, \n  And we shot the British gunners where they showed. \nI guessed they would return to us, I knew the chance must change -- \n  Hark! the rooi-baatjes singing on the road! \n\nBut now from snow-swept Canada, from India's torrid plains, \n  From lone Australian outposts, hither led, \nObeying their commando, as they heard the bugle's strains, \n  The men in brown have joined the men in red. \nThey come to find the colours at Majuba left and lost, \n  They come to pay us back the debt they owed; \nAnd I hear new voices lifted, and I see strange colours tossed, \n  'Mid the rooi-baatjes singing on the road. \n\nThe old, old faiths must falter, and the old, old creeds must fail -- \n  I hear it in that distant murmur low -- \nThe old, old order changes, and 'tis vain for us to rail, \n  The great world does not want us -- we must go. \nAnd veldt, and spruit, and kopje to the stranger will belong, \n  No more to trek before him we shall load; \nToo well, too well, I know it, for I hear it in the song \n  Of the rooi-baatjes singing on the road."}
