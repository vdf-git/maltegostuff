{"subject": "The Strong Heroic Line", "text": "FRIENDS of the Muse, to you of right belong\nThe first staid footsteps of my square-toed song;\nFull well I know the strong heroic line\nHas lost its fashion since I made it mine;\nBut there are tricks old singers will not learn, \nAnd this grave measure still must serve my turn.\nSo the old bird resumes the selfsame note\nHis first young summer wakened in his throat;\nThe selfsame tune the old canary sings,\nAnd all unchanged the bobolink\u2019s carol rings; \nWhen the tired songsters of the day are still\nThe thrush repeats his long-remembered trill;\nAge alters not the crow\u2019s persistent caw,\nThe Yankee\u2019s \u201cHaow,\u201d the stammering Briton\u2019s \u201cHaw;\u201d\nAnd so the hand that takes the lyre for you \nPlays the old tune on strings that once were new.\nNor let the rhymester of the hour deride\nThe straight-backed measure with its stately stride:\nIt gave the mighty voice of Dryden scope;\nIt sheathed the steel-bright epigrams of Pope; \nIn Goldsmith\u2019s verse it learned a sweeter strain;\nByron and Campbell wore its clanking chain;\nI smile to listen while the critic\u2019s scorn\nFlouts the proud purple kings have nobly worn;\nBid each new rhymer try his dainty skill \nAnd mould his frozen phrases as he will;\nWe thank the artist for his neat device;\nThe shape is pleasing, though the stuff is ice.\n\nFashions will change\u2014the new costume allures,\nUnfading still the better type endures; \nWhile the slashed doublet of the cavalier\nGave the old knight the pomp of chanticleer,\nOur last-hatched dandy with his glass and stick\nRecalls the semblance of a new-born chick;\n(To match the model he is aiming at \nHe ought to wear an eggshell for a hat).\nHe ought to wear an eggshell for a hat).\nWhich of these objects would a painter choose,\nAnd which Velasquez or Van Dyck refuse?"}
