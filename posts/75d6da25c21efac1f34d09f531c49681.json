{"subject": "And Do You Think That Love Itself", "text": "And do you think that love itself,\nLiving in such an ugly house,\nCan prosper long?\n            \t\tWe meet and part;\nOur talk is all of heres and nows,\nOur conduct likewise; in no act\nIs any future, any past;\nUnder our sly, unspoken pact,\nI KNOW with whom I saw you last,\nBut I say nothing; and you know\nAt six-fifteen to whom I go\u2014 \nCan even love be treated so?\n\nI KNOW, but I do not insist,\nHaving stealth and tact, thought not enough,\nWhat hour your eye is on your wrist.\n\nNo wild appeal, no mild rebuff\nDeflates the hour, leaves the wine flat\u2014 \n\nYet if YOU drop the picked-up book\nTo intercept my clockward look\u2014 \nTell me, can love go on like that?\n\nEven the bored, insulted heart,\nThat signed so long and tight a lease,\nCan BREAK it CONTRACT, slump in peace."}
