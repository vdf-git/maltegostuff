{"subject": "Agni, Or The Fire", "text": "1.\nLighted Agni flames forth high,\nFlings a radiance on the sky,\nAnd his lustre, glorious, bright,\nMingles with the morning light.\nAnd Visvav\u00e2r\u00e2 chants her holy prayer,\nFaces the east, and brings her gifts to Fire! \n\n2.\nLord of Eternity! Lord of skies! \nPresiding Lord of sacrifice! \nAgni! Whoso worships thee,\nBy him with thy blessings be! \nWhose blazing altar sacred Agni lights, -\nAffluence dwells with him and pious rites.\n\n3.\nAgni! On the altar shine,\nFlames and radiance bright be thine! \nGrant us wealth with thy red flame,\nQuell our foes, increase our fame! \nInvest our homes with blessings from above,\nAnd link our men and wives in bonds of love! \n\n4.\nAgni! On the altar shine,\nFlames and radiance bright be thine! \nAnd I lift my pious hymn\nTo thy bright effulgent beam! \nBounteous god! Red lustre e'er be thine,\nFlame on our altar, glorious and divine! \n\n5.\nWith pious hands we light thy flame,\nWith pious lips we chant thy name! \nInvoke unto our sacrifice\nThe glorious bright gods of the skies! \nFor thou art Priest in every pious rite,\nAnd makest gifts to gods with radiance bright! \n\n6.\nThen let us unto Agni pray,\nAnd he our offerings will convey! \nAnd let us unto Agni sing,\nAnd he the radiant gods will bring! \nPriest and God! to thee we humbly pray,\nOur pious offerings to the gods convey!"}
