{"subject": "A Song", "text": "Sweet dreams, form a shade\n O'er my lovely infant's head!\n Sweet dreams of pleasant streams\n By happy, silent, moony beams!\n\n Sweet Sleep, with soft down\n Weave thy brows an infant crown\n Sweet Sleep, angel mild,\n Hover o'er my happy child!\n\n Sweet smiles, in the night\n Hover over my delight!\n Sweet smiles, mother's smile,\n All the livelong night beguile.\n\n Sweet moans, dovelike sighs,\n Chase not slumber from thine eyes!\n Sweet moan, sweeter smile,\n All the dovelike moans beguile.\n\n Sleep, sleep, happy child!\n All creation slept and smiled.\n Sleep, sleep, happy sleep,\n While o'er thee doth mother weep.\n\n Sweet babe, in thy face\n Holy image I can trace;\n Sweet babe, once like thee\n Thy Maker lay, and wept for me:\n\n Wept for me, for thee, for all,\n When He was an infant small.\n Thou His image ever see,\n Heavenly face that smiles on thee!\n\n Smiles on thee, on me, on all,\n Who became an infant small;\n Infant smiles are his own smiles;\n Heaven and earth to peace beguiles."}
