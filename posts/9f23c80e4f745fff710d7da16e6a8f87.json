{"subject": "Pauline Barrett", "text": "Almost the shell of a woman after the surgeon's knife!\nAnd almost a year to creep back into strength,\nTill the dawn of our wedding decennial\nFound me my seeming self again.\nWe walked the forest together,\nBy a path of soundless moss and turf.\nBut I could not look in your eyes,\nAnd you could not look in my eyes,\nFor such sorrow was ours -- the beginning of gray in your hair,\nAnd I but a shell of myself.\nAnd what did we talk of? -- sky and water,\nAnything, 'most, to hide our thoughts.\nAnd then your gift of wild roses,\nSet on the table to grace our dinner.\nPoor heart, how bravely you struggled\nTo imagine and live a remembered rapture!\nThen my spirit drooped as the night came on,\nAnd you left me alone in my room for a while,\nAs you did when I was a bride, poor heart.\nAnd I looked in the mirror and something said:\n\"One should be all dead when one is half-dead --\nNor ever mock life, nor ever cheat love.\"\nAnd I did it looking there in the mirror --\nDear, have you ever understood?"}
