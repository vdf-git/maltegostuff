{"subject": "Evening Mood...", "text": "Moonlight, you spread your silvers onto us \nAnd lead us to dreams by your soft whispers-- \nUnspoken whispers--that's heard by the hearts-- \nPoetic hearts--love-searching and tender. \nAnd this park--now is empty and dreamy-- \nEven the night-roaming lovers have gone-- \nOnly the late cold air left lulling me-- \nWas once filled with some sweetly chanted songs, \nSung into the heart of a sweet lover, \nWhose skin pale as the silver light of Moon \nAnd cold as the evening breeze of Winter, \nYet her heart warm and temper mild as June. \nAnd now she is smiling down from Heaven \nAs I sing to her from our love's garden."}
