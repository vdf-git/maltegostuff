{"subject": "The Song Of Life", "text": "Sing not of Rest\nFor heart, or brain, or the strong soul\u2019s emotion\nBeneath the shadow of Eternal peace!\nThere is no rest in Nature or surcease\nOf Law, and Labour, in unceasing motion.\nSing not of Rest! \nSing not of Peace\nOn earth, or in the realms beyond our dreaming!\nProgress and Retrogression all things draw\nWithin the edict of Eternal Law.\nSearch for the Real which lies beneath the Seeming.\nSing not of Peace \n\nSing thou of Toil,\nOf toil that moulds to-day the larger morrow!\nMove with stout heart on Life\u2019s great battle-field\nAnd wear the motto \u201cProgress\u201d on thy shield.\nAll that is best is won through toil and sorrow.\nSing thou of Toil! \n\nSing thou of Hope!\nOf Hope that lights the world to strong endeavour!\nHeight beyond height but loftier summits show,\nDepth beneath depth reveals a depth below.\nChoose thou the best. There is no resting ever.\nSing thou of Hope! \n\nSing thou of Truth!\nThat which alone can stand when all is sifted;\nThat which Humanity in pain and tears\nHas sought with patient toil through myriad years,\nTill thou shalt see with radiant face uplifted\nEternal Truth."}
