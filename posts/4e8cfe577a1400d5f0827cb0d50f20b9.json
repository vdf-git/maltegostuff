{"subject": "Galatea Encore", "text": "As though the mercury's under its tongue, it won't \ntalk. As though with the mercury in its sphincter, \nimmobile, by a leaf-coated pond \na statue stands white like a blight of winter. \nAfter such snow, there is nothing indeed: the ins \nand outs of centuries, pestered heather. \nThat's what coming full circle means - \nwhen your countenance starts to resemble weather, \nwhen Pygmalion's vanished. And you are free \nto cloud your folds, to bare the navel. \nFuture at last! That is, bleached debris \nof a glacier amid the five-lettered \"never.\" \nHence the routine of a goddess, nee \nalabaster, that lets roving pupils gorge on \nthe heart of color and the temperature of the knee. \nThat's what it looks like inside a virgin."}
