{"subject": "Why Not Do It, Sir, Today?", "text": "'Why so I will, you noisy bird,\nThis very day I'll advertise you,\nPerhaps some busy ones may prize you.\nA fine-tongued parrot as was ever heard,\nI'll word it thus-set forth all charms about you,\nAnd say no family should be without you.'\nThus far a gentleman addressed a bird,\nThen to his friend: 'An old procrastinator,\nSir, I am: do you wonder that I hate her?\nThough she but seven words can say,\nTwenty and twenty times a day\nShe interferes with all my dreams,\nMy projects, plans, and airy schemes,\nMocking my foible to my sorrow:\nI'll advertise this bird to-morrow.'\nTo this the bird seven words did say:\n'Why not do it, sir, to-day?'"}
