{"subject": "At Eleusis", "text": "I, at Eleusis, saw the finest sight,\n\nWhen early morning's banners were unfurled.\n\nFrom high Olympus, gazing on the world,\n\nThe ancient gods once saw it with delight.\n\nSad Demeter had in a single night\n\nRemoved her sombre garments! and mine eyes\n\nBeheld a 'broidered mantle in pale dyes\n\nThrown o'er her throbbing bosom. Sweet and clear\n\nThere fell the sound of music on mine ear.\n\nAnd from the South came Hermes, he whose lyre\n\nOne time appeased the great Apollo's ire.\n\nThe rescued maid, Persephone, by the hand\n\nHe led to waiting Demeter, and cheer\n\nAnd light and beauty once more blessed the land."}
