{"subject": "Between Ghent And Bruges", "text": "AH yes, exactly so; but when a man \nHas trundled out of England into France \nAnd half through Belgium, always in this prance \nOf steam, and still has stuck to his first plan\u2014 \nBlank verse or sonnets; and as he began \nWould end;\u2014why, even the blankest verse may chance \nTo falter in default of circumstance, \nAnd even the sonnet miss its mystic span. \nTrees will be trees, grass grass, pools merely pools, \nUnto the end of time and Belgium\u2014points \nOf fact which Poets (very abject fools) \nGet scent of\u2014once their epithets grown tame \nAnd scarce. Even to these foreign rails\u2014my joints \nBegin to find their jolting much the same."}
