{"subject": "To Caroline", "text": "Think'st thou I saw thy beauteous eyes,\n   Suffus'd in tears, implore to stay;\nAnd heard unmov'd thy plenteous sighs,\n   Which said far more than words can say?\n\nThough keen the grief thy tears exprest,\n   When love and hope lay both o'erthrown;\nYet still, my girl, this bleeding breast\n   Throbb'd, with deep sorrow, as thine own.\n\nBut, when our cheeks with anguish glow'd,\n   When thy sweet lips were join'd to mine;\nThe tears that from my eyelids flow'd\n   Were lost in those which fell from thine.\n\nThou could'st not feel my burning cheek,\n   Thy gushing tears had quench'd its flame,\nAnd, as thy tongue essay'd to speak,\n   In sighs alone it breath'd my name.\n\nAnd yet, my girl, we weep in vain,\n   In vain our fate in sighs deplore;\nRemembrance only can remain,\n   But that, will make us weep the more.\n\nAgain, thou best belov'd, adieu!\n   Ah! if thou canst, o'ercome regret,\nNor let thy mind past joys review,\n   Our only hope is, to forget!"}
