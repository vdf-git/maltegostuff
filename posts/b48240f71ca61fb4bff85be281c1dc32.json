{"subject": "An Hour", "text": "Leaves glowing in the sun, zealous hum of bumblebees,\nFrom afar, from somewhere beyond the river, echoes of lingering voices\nAnd the unhurried sounds of a hammer gave joy not only to me.\nBefore the five senses were opened, and earlier than any beginning\nThey waited, ready, for all those who would call themselves mortals,\nSo that they might praise, as I do, life, that is, happiness."}
