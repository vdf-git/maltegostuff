{"subject": "Dream-Love", "text": "I ALWAYS seem to love you in my dreams \nOf force, and right, and nature, full and free; \nSleep after sleep, the very self of me \nLost in the nearest of your spirit seems. \nYet, as the grey of real daylight streams \nAcross the bright deep of my passion's sea, \nThere crawls a chill, a cloud up lingeringly \nTo sap the glow from night's divinest gleams. \n\nWhich take for truth? Why are you ever twain? \nAwake, my intellect's serenest friend; \nAsleep, my being's sovereign, meaning, end,-- \nMy heart's desire, delight, possession, pain? \nAh! might I, dreaming, drive my love away; \nOr better, wake to find I love by day."}
