{"subject": "Ancestors", "text": "Behold these jewelled, merchant Ancestors, \nForegathered in some chancellery of death; \nCalm, provident, discreet, they stroke their beards \nAnd move their faces slowly in the gloom, \nAnd barter monstrous wealth with speech subdued,\nLustreless eyes and acquiescent lids. \nAnd oft in pauses of their conference, \nThey listen to the measured breath of night\u2019s \nHushed sweep of wind aloft the swaying trees \nIn dimly gesturing gardens; then a voice\nClimbs with clear mortal song half-sad for heaven. \n\nA silent-footed message flits and brings \nThe ghostly Sultan from his glimmering halls; \nA shadow at the window, turbaned, vast, \nHe leans; and, pondering the sweet influence\nThat steals around him in remembered flowers, \nHears the frail music wind along the slopes, \nPut forth, and fade across the whispering sea."}
