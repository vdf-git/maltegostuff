{"subject": "Seasonal Visitors", "text": "First old man winter comes to us wearing a great coat of white\n He brings with him ice and cold and blizzards in the night\n\n We are all taken back by his cold storms of snow\n And so very soon we are praying for him to go\n\n Next spring dances in with her green coat laced with flowers\n And we welcome her by embracing all the scents that she showers\n\n As she begins to get warmer we realize she can not stay\n But she reminds us she has been here all of April and May\n\n It is a hot muggy day when Miss Summer finally arrives\n And we are sure we want her to stay the rest of our lives\n\n We enjoy the sun and fun but we complain about her humid air\n And when she is ready to leave in August we think it is unfair\n\n Now as God's paint brush colors the way in for Mr. Fall\n We enjoy the crisp air as we look at the colors in awe\n\n The leaves float away as Mr. Fall tells us he must go\n But he is sure that our next visitor will take over the show\n\n So you see God has given us the very best reasons\n To welcome our visitors season by season"}
