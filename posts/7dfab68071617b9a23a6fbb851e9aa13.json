{"subject": "Exile", "text": "I\n\nAt dead of night about the dying fire\nThey told a story how the dead appear;\nAnd men, grown still with fear,\nForgot their old desire\nFor those who once were dear,\nAnd shook and trembled lest their dead be near.\n\nAlas, poor dead who were so sweet and human!\nHow are you grown a menace and a blight \u00ad\nA thing to shun, a thing of evil omen,\u00ad\nStealing unwelcome through the halls of night?,\nWho knows? perhaps yourselves are much affrighted,\nAnd struggle back, remote and bodiless,\nFearful of sounds unheard, visions unsighted,\nBlack echoes, and the bitter loneliness.\n\nBut for me, in my heart is no dread \nOf the coming again of the dead,\nBut a terror of life, without one\nWho made life to be life - and is gone.\n\nII\n\nYes, at these tales of how the dead return,\nHope stirs within my spirit more than fear.\nSo strange, so strange it seems, you are not here, \nAnd so unnatural to me 'tis to learn\nThe trick of life without you, year by year,\n\nThat not so strange could any specter be \nOr fall of footsteps on the empty stair,\nOr shapes discerned upon the shadowy air, \nAs is this haunting sense of vacancy,\nAnd your persisting absence everywhere.\n\nAh, could I see, as in the tranquil past,\nThe form I long for - always and in vain, -\nShould I not cry, like one released from pain:\n'Dear and long absent, you return at last,\nAnd life its natural aspect wears again!'"}
