{"subject": "Dedicatory Hymn", "text": "Composed For The Opening of Chapel Lane Chapel\nBeyond the immeasurable space\nWhere glimmers the remotest star;\nBeyond those cycles whence we trace,\nThough faintly, what we were and are;\nThe only lights that smile and shine,\nAnd elevate, are Thee and thine.\nFrom Thee to thine we grope our way,\nBut feel more vigour as we grope;\nWhile darkness brightens into day,\nAnd faith is born of trembling hope:\nAnd on still-strengthening pinions we\nSoar up from what is thine-to Thee!\nBe with us now! The pile we rear\nIn reverence-may the worshipper\nWho seeks Thy presence find it here;\nThyself the Great Interpreter\nTo unveil the veiled-to pour Thy light\nIn all its glories-infinite."}
