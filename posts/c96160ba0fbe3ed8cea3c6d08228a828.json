{"subject": "The Shattered Dream", "text": "I WAS somewhere off in Europe spending money like a king, \nOwned a yacht like J. P. Morgan's, when the 'phone began to ring; \nI was entertaining princes, dukes and earls, when wifie said: \n'It's the telephone that's ringing, you must hustle out of bed.' \nAnd I wandered down the stairway, grumbling o'er my vanished joy,\nGrowled: 'Hello;' and then he shouted: 'You're an uncle! It's a boy!'\n\nI was dazed for half a minute\u2014when you're cruising foreign seas \nWith a lot of royal people, and your sails are full of breeze, \nAnd your guests are gaily laughing, and your skies are blue above,\nThe arrival of a baby isn't what you're thinking of; \nAnd I hardly knew I'd taken that old 'phone receiver down \nWhen excitedly he shouted: 'There's a junior come to town!'\n\nBut I traveled back from Europe just as quickly as I could, \nAnd left those dukes and princes and I shouted to him: 'Good!'\nI fired my stylish butlers and I threw my yacht away, \nIn my dollar-blue-pajamas I stood there and cried: 'Hooray!' \nI quit the king, not caring that my conduct might annoy, \nAnd I shouted up to mother: 'Did you hear me? It's a boy!'\n\nWhen I'm dreaming I am wealthy and with money I am free, \nThere are times I do not welcome folks who telephone to me;\nBut I don't begrudge the finest dream that ever sweetened sleep \nTo one who has such news as that, great news that cannot keep. \nHe may wake me any moment, and my peace it won't destroy,\nFor I'll share his gladness with him, when he tells me: 'It's a boy!'"}
