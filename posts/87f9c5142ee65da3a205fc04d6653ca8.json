{"subject": "Ego", "text": "Day passeth day in sunshine or shadow, \nNight unto night each cycle is told; \nSun, moon and stars in whirling and glamour, \nAll unto all the creation unfold.\n\nWhat of the strivings, what of the gropings, \nOut from the darkness into the light? \nWhat of the weepings, what of the grievings \nNow from the day to the passionate night?\n\nStars of the stars, heavens of the heavens, \nRising or falling or pausing a span, \nEach to the great \"I am\" replying \nE'en as the crystal, e'en as man.\n\nChant of the worlds from aeon to aeon, \nSong of the soul from dust unto dust, \nDream of the clods that, upward and starward, \nRise to the call of the primal \"Thou must.\"\n\nSpace beyond space, eternity's vision, \nChaos to chaos, calm unto calm, \nWorld beneath world, heaven above heaven, \nLife but the urge, death but the balm."}
