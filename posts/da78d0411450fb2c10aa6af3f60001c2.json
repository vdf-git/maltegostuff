What is this \u2018sleep\u2019, which seems  \nTo bound all? can there be a \u2018waking\u2019 point  \nOf crowning life? The soul would never rule\u2014  \nIt would be first in all things\u2014it would have          \nIts utmost pleasure filled,\u2014but that complete  \nCommanding for commanding sickens it.  \nThe last point I can trace is, rest beneath  \nSome better essence than itself\u2014in weakness;  \nThis is \u2018myself\u2019\u2014not what I think should be         \nAnd what is that I hunger for but God?  \nMy God, my God! let me for once look on thee  \nAs tho\u2019 nought else existed: we alone.  \nAnd as creation crumbles, my soul\u2019s spark  \nExpands till I can say, \u2018Even from myself         \nI need thee, and I feel thee, and I love thee;  \nI do not plead my rapture in thy works  \nFor love of thee\u2014or that I feel as one  \nWho cannot die\u2014but there is that in me  \nWhich turns to thee, which loves, or which should love.\u2019         \n\nWhy have I girt myself with this hell-dress?  \nWhy have I laboured to put out my life?  \nIs it not in my nature to adore,  \nAnd e\u2019en for all my reason do I not  \nFeel him, and thank him, and pray to him\u2014now?         \nCan I forgo the trust that he loves me?  \nDo I not feel a love which only ONE\u2026  \nO thou pale form, so dimly seen, deep-eyed,  \nI have denied thee calmly\u2014do I not  \nPant when I read of thy consummate deeds,         \nAnd burn to see thy calm pure truths out-flash  \nThe brightest gleams of earth\u2019s philosophy?  \nDo I not shake to hear aught question thee?  \nIf I am erring save me, madden me,  \nTake from me powers and pleasures\u2014let me die.         \nAges, so I see thee: I am knit round  \nAs with a charm, by sin and lust and pride,  \nYet tho\u2019 my wandering dreams have seen all shapes  \nOf strange delight, oft have I stood by thee\u2014  \nHave I been keeping lonely watch with thee         \nIn the damp night by weeping Olivet,  \nOr leaning on thy bosom, proudly less\u2014  \nOr dying with thee on the lonely cross\u2014  \nOr witnessing thy bursting from the tomb!"}
