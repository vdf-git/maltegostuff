{"subject": "To the Fire-Fly of Jamaica, Seen in a Collection", "text": "How art thou alter'd! since afar,\nThou seem'dst a bright earth wandering star;\nWhen thy living lustre ran,\nTall majestic trees between,\nAnd Guazume, or Swietan,\nOr the Pimento's glossy green,\nAs caught their varnish'd leaves, thy glancing light\nReflected flying fires, amid the moonless night.\n\nFrom shady heights, where currents spring,\nWhere the ground dove dips her wing,\nWinds of night reviving blow,\nThro' rustling fields of maize and cane,\nAnd wave the Coffee's fragrant bough;\nBut winds of night, for thee in vain\nMay breathe, of the Plumeria's luscious bloom,\nOr Granate's scarlet buds, or Plinia's mild perfume.\n\nThe recent captive, who in vain,\nAttempts to break his heavy chain,\nAnd find his liberty in flight;\nShall no more in terror hide,\nFrom thy strange and doubtful light,\nIn the mountain's cavern'd side,\nOr gully deep, where gibbering monkies cling,\nAnd broods the giant bat, on dark funereal wing.\n\nNor thee his darkling steps to aid,\nThro' the forest's pathless shade,\nShall the sighing Slave invoke;\nWho, his daily task perform'd,\nWould forget his heavy yoke;\nAnd by fond affections warm'd,\nGlide to some dear sequester'd spot, to prove,\nFriendship's consoling voice, or sympathising love.\n\nNow, when sinks the Sun away,\nAnd fades at once the sultry day,\nThee, as falls the sudden night,\nNever Naturalist shall view,\nDart with corruscation bright,\nDown the cocoa avenue;\nOr see thee give, with transient gleams to glow,\nThe green Banana's head, or Shaddock's loaded bough.\n\nAh! never more shalt thou behold,\nThe midnight Beauty, slow unfold\nHer golden zone, and thro' the gloom\nTo thee her radiant leaves display,\nMore lovely than the roseate bloom\nOf flowers, that drink the tropic day;\nAnd while thy dancing flames around her blaze,\nShed odours more refin'd, and beam with brighter rays.\n\nThe glass thy faded form contains,\nBut of thy lamp no spark remains;\nThat lamp, which through the palmy grove,\nFloated once with sapphire beam,\nAs lucid as the star of Love,\nReflected in the bickering stream;\nTransient and bright! so human meteors rise,\nAnd glare and sink, in pensive Reason 's eyes.\n\nYe dazzling comets that appear\nIn Fashion's rainbow atmosphere,\nLightning and flashing for a day;\nThink ye, how fugitive your fame?\nHow soon from her light scroll away,\nIs wafted your ephemeron name?\nEven tho' on canvas still your forms are shewn,\nOr the slow chisel shapes the pale resembling stone.\n\nLet vaunting O STENTATION trust\nThe pencil's art, or marble bust,\nWhile long neglected modest worth\nUnmark'd, unhonor'd, and unknown,\nObtains at length a little earth,\nWhere kindred merit weeps alone;\nYet there, tho' V ANITY no trophies rear,\nIs Friendship 's long regret, and true A FFECTION 's tear!"}
