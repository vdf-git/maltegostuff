{"subject": "Sonnet Ii, Written At Cliefden Spring", "text": "Here from the rifted rock, where boldly rise\nThe ilex shining with perennial green,\nThe gloomy pine, the beech's vivid skreen,\nHoar oaks that throw their branches to the skies;\nWhile 'mid the boles the zephyr gently sighs,\nAnd woodbines sweet, and lychen, creep between,\nAmid the stillness of the sylvan scene,\nTranquil the silver-bosom'd Naiad lies;\nWhile from her urn the rills redundant glide,\nWhere his broad flood majestic Thames displays.\nNor thou with haughty look, Imperial Tide,\nUpon the clear though scanty tribute gaze;\nNe'er will the powers of Heaven itself deride\nThe humblest gift the unsullied bosom pays."}
