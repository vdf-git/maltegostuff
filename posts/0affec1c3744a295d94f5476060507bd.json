{"subject": "Ye Cannot Serve God And Mammon", "text": "Not a broken, brief obedience\nDoth the Lord of heaven demand;\nHe requires your whole allegiance,\nWords and deeds, and heart and hand:\nGod will hold divided sway\nWith no deity of clay.\nWealth and pomp and power are idols\nWorshipped by their devotees:\nBut religion's influence bridles\nAll esteem for things like these:\nThey are trappings meant to hide\nThe deformities of pride.\nHe who onward moves, pursuing\nPatiently his heavenward road,\n'Midst the rocks, and 'midst the ruin\nWhich perplex the path to God-\nNot by hope or fear betrayed,\nNor allured by vain parade:\nHe who, 'midst the world's delusions,\nKeeps his heart serene and free,\nSheltered safe from the intrusions\nOf unhallowed vanity;-\nHe, heaven's crown of bliss shall wear,\nHe, earth's brightest portion share."}
