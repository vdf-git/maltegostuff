{"subject": "I Shall Succeed", "text": "I shall succeed, although Fate rules to-day, \nAnd heaps up thorns and thistles in my way. \nI bear the yoke and tread them with a smile, \nFor I am sure it is but for awhile. \n\nEach day that dawns I strive to break the chain, \nAlthough to-day it seems so massive strong; \nAlthough it seems my labors are in vain, \nI'll strive and wait, it matters not how long. \n\nFor like the drip that falls upon the millstone, \nSo soft it strikes at first it seems but play; \nBut drip on drip a tiny dent will come\u2014 \nWe turn at length and find it washed away. \n\nThus will I beat Fate's chains, though strokes be feeble, \nTo hasty men it all may seem but play. \nThe hand of man though soft as drops is able, \nTo wear at length the hardest stone away."}
