{"subject": "The Princess: A Medley: O Swallow", "text": "O Swallow, Swallow, flying, flying South,\n    Fly to her, and fall upon her gilded eaves,\n    And tell her, tell her, what I tell to thee.\n    O tell her, Swallow, thou that knowest each,\n    That bright and fierce and fickle is the South,\n    And dark and true and tender is the North.\n    O Swallow, Swallow, if I could follow, and light\n    Upon her lattice, I would pipe and trill,\n    And cheep and twitter twenty million loves.\n\n   O were I thou that she might take me in,\n   And lay me on her bosom, and her heart\n   Would rock the snowy cradle till I died.\n\n   Why lingereth she to clothe her heart with love,\n   Delaying as the tender ash delays\n   To clothe herself, when all the woods are green?\n\n   O tell her, Swallow, that thy brood is flown:\n   Say to her, I do but wanton in the South,\n   But in the North long since my nest is made.\n\n   O tell her, brief is life but love is long,\n   And brief the sun of summer in the North,\n   And brief the moon of beauty in the South.\n\n   O Swallow, flying from the golden woods,\n   Fly to her, and pipe and woo her, and make her mine,\n   And tell her, tell her, that I follow thee."}
