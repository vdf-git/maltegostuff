{"subject": "The Crucifixion, Still", "text": "Still, still upon the cross! \nYet is it writ that Thou, \nWith thorn-pierc'd brow, \nAmid the jeer of mocking lips, the toss \nOf mocking heads, a thief on either side, \nWert crucified; \nNailed to the awful tree- \nThy Throne of agony- \nThou, Son of God! Thy blood, thy life didst give \nThat we might live. \n\nNay, Lord, can this be so \nAnd earth not know? \nThy star, whose fields Thy feet divine once trod \nFresh from the fields of God; \nThy natal star, whose skies \nHave quickened to Thine eyes, \nWhile thrilled through boundless space \nThe worlds to greet Thy face \nFrom this, dear Lord- one of the least thereof, \nGreat only in Thy love. \nIn Thy love, only, great! \nO Christ compassionate, \nPity us, deaf and blind, \nFrail humankind! \nPity us, loving still- \nThough all in vain \nSeemeth Thy price is pain; \nPity us, loving still- \nThough still with sin, and shame, and strife, and hate, \nWe thwart Thy will. \n\nStill, still upon the cross! \nFor lo! our every evil is a thorn \nWherewith our hands adorn \nThy bleeding brow; each brother-help denied \nA spear-thrust in Thy side, \nDaily betray we Thee for gold dross: \nThrough the long centuries \nUnheeding, and still heeding not Thy cries, \nSo hold we Thee, O Savior, crucified- \nStill, still on the cross."}
