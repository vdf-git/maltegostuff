{"subject": "Inspiration", "text": "How often have I started out\nWith no thought in my noodle,\nAnd wandered here and there about,\nWhere fancy bade me toddle;\nTill feeling faunlike in my glee\nI've voiced some gay distiches,\nReturning joyfully to tea,\nA poem in my britches.\n\nA-squatting on a thymy slope\nWith vast of sky about me,\nI've scribbled on an envelope\nThe rhymes the hills would shout me;\nThe couplets that the trees would call,\nThe lays the breezes proffered . . .\nOh no, I didn't think at all -\nI took what Nature offered.\n\nFor that's the way you ought to write -\nWithout a trace of trouble;\nBe super-charged with high delight\nAnd let the words out-bubble;\nBe voice of vale and wood and stream\nWithout design or proem:\nThen rouse from out a golden dream\nTo find you've made a poem.\n\nSo I'll go forth with mind a blank,\nAnd sea and sky will spell me;\nAnd lolling on a thymy bank\nI'll take down what they tell me;\nAs Mother Nature speaks to me\nHer words I'll gaily docket,\nSo I'll come singing home to tea\nA poem in my pocket."}
