{"subject": "The Burning-Glass", "text": "I watch the hours of long ago: \nTheir blue and secret depths I set \nUnder the burning-glass, Regret, \nAnd watch a happier flora blow. \n\nHold up the glass o'er my desires!\nBehold them through my soul, a glass! \nAt memory's touch the withered grass \nBreaks forth into devouring fires.\n\nNow above my thoughts I hold\nThe azure crystal, in whose heart \nSuddenly unfolding start\nThe leaves of agonies borne of old, \n\nUntil those nights remote I see \nEven to memory dead so long \nThat their sullen tears do wrong \nTo the green soul of hopes to be."}
