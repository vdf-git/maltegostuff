{"subject": "Lines Written Beneath An Elm In The Churchyard Of Harrow On The Hill, Sept. 2, 1807", "text": "Spot of my youth! whose hoary branches sigh,\nSwept by the breeze that fans thy cloudless sky;\nWhere now alone I muse, who oft have trod,\nWith those I loved, thy soft and verdant sod;\nWith those who, scattered far, perchance deplore,\nLike me, the happy scenes they knew before:\nOh! as I trace again thy winding hill,\nMine eyes admire, my heart adores thee still,\nThou drooping Elm! beneath whose boughs I lay,\nAnd frequent mused the twilight hours away;\nWhere, as they once were wont, my limbs recline,\nBut ah! without the thoughts which then were mine.\nHow do thy branches, moaning to the blast,\nInvite the bosom to recall the past,\nAnd seem to whisper, as the gently swell,\n'Take, while thou canst, a lingering, last farewell!'\n\nWhen fate shall chill, at length, this fevered breast,\nAnd calm its cares and passions into rest,\nOft have I thought, 'twould soothe my dying hour,\u2014 \nIf aught may soothe when life resigns her power,\u2014 \nTo know some humbler grave, some narrow cell,\nWould hide my bosom where it loved to dwell.\nWith this fond dream, methinks, 'twere sweet to die\u2014 \nAnd here it lingered, here my heart might lie;\nHere might I sleep, where all my hopes arose,\nScene of my youth, and couch of my repose;\nFor ever stretched beneath this mantling shade,\nPressed by the turf where once my childhood played;\nWrapped by the soil that veils the spot I loved,\nMixed with the earth o'er which my footsteps moved;\nBlest by the tongues that charmed my youthful ear,\nMourned by the few my soul acknowledged here;\nDeplored by those in early days allied,\nAnd unremembered by the world beside."}
