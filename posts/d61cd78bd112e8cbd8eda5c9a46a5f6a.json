{"subject": "The Mourner", "text": "I have no heart for noon-tide and the sun, \nBut I will take me where more tender night \nShakes, fold on fold, her dewy darkness down. \nAnd shelters me that I may weep in peace, \nAnd feel no pitying eyes, and hear no voice \nAttempt my grief in comfort's alien tongue. \n\nWhere cypresses, more black than night is black, \nBorder straight paths, or where, on hillside slopes, \nThe dim grglimmer of the olive trees \nLies like a breath, a ghost, upon the dark, \nThere will I wander when the nightingale \nCeases, and even the veil'ed stars withdraw \nTheir tremulous light, there find myself at rest, \n\nA silence and a shadow in the gloom. \nBut all the dead of all the world shall know \nThe pacing of my sable-sandall'd feet, \nAnd know my tear-drenched veil along the grass, \nAnd think them less forsaken in their graves, \n\nSaying: There's one remembers, one still mourns; \nFor the forgotten dead are dead indeed."}
