{"subject": "The Hill", "text": "Do not slap me, destiny,  \nMetres of smacks already cover my face. \nHere I am, while the wind's blowing in the streets, \nCharging out of books, dictionaries and taverns \nThe same way soldiers charge out of trenches. \nO centuries, mean like an insect,  \nYou who seduced me with a fan instead of a storm,  \nWith matches instead of volcanos.  \nI will never forgive you.  \nI will return to my village, on foot if need be \nI will spread, on my arrival, rumours about you.  \nI will lie down on the grass and beside the ditches \nLike a knight exhausted after battle.\n\nLike trained dogs leaping circles of fire \nI will cross these gates and windows,  \nThese sleeves and collars, \nFlying like a hawk \nAbove the shyness of virgins  \nAnd the suffering of workers \nAt twilight spreading my wings like a swallow \nIn search of a virgin land that at the lightest touch  \nOf a cottage, a palace, an emir or a begger,  \nWill leap in the air as a wild horse  \nAt the touch of a saddle,  \nA land that has not existed and will never exist  \nExcept in my notebooks.\n\nAll right, century, you have defeated me,  \nBut I will not find in all the Orient \nA summit where I can hoist  \nThe flag of my surrender."}
