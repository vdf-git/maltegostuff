{"subject": "O My Pa-Pa", "text": "Our fathers have formed a poetry workshop.\nThey sit in a circle of disappointment over our fastballs\nand wives. We thought they didn't read our stuff,\nwhole anthologies of poems that begin, My father never,\nor those that end, and he was silent as a carp,\nor those with middles which, if you think\nof the right side as a sketch, look like a paunch\nof beer and worry, but secretly, with flashlights\nin the woods, they've read every word and noticed\nthat our nine happy poems have balloons and sex\nand giraffes inside, but not one dad waving hello\nfrom the top of a hill at dusk. Theirs\nis the revenge school of poetry, with titles like\n'My Yellow Sheet Lad' and 'Given Your Mother's Taste\nfor Vodka, I'm Pretty Sure You're Not Mine.'\nThey're not trying to make the poems better\nso much as sharper or louder, more like a fishhook\nor electrocution, as a group\nthey overcome their individual senilities,\ntheir complete distaste for language, how cloying\nit is, how like tears it can be, and remember\nevery mention of their long hours at the office\nor how tired they were when they came home,\nwhen they were dragged through the door\nby their shadows. I don't know why it's so hard\nto write a simple and kind poem to my father, who worked,\nnot like a dog, dogs sleep most of the day in a ball\nof wanting to chase something, but like a man, a man\nwith seven kids and a house to feed, whose absence\nwas his presence, his present, the Cheerios,\nthe PF Flyers, who taught me things about trees,\nthat they're the most intricate version of standing up,\nwho built a grandfather clock with me so I would know\nthat time is a constructed thing, a passing, ticking fancy.\nA bomb. A bomb that'll go off soon for him, for me,\nand I notice in our fathers' poems a reciprocal dwelling\non absence, that they wonder why we disappeared\nas soon as we got our licenses, why we wanted\nthe rocket cars, as if running away from them\nto kiss girls who looked like mirrors of our mothers\nwasn't fast enough, and it turns out they did\nstart to say something, to form the words hey\nor stay, but we'd turned into a door full of sun,\ninto the burning leave, and were gone\nbefore it came to them that it was all right\nto shout, that they should have knocked us down\nwith a hand on our shoulders, that they too are mystified\nby the distance men need in their love."}
