{"subject": "Wayside flowers on the Hazel Brae", "text": "Daybreak of your voice across the ocean\nSwept through me like a fresh wind over water\nAnd left my longing palpable and keen.\nNow I'm walking the Brae in windy weather,\nDark, then bright, then dark as the cloud-shapes alter.\nThe vagabond wildrose blooms in the ditches,\nSwaying in wind as it would float on water.\nOver the next rise, a meadow of daisies\nIs spotted with clover as dark as wine\nOr what stipples you when you come from the shower\nAnd lie down near me not entirely dry.\nA drift of light rain falls across the air\nAs I walk the Brae away from you, caught\nUp in flowers and the flower of my thought."}
