{"subject": "I Am Not I", "text": "I'm the Andalusian living between the pleasures of lovers' renion\nAnd the rattles of separation.\nI'm the Zahirite from Corddoba\nWho has renounced all power and ministerial positions.\nI'm the one who was brought up in women's laps\nAnd grew up in their presence,\nThey're the ones who taught me poetry, calligraphy, and the Qur'an.\nOf their secrets, I've learnt what hardly anyone else has learnt.\n\nI'm the one who says: Death is easier than lovers' separation.\nThis is my law-\nTo reveal secrets to ardent lovers\nIn Baghdad and Fes,\nIn Cordoba and Qayrawan,\nTo accompany a tear to its burning anxieties,\nTo bless a rose on its way between a sweetheart and a lover,\nAnd write to you\nAbout this seed which is sufficient\nFor everyone who is\nIn the presence of madness\nOn the paths of  hearing and seeing.\n\nTranslated by Issa J. Boullata"}
