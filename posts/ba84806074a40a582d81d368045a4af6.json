{"subject": "To Youth", "text": "O YOUTH, sweet comrade Youth, wouldst thou be gone? \nLong have we dwelt together, thou and I; \nTogether drunk of many an alien dawn, \nAnd plucked the fruit of many an alien sky. \nAh, fickle friend, must I, who yesterday \nDreamed forwards to long, undimmed ecstasy, \nHenceforward dream, because thou wilt not stay, \nBackward to transient pleasure and to thee? \nI give thee back thy false, ephemeral vow; \nBut, O beloved comrade, ere we part, \nUpon my mournful eyelids and my brow \nKiss me who hold thine image in my heart."}
