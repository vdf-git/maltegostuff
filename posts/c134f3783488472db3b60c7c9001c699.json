{"subject": "Letter To GC", "text": "I say most sincerely and desperately, HAPPY NEW YEAR! \n\nHaving rowed a little farther away from the cliff\n\nWhich is my kind of religion\n\nAdrift in the darkness but readying oars\n\nHow can there be too many stars and hands, I ask you\n\n                               \u2014\n\nI would be disingenuous if I said \"being understood\" were not important to me \n\nBetween the ceiling of private dream and the floor of public speech \n\nBetween the coin and the hand it crosses\n\nMercantilists' and governors' and preachers' alike\n\nThe imagination and its products so often rebuff purpose\n\nAnd some of us don't like it, and want to make it mean\n\nI would never shoot you, even if you were the only meat around\n\n                               \u2014\n\nAnyway, I empathize with your lower division semester (which sounds\n         kinda Dante, to me)\n\nSnow-bound sounds gorgeous and inconvenient\n\nLike the idea of ending on the internal rhyme of psychics and clients\n\nThough I too privilege the \"shiny\" \n\nAnd of course, I want to be approved of, so much \n\nDespite the image I've been savoring, the one of the self-stitching wound\n\nYes, I want to write that self-healing wound poem, the one with\n         cocoon closed up with thorns\n\nWe are getting such lovely flourishes from our poets\n\nFathomless opportunities for turning literacy into event\n\nIt's the drama of feeling we find such an aesthetic problem, \n         these days"}
