{"subject": "The Quadroon Girl", "text": "The Slaver in the broad lagoon\nLay moored with idle sail;\nHe waited for the rising moon,\nAnd for the evening gale. \n\nUnder the shore his boat was tied,\nAnd all her listless crew\nWatched the gray alligator slide\nInto the still bayou. \n\nOdors of orange-flowers, and spice,\nReached them from time to time,\nLike airs that breathe from Paradise\nUpon a world of crime. \n\nThe Planter, under his roof of thatch,\nSmoked thoughtfully and slow;\nThe Slaver's thumb was on the latch,\nHe seemed in haste to go. \n\nHe said, 'My ship at anchor rides\nIn yonder broad lagoon;\nI only wait the evening tides,\nAnd the rising of the moon.'\n\nBefore them, with her face upraised,\nIn timid attitude,\nLike one half curious, half amazed,\nA Quadroon maiden stood. \n\nHer eyes were large, and full of light,\nHer arms and neck were bare;\nNo garment she wore save a kirtle bright,\nAnd her own long, raven hair. \n\nAnd on her lips there played a smile\nAs holy, meek, and faint,\nAs lights in some cathedral aisle\nThe features of a saint. \n\n'The soil is barren,--the farm is old,'\nThe thoughtful planter said;\nThen looked upon the Slaver's gold,\nAnd then upon the maid. \n\nHis heart within him was at strife\nWith such accurs\u00e9d gains:\nFor he knew whose passions gave her life,\nWhose blood ran in her veins. \n\nBut the voice of nature was too weak;\nHe took the glittering gold!\nThen pale as death grew the maiden's cheek,\nHer hands as icy cold. \n\nThe Slaver led her from the door,\nHe led her by the hand,\nTo be his slave and paramour\nIn a strange and distant land!"}
