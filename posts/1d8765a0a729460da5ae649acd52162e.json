{"subject": "Holy Grail", "text": "Cumulus breaks across a ketchup sky.\nI'm my own disjecta membra. Leaving\nWas a mode of leave-taking from toppling\nColumns of counterfeit selves. The genuine I\nIs forever in someone's tourist brochure.\nWholeness is mobility, thought Orpheus\nIn his dismemberment. The rancorous\nCries of exiles will make Lethe remember\nThe anguish of those who never forget.\nWe must all drown in another's epithet."}
