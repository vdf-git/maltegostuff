{"subject": "Tell Me", "text": "'Traveller, what lies over the hill?\nTraveller, tell to me:\nTip-toe-high on the window-sill\nOver I cannot see.'\n\n'My child, a valley green lies there,\nLovely with trees, and shy;\nAnd a tiny brook that says, 'Take care,\nOr I'll drown you by and by!''\n\n'And what comes next?'-'A little town,\nAnd a towering hill again;\nMore hills and valleys up and down,\nAnd a river now and then.'\n\n'And what comes next?'-'A lonely moor\nWithout one beaten way,\nAnd slow clouds drifting dull before\nA wind that will not stay.'\n\n'And then?'-'Dark rocks and yellow sand,\nBlue sea and a moaning tide.'\n'And then?'-'More sea, and then more land,\nWith rivers deep and wide.'\n\n'And then?'-'Oh, rock and mountain and vale,\nOcean and shores and men,\nOver and over, a weary tale,\nAnd round to your home again!'\n\n'And is that all? From day to day,\nLike one with a long chain bound,\nShould I walk and walk and not get away,\nBut go always round and round?'\n\n'No, no; I have not told you the best,\nI have not told you the end:\nIf you want to escape, away in the west\nYou will see a stair ascend,\n\n'Built of all colours of lovely stones,\nA stair up into the sky\nWhere no one is weary, and no one moans,\nOr wishes to be laid by.'\n\n'Is it far away?'-'I do not know:\nYou must fix your eyes thereon,\nAnd travel, travel through thunder and snow,\nTill the weary way is gone.\n\n'All day, though you never see it shine,\nYou must travel nor turn aside,\nAll night you must keep as straight a line\nThrough moonbeams or darkness wide.'\n\n'When I am older!'-'Nay, not so!'\n'I have hardly opened my eyes!'\n'He who to the old sunset would go,\nStarts best with the young sunrise.'\n\n'Is the stair right up? is it very steep?'\n'Too steep for you to climb;\nYou must lie at the foot of the glorious heap\nAnd patient wait your time.'\n\n'How long?'-'Nay, that I cannot tell.'\n'In wind, and rain, and frost?'\n'It may be so; and it is well\nThat you should count the cost.\n\n'Pilgrims from near and from distant lands\nWill step on you lying there;\nBut a wayfaring man with wounded hands\nWill carry you up the stair.'"}
