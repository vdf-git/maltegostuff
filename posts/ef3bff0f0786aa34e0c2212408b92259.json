{"subject": "Suicide", "text": "Plastic bags have no wings to fly\nbut they insist to try\n\nFlying is the dream of all creatures\n\nIt is despair rather than hope which pushes these bags high into the sky\nThey stuff their lungs with air like mail frogs\nand leap into space\n\nMost of them will fall down to be captured by thorny plants\n\n'leave me alone', the bag cries.\n'I want to die. I want to throw myself from the highest building in Ramallah'.\n\nBut people do not stop throwing bags\nThey throw them like dice, watching them by the edge of their eyes\nFearing that those who succeeded to fly will soon fall over their heads\nlike suicidal crows ."}
