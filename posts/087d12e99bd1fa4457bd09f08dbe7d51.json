{"subject": "Epilogue", "text": "The day is done; and, lo! the shades\nMelt 'neath Diana's mellow grace.\nHark, how those deep, designing maids\nFeign terror in this sylvan place!\nCome, friends, it's time that we should go;\nWe're honest married folk, you know.\n\nWas not the wine delicious cool\nWhose sweetness Pyrrha's smile enhanced?\nAnd by that clear Bandusian pool\nHow gayly Chloe sung and danced!\nAnd Lydia Die,--aha, methinks\nYou'll not forget the saucy minx!\n\nBut, oh, the echoes of those songs\nThat soothed our cares and lulled our hearts!\nNot to that age nor this belongs\nThe glory of what heaven-born arts\nSpeak with the old distinctive charm\nFrom yonder humble Sabine farm!\n\nThe day is done. Now off to bed,\nLest by some rural ruse surprised,\nAnd by those artful girls misled,\nYou two be sadly compromised.\n_You_ go; perhaps _I_'d better stay\nTo shoo the giddy things away!\n\nBut sometime we shall meet again\nBeside Digentia, cool and clear,--\nYou and we twain, old friend; and then\nWe'll have our fill of pagan cheer.\nThen, could old Horace join us three,\nHow proud and happy he would be!\n\nOr if we part to meet no more\nThis side the misty Stygian Sea,\nBe sure of this: on yonder shore\nSweet cheer awaiteth such as we;\nA Sabine pagan's heaven, O friend,--\nThe fellowship that knows no end!"}
