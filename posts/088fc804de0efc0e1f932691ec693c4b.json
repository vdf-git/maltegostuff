{"subject": "Sweet Times", "text": "Speak to me of Sweet Times my Love\n Of Gaiety and Laughter and Love Ever After\n Of Sunshine Bright, Blue Skies and Starlit Nights\n Croon to me Tunes so Tender and Light\n Dance with me on the Rim of Imagination All Night\n Spin with me Lofty Dreams of Tomorrow\n Where we'll Never Meet with Sorrow\n Take My Hand and Soar With Me There\n And I'll Rest in Your Loving Arms with Never a Care."}
