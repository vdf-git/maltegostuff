{"subject": "Song 9", "text": "THE season comes when first we met,\nBut you return no more;\nWhy cannot I the days forget,\nWhich time can ne'er restore?\nO days too sweet, too bright to last,\nAre you indeed for ever past?\nThe fleeting shadows of delight,\nIn memory I trace;\nIn fancy stop their rapid flight,\nAnd all the past replace:\nBut, ah, I wake to endless woes,\nAnd tears the fading visions close!"}
