{"subject": "As I Move On With You", "text": "Different days,\nDifferent hours,\nMany faces,\nbouqutes of flowers,\n\nFantisies,\nAnd mists,\nOf dreams,\n\nLost away,\nOnto the ways,\nOf yesterday,\n\nSee the future,\nPast untold,\nIn his arms,\nIs her hold,\n\nWatch the moments,\nSee me through,\nAs my love,\nMoves on with you.."}
