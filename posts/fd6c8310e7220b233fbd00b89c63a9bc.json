{"subject": "Jadis - Prologue", "text": "Off, be off, now, graceless pack:\nGet you gone, lost children mine:\nYour release is earned in fine:\nThe Chimaera lends her back.\n\nHuddling on her, go, God-sped,\nAs a dream-horde crowds and cowers\nMid the shadowy curtain-flowers\nRound a sick man's haunted bed.\n\nHold! My hand, unfit before,\nFeeble still, but feverless,\nAnd which palpitates no more\nSave with a desire to bless,\n\nBlesses you, O little flies\nOf my black suns and white nights.\nSpread your rustling wings, arise,\nLittle griefs, little delights,\n\nHopes, despairs, dreams foul and fair,\nAll!--renounced since yesterday\nBy my heart that quests elsewhere....\nIte, aegri somnia!"}
