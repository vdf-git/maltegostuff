{"subject": "Epitaph Of Robert Preston", "text": "Bacchus, to give the toping world surprise,\nProduced one sober son, and here he lies.\nThough rear'd among full hogsheads, he defy'd\nThe charms of wine, and every one beside.\nO reader, if to justice thou'rt inclined,\nKeep honest Preston daily in thy mind.\nHe drew good wine, took care to fill his pots,\nHad sundry virtues that excused his faults.\nYou that on Bacchus have the like dependance,\nPray copy Bob in measure and attendance."}
