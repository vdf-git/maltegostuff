{"subject": "Nirvana", "text": "Poised as a god whose lone, detach\u00e8d post,\nA eyrie, pends between the boundary-marks\nOf finite years and those unvaried darks\nThat veil Eternity, I saw the host\nOf suns and worlds, swept from the furthermost\nOf night\u2014 confusion as of dust with sparks\u2014\nWhirl toward the opposing brink; as one who harks\nSome warning trumpet. Time, a withered ghost,\nFled with them: disunited orbs that late\nWere atoms of the universal frame,\nThey passed to some eternal fragment-heap.\nAnd, lo ! the gods, from space discorporate,\nWho were its life and vital spirit, came,\nDrawn voidward by the vampire-lips of Sleep !"}
