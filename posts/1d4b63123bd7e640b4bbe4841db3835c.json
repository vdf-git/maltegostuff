{"subject": "Evening Wish...", "text": "Sleep, sleep, sweet baby, don't you need worries. \nIt is well with me--I listen to your pledge-- \nYou said you could rest if I would not weep-- \nFor you I wept, for you I stop my griefs... \nI still remember how so happy you were \nWhen you came home from work on that birthday eve \nAnd found your favorite long-stemmed red roses \nWere paved at your gate and all through the walkway \n(The same roses now I plant at your resting place-- \nWhich waver at night in the cold, silvery light). \nHow quick you, then, yielded to your instant tears-- \nHow quicker can I now just do the likewise. \nO, Sweet, while you were with me long before, \nWould I have loved you even more and more!"}
