{"subject": "Master And Man", "text": "Do ye ken hoo to fush for the salmon?\nIf ye'll listen I'll tell ye.\nDinna trust to the books and their gammon,\nThey're but trying to sell ye.\nLeave professors to read their ain cackle\nAnd fush their ain style;\nCome awa', sir, we'll oot wi' oor tackle\nAnd be busy the while.\n\n'Tis a wee bit ower bright, ye were thinkin'?\nAw, ye'll no be the loser;\n'Tis better ten baskin' and blinkin'\nThan ane that's a cruiser.\nIf ye're bent, as I tak it, on slatter,\nYe should pray for the droot,\nFor the salmon's her ain when there's watter,\nBut she's oors when it's oot.\n\nYe may just put your flee-book behind ye,\nAne hook wull be plenty;\nIf they'll no come for this, my man, mind ye,\nThey'll no come for twenty.\nAy, a rod; but the shorter the stranger\nAnd the nearer to strike;\nFor myself I prefare it nae langer\nThan a yard or the like.\n\nNoo, ye'll stand awa' back while I'm creepin'\nWi' my snoot i' the gowans;\nThere's a bonny twalve-poonder a-sleepin'\nI' the shade o' yon rowans.\nMan, man! I was fearin' I'd stirred her,\nBut I've got her the noo!\nHoot! fushin's as easy as murrder\nWhen ye ken what to do.\n\nNa, na, sir, I doot na ye're willin'\nBut I canna permit ye;\nFor I'm thinkin' that yon kind o' killin'\nWad hardly befit ye.\nAnd some work is deefficult hushin',\nThere'd be havers and chaff:\n'Twull be best, sir, for you to be fushin'\nAnd me wi' the gaff."}
