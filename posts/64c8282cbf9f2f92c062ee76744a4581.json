{"subject": "My Lady Of Whims", "text": "(A medieval Spanish legend slanderously setting forth the utter unreason of woman.)\nROMAQUIA sat and wept her\nLace mantilla full of tears.\nKing Abit laid by his scepter,\nLeft the Council of the Peers.\n'Now what sorrow makes thee cry, mate?\nQueen of Seville, sobbing so?'\n''Tis your Andalusian climate.\nOh, I want to see the snow.'\n'Speak thy wish and it is granted;\nThine to bid and mine to please.'\nAll the hills and plains he planted\nWith a myriad almond trees.\nWhen the suns of February\nMade them white with blossoming,\nRomaquia was so merry\nThat she kissed the happy king.\n'Every ill has its panacea,'\nWrote the learned King Abit,\nSmiling on his Romaquia,\nWhile he wondered at his wit.\nRomaquia sat and wept her\nDainty fan into a dud.\nKing Abit threw by his scepter\nWith an unmajestic thud.\n'What's the trouble, top of treasures?'\n'See those women by the flood\nKneading bricks, but I've no pleasures.\nI can't dabble in the mud.'\nLoud he called his master mason\nAnd in bower of eglantine\nBuilt a jade and jasper basin,\nFilled with rose-water and wine.\nThen for mud he poured in spices,\nGinger, mace and cinnamon,\nSugar, honey, syrups, ices,\nThat the Queen might have her fun.\n'Every ill has its panacea,'\nWrote the learned King Abit\nWondering if his Romaquia\nRecognized her husband's wit.\nRomaquia in her garden\nWatered all the trees with salt\nTill they faded, and the warden\nWas beheaded for the fault\nOf his lachrymose sultana.\nOleander, citron, balm,\nOrange, lemon and banana,\nThe pomegranate, myrtle, palm,\nAll were drooping for distresses\nThat the Queen poured out in tears,\nPouting at the King's caresses\nTill he longed to box her ears.\n'Let me be!' she snapped.''You squeeze me,\nClumsy thing! You never try\nIn the very least to please me,\nSo of course I have to cry.'\n'Every ill has its panacea,'\nWrote the rueful King Abit,\n'Every ill but Romaquia.\nWives' caprices wear out wit.'"}
