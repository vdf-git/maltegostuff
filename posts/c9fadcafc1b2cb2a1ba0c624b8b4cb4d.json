{"subject": "Sir Humphrey Gilbert", "text": "Southward with fleet of ice\n   Sailed the corsair Death;\n   Wild and gast blew the blast,\n   And the east-wind was his breath.\n   His lordly ships of ice\n   Glisten in the sun;\n   On each side, like pennons wide,\n   Flashing crystal streamlets run.\n   His sails of white sea-mist\n  Dripped with silver rain;\n  But where he passed there were cast\n  Leaden shadows o'er the main.\n\n  Eastward from Campobello\n  Sir Humphrey Gilbert sailed;\n  Three days or more seaward he bore,\n  Then, alas! the land-wind failed.\n\n  Alas! the land-wind failed,\n  And ice-cold grew the night;\n  And nevermore, on sea or shore,\n  Should Sir Humphrey see the light.\n\n  He sat upon the deck,\n  The Book was in his hand;\n  \"Do not fear! Heaven is as near,\"\n  He said, \"by water as by land!\"\n\n  In the first watch of the night,\n  Without a signal's sound,\n  Out of the sea, mysteriously,\n  The fleet of Death rose all around.\n\n  The moon and the evening star\n  Were hanging in the shrouds;\n  Every mast, as it passed,\n  Seemed to rake the passing clouds.\n\n  They grappled with their prize,\n  At midnight black and cold!\n  As of a rock was the shock;\n  Heavily the ground-swell rolled.\n\n  Southward through day and dark,\n  They drift in cold embrace,\n  With mist and rain, o'er the open main;\n  Yet there seems no change of place.\n\n  Southward, forever southward,\n  They drift through dark and day;\n  And like a dream, in the Gulf-Stream\n  Sinking, vanish all away."}
