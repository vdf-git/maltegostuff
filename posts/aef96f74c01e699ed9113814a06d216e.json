{"subject": "The Day Of The Lord", "text": "The Day of the Lord is at hand, at hand:\nIts storms roll up the sky:\nThe nations sleep starving on heaps of gold;\nAll dreamers toss and sigh;\nThe night is darkest before the morn;\nWhen the pain is sorest the child is born,\nAnd the Day of the Lord at hand.\n\nGather you, gather you, angels of God-\nFreedom, and Mercy, and Truth;\nCome! for the Earth is grown coward and old,\nCome down, and renew us her youth.\nWisdom, Self-Sacrifice, Daring, and Love,\nHaste to the battle-field, stoop from above,\nTo the Day of the Lord at hand.\n\nGather you, gather you, hounds of hell-\nFamine, and Plague, and War;\nIdleness, Bigotry, Cant, and Misrule,\nGather, and fall in the snare!\nHireling and Mammonite, Bigot and Knave,\nCrawl to the battle-field, sneak to your grave,\nIn the Day of the Lord at hand.\n\nWho would sit down and sigh for a lost age of gold,\nWhile the Lord of all ages is here?\nTrue hearts will leap up at the trumpet of God,\nAnd those who can suffer, can dare.\nEach old age of gold was an iron age too,\nAnd the meekest of saints may find stern work to do,\nIn the Day of the Lord at hand.\nOn the Torridge, Devonshire,\nSeptember 10, 1849."}
