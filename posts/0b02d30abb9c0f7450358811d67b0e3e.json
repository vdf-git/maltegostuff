{"subject": "The Last Sundowner", "text": "He sat upon a fallen log\nAnd heaved a long, deep sigh.\nHis gnarled hand fondling his old dog\nAs his gaze went to the sky.\n\"There goes another pane,\" said he \n\"A soarin', roarin' pest!\nThey robs a man of privacy,\nAn' motor cars of rest.\"\n\n\"Sundownin' ain't the game ut was\nSince men have took to wings;\nAn' life grows narrer, jist because\nOf plans an' cars an' things.\nFor the planes have pinched me privit skies\nAn' the cars have grabbed me earth\nAn' all the news by wireless flies;\nSo what's sundownin' worth?\n\n\"Time was when I could sit me down\nWhere man had left no sign,\nAn' earth an' sky for miles aroun'\nFor that one hour was mine.\nAnd I could sit an' think me thorts\nAn' watch the sun go west\nWithout no crazy ingine's snorts\nTo break into me rest.\n\n\"And as the afternoon grew late\nI'd seek the haunts of men,\nAn' at some lonely homestead gate\nI'd have sure welcome then;\nAn' tucker-bags were gladly filled,\nAnd rest found for my back,\nIn \u2018change for bits of news I spilled\nAnd gossip of the track.\n\n\"But now that wireless spreads its lies\nFrom this and other lands,\nThey look on me with hard, cold eyes\nAn' give with grudgin' hands.\nIt's them that has to give me news;\nAnd when I seek some wide,\nOnce silent scene, planes spoil me views,\nAn' cars honk me aside.\"\n\nHe sat upon a fallen log\nAnd heaved a long, deep sigh:\n\"We're agein', me an' my ole dog,\nAn' old things have to die.\nSundownin's dead; men's minds an' ways\nIs changin' with a jerk.\nSeems like I'll have to end me days,\nTravellin'; in search of work.\""}
