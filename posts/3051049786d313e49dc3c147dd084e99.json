{"subject": "You Can Make It Today", "text": "You can make it today\n Don't dwell on yesterday's sorrow\n You can make it today\n Dismiss troubles that fell your way\n Wipe clean the slate - do not borrow\n needless pressure from tomorrow\n You can make it today.\n STORM\n A damp west wind blows through the trees\n Sudden darkness brings on a gloom\n Harsh thunder echoes in the breeze\n Lightning flashes brighten the room\n And heavy rain crushes the bloom\n Of fresh flowers in my garden.\n Mother Nature's at her worst again."}
