{"subject": "Indrajit's Assurance", "text": "Indrajit the son of Ravan then his lofty purpose told,\n'Midst the best and boldest Rakshas none so gallant, none so bold:\n\n'Wherefore, noble king and father, pale Bibhishan's counsel hear,\nScion of the race of Rakshas speaks not thus in dastard fear,\n\nIn this race of valiant Rakshas, known for deeds of glory done,\nFeeble-hearted, faint in courage, save Bibhishan, there is none!\n\nMatched with meanest of the Rakshas what are sons of mortal men,\nWhat are homeless human brothers hiding in the hermit's den,\n\nShall we yield to weary wand'rers, driven from their distant home,\nChased from throne and father's kingdom in the desert woods to roam?\n\nLord of sky and nether region, INDRA 'neath my weapon fell,\nPale Immortals know my valour and my warlike deeds can tell,\n\nINDRA'S tusker, huge Airavat, by my prowess overthrown,\nTrumpeted its anguished accents, shaking sky and earth with groan,\n\nMighty Gods and dauntless Daityas fame of Indrajit may know,\nAnd he yields not, king and father, to a homeless human foe!'"}
