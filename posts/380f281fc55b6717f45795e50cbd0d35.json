{"subject": "St. Andrew's Day", "text": "When brothers part for manhood's race,\n  What gift may most endearing prove\nTo keep fond memory its her place,\n  And certify a brother's love?\n\n'Tis true, bright hours together told,\n  And blissful dreams in secret shared,\nSerene or solemn, gay or bold,\n  Shall last in fancy unimpaired.\n\nE'en round the death-bed of the good\n  Such dear remembrances will hover,\nAnd haunt us with no vexing mood\n  When all the cares of earth are over.\n\nBut yet our craving spirits feel,\n  We shall live on, though Fancy die,\nAnd seek a surer pledge--a seal\n  Of love to last eternally.\n\nWho art thou, that wouldst grave thy name\n  Thus deeply in a brother's heart?\nLook on this saint, and learn to frame\n  Thy love-charm with true Christian art.\n\nFirst seek thy Saviour out, and dwell\n  Beneath this shadow of His roof,\nTill thou have scanned His features well,\n  And known Him for the Christ by proof;\n\nSuch proof as they are sure to find\n  Who spend with Him their happy days,\nClean hands, and a self-ruling mind\n  Ever in tune for love and praise.\n\nThen, potent with the spell of Heaven,\n  Go, and thine erring brother gain,\nEntice him home to be forgiven,\n  Till he, too, see his Saviour plain.\n\nOr, if before thee in the race,\n  Urge him with thine advancing tread,\nTill, like twin stars, with even pace,\n  Each lucid course be duly aped.\n\nNo fading frail memorial give\n  To soothe his soul when thou art gone,\nBut wreaths of hope for aye to live,\n  And thoughts of good together done.\n\nThat so, before the judgment-seat,\n  Though changed and glorified each face,\nNot unremembered ye may meet\n  For endless ages to embrace."}
