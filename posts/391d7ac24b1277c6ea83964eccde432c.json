{"subject": "Taxi Suite (Excerpt: 1. After Anacreon)", "text": "When I drive cab\nI am moved by strange whistles and wear a hat\n\nWhen I drive cab\nI am the hunter. My prey leaps out from where it\nhid, beguiling me with gestures\n\nWhen I drive cab\nall may command me, yet I am in command of all who do\n\nWhen I drive cab\nI am guided by voices descending from the naked air\n\nWhen I drive cab\nA revelation of movement comes to me. They wake now.\nNow they want to work or look around. Now they want\ndrunkenness and heavy food. Now they contrive to love.\n\nWhen I drive cab\nI bring the sailor home from the sea. In the back of\nmy car he fingers the pelt of his maiden\n\nWhen I drive cab\nI watch for stragglers in the urban order of things.\n\nWhen I drive cab\nI end the only lit and waitful things in miles of\ndarkened houses"}
