{"subject": "Her Eyes", "text": "Up from the street and the crowds that went, \nMorning and midnight, to and fro, \nStill was the room where his days he spent, \nAnd the stars were bleak, and the nights were slow. \n\nYear after year, with his dream shut fast, \nHe suffered and strove till his eyes were dim, \nFor the love that his brushes had earned at last, -- \nAnd the whole world rang with the praise of him. \n\nBut he cloaked his triumph, and searched, instead, \nTill his cheeks were sere and his hairs were gray. \n\"There are women enough, God knows,\" he said. . . . \n\"There are stars enough -- when the sun's away.\" \n\nThen he went back to the same still room \nThat had held his dream in the long ago, \nWhen he buried his days in a nameless tomb, \nAnd the stars were bleak, and the nights were slow. \n\nAnd a passionate humor seized him there -- \nSeized him and held him until there grew \nLike life on his canvas, glowing and fair, \nA perilous face -- and an angel's, too. \n\nAngel and maiden, and all in one, -- \nAll but the eyes. -- They were there, but yet \nThey seemed somehow like a soul half done. \nWhat was the matter? Did God forget? . . . \n\nBut he wrought them at last with a skill so sure \nThat her eyes were the eyes of a deathless woman, -- \nWith a gleam of heaven to make them pure, \nAnd a glimmer of hell to make them human. \n\nGod never forgets. -- And he worships her \nThere in that same still room of his, \nFor his wife, and his constant arbiter \nOf the world that was and the world that is. \n\nAnd he wonders yet what her love could be \nTo punish him after that strife so grim; \nBut the longer he lives with her eyes to see, \nThe plainer it all comes back to him."}
