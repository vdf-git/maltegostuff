{"subject": "Rock-Crystal", "text": "Routine-galled, dulled, by many years cumbered,\nslipping halter holiday-wise,\naway into the west land. \n\nSo much cool green to see; such deep silence\nto hear; clear silence; bright waters;\nsuch deep-green of tree-shade; such chiming\nof gem necklaces - birds shaking,\nconcealed, the leaves with crystal songs. \n\nTo hear, at evening, young mountaineers,\ncome down godlike from sunlit pinnacles,\ntell of prowess and peril, and, taken from pocket,\nshow faceted crystals from high rock-surfaces.  \n\nTo muse: All this, it has been like to crystal,\ncold-dropping waters, clearest bird-voice,\nsheerest silence, light-flashing glacier.\nTo be invited: Please have this crystal. \n\nAnd so, like fay-bestowed flower in the fairy-tale,\nbeauty, fast in a crystal, bearing,\nback to the city. \n\nHumanity has ever found it comfortable\nto render richest experience portable,\nheart to heart with a sign indenture,\nsum up in symbol, most high adventure;\ntill, years gone by, and significance broken,\nfolk ask: What mean you by this token? \n\nLet us in kindness covet for every man\none lovely memory at least in life-span\nfit to be locked up in crystal reliquary,\nso all may see it, yet none see, save he."}
