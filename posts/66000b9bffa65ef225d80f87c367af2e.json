{"subject": "Voices Returning", "text": "VOICES returning, cradle us, cradling voices:\nEchoes extenuated of what we love as it passes,\nBells of mules turning the mountain passes,\n- Voices returning, cradle us, cradling voices.\n\nIntoxicate us, you also, flasks that prison the yore:\nOdours in harvests garnered, fleeces shorn from the hours,\nFlesh of amber and musk, mouths of gillyflowers,\n- Intoxicate us, you also, flasks that prison the yore.\n\nIn this morning of winter, and of shadows chill,\nIn this morning of winter the voice of the lark is still.\n- Voices returning, cradle us, cradling voices.\n\nThe lilies are cut in the garden, and every rose,\nAnd the irises by the waters, waters morose.\n- Intoxicate us, you also, flasks that prison the yore.\n\ntranslated by Jethro Bithell"}
