{"subject": "The Past", "text": "The Past it is fraught with many a feeling\nOf pleasure, of sadness, of joy, and of pain;\nAnd 'tis sweet of an eve when dewdrops are falling,\nTo reflect on the days that can ne'er come again.\n\nThe Past, it is pleasant! Ah, memory recalls\nThe period of childhood, when joyous and free,\nWith innocence crowned, in purity robed,\nWe revelled in gladness and sported in glee.\n\nThe Past, it is saddening! full many a loved one\nThat joined in each pleasure, partook of each pain,\nHave passed on before, to the spirit land flown,\nAnd left us below, till their prize we attain.\n\nThe Past's irrevocable! every word we've spoken,\nOr action committed, been stamp'd with its seal\nImmortal, enduring, 'twill stand sure forever,\nAs no time can efface, nor effulgence reveal.\n\nThen, then, should the Present be valued and used\nAs a boon from the Author and Giver of gifts;\nThat so, when 'tis past, we could always enjoy\nThe pleasant assurance of its being well spent."}
