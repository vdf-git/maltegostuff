As easy as your ABC's \nBut first let me explain \nA scene that made a hundred feel \nlike they were ordained \nWe took our children numbering nine \nto a fancy restaurant to dine \nBustling &amp; scurrying.  \nNot the children hurrying \nAs the waiters brought the food \nnine small voices rang out clear  \nMuch to their parent's fear Bless us oh! Lord and these thy gifts \nWhich we are about to receive from Thy Bounty \nThrough Christ our Lord Amen. \nSilence fell on the room like thunder \nAs one hundred stared in wonder \nThen one by one  \nthey also bowed their heads in prayer \nBefore resuming their meal,  \nthey just had to share"}
