{"subject": "Ballad Xx", "text": "All things rejoice this month of May\nExcept, alas, it seems, for me!\nWho have not him with me today\nI once had, so sigh so softly.\nHe was my dear love, sweet to see,\nAnd now he\u2019s so far removed.\nAlas! Come soon, again, my love.\n\nOn the fresh turf let\u2019s go and play, \nIn this sweet month of greenery,\nWhere we shall hear the nightingale,\nAnd many a lark, sing joyfully,\nYou know where. Once more my plea\nIn truest tones, ah me, I move.\n\u2018Alas! Come soon, again, my love.\u2019\n\nFor in this month where Love displays\nMany a prize, there\u2019s a duty\nOn him who loves to joy today\nWith the darling who\u2019s his lady:\nAnd not a day, it seems to me,\nOr half a day, himself remove.\nAlas! Come soon, again, my love.\n\nMy heart\u2019s breaking, for love of you:\nAlas! Come soon, again, my love."}
