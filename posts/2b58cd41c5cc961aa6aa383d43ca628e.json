{"subject": "Sonnet", "text": "Oh, for some honest lover's ghost,\nSome kind unbodied post\nSent from the shades below!\nI strangely long to know\nWhether the noble chaplets wear\nThose that their mistress' scorn did bear\nOr those that were used kindly.\n\nFor whatsoe'er they tell us here\nTo make those sufferings dear,\n'Twill there, I fear, be found\nThat to the being crowned\nT' have loved alone will not suffice,\nUnless we also have been wise\nAnd have our loves enjoyed.\n\nWhat posture can we think him in\nThat, here unloved, again\nDeparts, and 's thither gone\nWhere each sits by his own?\nOr how can that Elysium be\nWhere I my mistress still must see\nCircled in other's arms?\n\nFor there the judges all are just,\nAnd Sophonisba must\nBe his whom she held dear,\nNot his who loved her here.\nThe sweet Philoclea, since she died,\nLies by her Pirocles his side,\nNot by Amphialus.\n\nSome bays, perchance, or myrtle bough\nFor difference crowns the brow\nOf those kind souls that were\nThe noble martyrs here;\nAnd if that be the only odds,\n(As who can tell?) ye kinder gods,\nGive me the woman here!"}
