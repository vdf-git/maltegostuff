{"subject": "Christmas Time", "text": "It's time to give gifts, berries and holly,  \nTis the season to be jolly,  \nSanta works all year round,  \nToys and presents, there's a sled sound,  Taking the list - and checking it twice.  \nCookies, and milk, sugar, and spice,  \nThe smell of evergreens and pine,  \nEggnog, punch, and cranberry wine,  Music that fills the air at night,  \nCarolers\u2019 singing, with much delight,  \nCovering the miles, with new fallen snow,  \nSending cards to those we know.  The trees are frosted, the scenery all white,  \nThe manger is lit, with a glow of light,  \nChildren are snuggled up, stories are told,  \nTreasures to keep, have and to hold."}
