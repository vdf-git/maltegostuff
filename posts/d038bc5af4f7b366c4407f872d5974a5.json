{"subject": "A Father's Tribute", "text": "I don't know what they'll put him at, or what\n        his post may be;\n    I cannot guess the task that waits for him across\n        the sea,\n    But I have known him through the years, and\n        when there's work to do,\n    I know he'll meet his duty well, I'll swear that\n        he'll be true.\n\n    I sometimes fear that he may die, but never that\n        he'll shirk;\n    If death shall want him death must go and take\n        him at his work;\n    This splendid sacrifice he makes is filled with\n        terrors grim,\n    And I have many thoughts of fear, but not one\n        fear of him.\n\n    The foe may rob my life of joy, the foe may\n        take my all,\n    And desolate my days shall be if he shall have to\n        fall.\n    But this I know, whate'er may be the grief that\n        I must face,\n    Upon his record there will be no blemish of\n        disgrace.\n\n    His days have all been splendid days, there lies\n        no broken trust\n    Along the pathway of his youth to molder in\n        the dust;\n    Honor and truth have marked his ways, in him\n        I can be glad;\n    He is as fine and true a son as ever a father had."}
