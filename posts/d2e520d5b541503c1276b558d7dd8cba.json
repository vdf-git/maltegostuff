{"subject": "Ossian's Hymn To The Sun", "text": "O Thou whose beams the sea-gift earth array,\nKing of the sky, and father of the day!\nO sun! what fountain hid from human eyes,\nSupplies thy circle round the radiant skies,\nFor ever burning and for ever bright,\nWith heaven's pure fire, and everlasting light?\nWhat awful beauty in thy face appears!\nImmortal youth, beyond the power of years!\n\nWhen gloomy darkness to thy reign resigns,\nAnd from the gate of morn thy glory shines,\nThe conscious stars are put to sudden flight,\nAnd all the planets hide their heads in night:\nThe queen of heaven forsakes th' ethereal plain,\nTo sink inglorious in the western main.\nThe clouds refulgent deck thy golden throne,\nHigh in the heavens, immortal and alone!\nWho can abide the brightness of thy face!\nOr who attend thee in thy rapid race!\nThe mountain oaks, like their own leaves decay;\nThemselves the mountains wear with age away;\nThe boundless main that rolls from land to land,\nLessens at times, and leaves a waste of sand:\nThe silver moon, refulgent lamp of night,\nIs lost in heaven, and emptied of her light;\nBut thou for ever shalt endure the same,\nThy light eternal, and unspent thy flame.\n\nWhen tempests with their train impend on high,\nDarken the day, and load the labouring sky;\nWhen heaven's wide convex glows with lightnings dire,\nAll ether flaming, and all earth on fire:\nWhen loud and long the deep-mouth'd thunder rolls,\nAnd peals on peals redoubled rend the poles;\nIt from the opening clouds thy form appears,\nHer wonted charm the force of nature wears;\nThy beauteous orb restores departed day,\nLooks from the sky, and laughs the storm away."}
