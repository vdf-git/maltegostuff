{"subject": "On Doctor Gardener", "text": "Gardner told a sad tale of woe, \nHow he was oft o'erwhelmed in snow\nBut was he frightened ? no ! no ! ! no ! ! !\nHe onward cheerfully did go, \nAnd though that he did freeze his cheek \nThe fire side he did never seek,\nBut straight went onward, in his course,\nSo happy, driving his good horse, \nAnd merrily along the way\nThe bells did ring around his sleigh."}
