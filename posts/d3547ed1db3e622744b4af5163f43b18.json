{"subject": "Because Your Eyes Were Two Flames (Verse XIX)", "text": "Because your eyes were two flames\nAnd your brooch wasn't pinned right,\nI thought you had spent the night\nIn playing forbidden games.\n\nBecause you were vile and devious\nSuch deadly hatred I bore you:\nTo see you was to abhor you\nSo lovely and yet so villainous.\n\nBecause a note came to light,\nI know now where you had been,\nAnd what you had done unseen \u2014\nCried for me all the long night."}
