{"subject": "The Rooks", "text": "Lord, when the meadowland is cold, \nand when in the downcast hamlets the long Angeluses are silent.. \ndown on Nature barren of flowers let \nthem sweep from the wide skies, the dear delightful rooks. \n\nStrange army with your stern cries, \nthe cold winds are assaulting your nests! \nYou - along yellowed rivers, over the roads with their old Calvarys, \nover ditches, over holes - disperse! And rally! \n\nIn your thousands, over the fields of France \nwhere the day before yesterday's dead are sleeping, \nwheel in the wintertime, won't you,\nso that each traveler may remember! \n\nBe, then, the one who calls men to duty, \nO funeral black bird of ours! \nBut, ye saints of the sky,\nat the oak tree top, the masthead lost in the enchanted twilight, \nleave alone the warblers of May, for the sake of those whom, \nin the depths of the wood, \nin the undergrowth from which there is no escaping, \ndefeat without a future has enslaved."}
