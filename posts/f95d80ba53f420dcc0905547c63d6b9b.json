{"subject": "Ordeal", "text": "LOVE and pity are pleading with me this hour.\t\n  What is this voice that stays me forbidding to yield,\t\nOffering beauty, love, and immortal power,\t\n  \u00c6ons away in some far-off heavenly field?\t\n\nThough I obey thee, Immortal, my heart is sore.\t        \n  Though love be withdrawn for love it bitterly grieves:\t\nPity withheld in the breast makes sorrow more.\t\n  Oh that the heart could feel what the mind believes!\t\n\nCease, O love, thy fiery and gentle pleading.\t\n  Soft is thy grief, but in tempest through me it rolls.\t        \nDream\u2019st thou not whither the path is leading\t\n  Where the Dark Immortal would shepherd our weeping souls?"}
