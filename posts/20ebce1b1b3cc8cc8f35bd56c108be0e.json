{"subject": "The Family Monkey", "text": "We bought an electric monkey, experimenting rather \nrecklessly with funds carefully gathered since \ngrandfather's time for the purchase of a steam monkey. \n\nWe had either, by this time, the choice of an electric \nor gas monkey. \n\nThe steam monkey is no longer being made, said the monkey \nmerchant. \n\nBut the family always planned on a steam monkey. \n\nWell, said the monkey merchant, just as the wind-up monkey \ngave way to the steam monkey, the steam monkey has given way \nto the gas and electric monkeys. \n\nIs that like the grandfather clock being replaced by the \ngrandchild clock? \n\nSort of, said the monkey merchant. \n\nSo we bought the electric monkey, and plugged its umbilical \ncord into the wall. \n\nThe smoke coming out of its fur told us something was wrong. \n\nWe had electrocuted the family monkey."}
