(Fragment)", "text": "The Moon, how definite its orb! \n   Yet gaze again, and with a steady gaze--\n   'Tis there indeed,--but where is it not?--\n   It is suffused o'er all the sapphire Heaven,\n   Trees, herbage, snake-like stream, unwrinkled Lake,\n   Whose very murmur does of it partake\n   And low and close the broad smooth mountain\n   Is more a thing of Heaven than when\n   Distinct by one dim shade and yet undivided from the universal cloud\n  In which it towers, finite in height."}
