{"subject": "Sonnet: Sesostris", "text": "SOLE Lord of Lords and very King of Kings,\nHe sits within the desert, carved in stone;\nInscrutable, colossal, and alone, \nAnd ancienter than memory of things.\nGraved on his front the sacred beetle clings;\nDisdain sits on his lips; and in a frown\nScorn lives upon his forehead for a crown.\nThe affrighted ostrich dare not dust her wings \nAnear this Presence. The long caravan\u2019s\nDazed camels stop, and mute the Bedouins stare.\nThis symbol of past power more than man\u2019s\nPresages doom. Kings look\u2014and Kings despair:\nTheir sceptres tremble in their jewelled hands, \nAnd dark thrones totter in the baleful air!"}
