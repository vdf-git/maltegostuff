{"subject": "Sonnet 141: In Faith, I Do Not Love Thee With Mine Eyes", "text": "In faith, I do not love thee with mine eyes,\nFor they in thee a thousand errors note;\nBut 'tis my heart that loves what they despise,\nWho in despite of view is pleased to dote.\nNor are mine cars with thy tongue's tune delighted,\nNor tender feeling to base touches prone,\nNor taste, nor smell, desire to be invited\nTo any sensual feast with thee alone;\nBut my five wits, nor my five senses can\nDissuade one foolish heart from serving thee,\nWho leaves unswayed the likeness of a man,\nThy proud heart's slave and vassal wretch to be.\n    Only my plague thus far I count my gain,\n    That she that makes me sin awards me pain."}
