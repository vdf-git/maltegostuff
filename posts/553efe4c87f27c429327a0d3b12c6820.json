{"subject": "Beauty And The Beast", "text": "A Merchant, who by generous pains\nProspered in honourable gains,\nCould boast, his wealth and fame to share,\nThree manly Sons, three Daughters fair;\nWith these he felt supremely blest.-\nHis latest born surpass'd the rest:\nShe was so gentle, good and kind,\nSo fair in feature, form, and mind,\nSo constant too in filial duty,\nThe neighbours called her Little Beauty! \nAnd when fair childhood's days were run,\nThat title still she wore and won;\nLovelier as older still she grew,\nImprov'd in grace and goodness too.-\nHer elder Sisters, gay and vain,\nView'd her with envy and disdain,\nToss'd up their heads with haughty air;\nDress, Fashion, Pleasure, all their care.\n'Twas thus, improving and improv'd;\nLoving, and worthy to be lov'd,\nSprightly, yet grave, each circling day\nSaw Beauty innocently gay.\nThus smooth the May-like moments past;\nBlest times! but soon by clouds o'ercast!\nSudden as winds that madd'ning sweep\nThe foaming surface of the deep,\nVast treasures, trusted to the wave,\nWere buried in the billowy grave!\nOur Merchant, late of boundless store,\nSaw Famine hasting to his door.\nWith willing hand and ready grace,\nMild Beauty takes the Servant's place;\nRose with the sun to household cares,\nAnd morn's repast with zeal prepares,\nThe wholesome meal, the cheerful fire:\nWhat cannot filial love inspire?\nAnd when the task of day was done,\nSuspended till the rising sun,\nMusic and song the hours employ'd,\nAs more deserv'd, the more enjoy'd;\nTill Industry, with Pastime join'd,\nRefresh'd the body and the mind;\nAnd when the groupe retir'd to rest,\nFather and Brothers Beauty blest.\nNot so the Sisters; as before\n'Twas rich and idle, now 'twas poor.\nIn shabby finery array'd,\nThey still affected a parade:\nWhile both insulted gentle Beauty,\nUnwearied in the housewife's duty;\nThey mock'd her robe of modest brown,\nAnd view'd her with a taunting frown;\nYet scarce could hold their rage to see\nThe blithe effects of Industry.\nIn this retreat a year had past,\nWhen happier tidings came at last,\nAnd in the Merchant's smile appear'd\nProspects that all the Cotters cheer'd:\nA letter came; its purport good;\nPart of his ventures brav'd the flood:\n'With speed,' said he, 'I must to town,\n'And what, my girls, must I bring down?'\nThe envious Sisters, all confusion,\nCommissions gave in wild profusion;\nCaps, hats, and bonnets, bracelets, broaches,\nTo cram the pockets of the coaches,\nWith laces, linens, to complete\nThe order, and to fill the seat.\nSuch wants and wishes now appear'd,\nTo make them larger Beauty fear'd;\nYet lest her silence might produce\nFrom jealous Sisters more abuse,\nConsiderately good, she chose,\nThe emblem of herself,-a Rose.\nThe good man on his journey went,\nHis thoughts on generous Beauty bent.\n'If Heav'n,' he said, and breath'd a prayer,\n'If Heav'n that tender child should spare,\n'Whate'er my lot, I must be bless'd,\n'I must be rich:'-he wept the rest.\nTimely such feelings!-Fortune still,\nUnkind and niggard, crost his will.\nOf all his hopes, alas, the gains\nWere far o'erbalanc'd by the pains;\nFor after a long tedious round,\nHe had to measure back his ground.\nA short day's travel from his Cot,\nNew misadventures were his lot;\nDark grew the air, the wind blew high,\nAnd spoke the gathering tempest nigh;\nHail, snow, and night-fog join'd their force,\nBewildering rider and his horse.\nDismay'd, perplext, the road they crost,\nAnd in the dubious maze were lost.\nWhen glimmering through the vapours drear,\nA taper shew'd a dwelling near.\nAnd guess our Merchant's glad surprise,\nWhen a rich palace seemed to rise\nAs on he mov'd! The knee be bent,\nThankful to Heaven; then nearer went.\nBut, O! how much his wonder grew,\nWhen nothing living met his view!-\nEntering a splendid hall, he found,\nWith every luxury around,\nA blazing fire, a plenteous board,\nA costly cellaret, well stor'd,\nAll open'd wide, as if to say,\n'Stranger, refresh thee on thy way!'\nThe Merchant to the fire drew near,\nDeeming the owner would appear,\nAnd pardon one who, drench'd in rain,\nUnask'd, had ventured to remain.\nThe court-yard clock had number'd seven,\nWhen first he came; but when eleven\nStruck on his ear as mute he sate,\nIt sounded like the knoll of Fate.\nAnd yet so hungry was he grown,\nHe pick'd a capon to the bone;\nAnd as choice wines before him stood,\nHe needs must taste if they were good:\nSo much he felt his spirits cheer'd-\nThe more he drank, the less he fear'd.\nNow bolder grown, he pac'd along,\n(Still hoping he might do no wrong),\nWhen, entering at a gilded door,\nHigh-rais'd upon a sumptuous floor,\nA sofa shew'd all Persia's pride,\nAnd each magnificence beside:\nSo down at once the Merchant lay,\nTir'd with the wonders of the day.\nBut had it been a rushy bed,\nTuck'd in the corner of a shed,\nWith no less joy had it been press'd:\nThe good man pray'd, and sank to rest.\nNor woke he till the noon of day;\nAnd as he thus enchanted lay,\n'Now for my storm-sopp'd clothes,' he cries:\nWhen lo! a suit complete he spies;\n'Yes, 'tis all fairy-work, no doubt,\n'By gentle Pity brought about!'\nTenfold, when risen, amazement grew;\nFor bursting on his gazing view,\nInstead of snow, he saw fair bowers\nIn all the pride of summer flowers.\nEntering again the hall, behold,\nServ'd up in silver, pearl, and gold,\nA breakfast, form'd of all things rare,\nAs if Queen Mab herself were there.\nAs now he past, with spirits gay,\nA shower of Roses strew'd the way,\nE'en to his hand the branches bent:\n'One of these boughs-I go content!\n'Beauty, dear Beauty-thy request\n'If I may bear away, I'm blest.'\nThe Merchant pull'd-the branches broke!-\nA hideous growling while he spoke,\nAssail'd his startled ears; and then\nA frightful Beast, as from a den,\nRushing to view, exclaimed, 'Ingrate!\n'That stolen branch has seal'd thy fate.\n'All that my castle own'd was thine,\n'My food, my fire, my bed, my wine:\n'Thou robb'st my Rose-trees in return,\n'For this, base Plunderer, thou shalt mourn!'\n'My Lord, I swear upon my knees,\n'I did not mean to harm your trees;\n'But a lov'd Daughter, fair as spring,\n'Intreated me a Rose to bring;\n'O didst thou know, my lord, the Maid!'-\n'I am no Lord,' Beast angry said,\n'And so no flattery!-but know,\n'If, on your oath before you go,\n'Within three wasted Moons you here\n'Cause that lov'd Daughter to appear,\n'And visit Beast a volunteer\n'To suffer for thee, thou mayest live:-\n'Speak not!-do this!-and I forgive.'\nMute and deprest the Merchant fled,\nUnhappy traveller, evil sped!\nBeauty was first her sire to meet,\nSpringing impatient from her seat;\nHer Brothers next assembled round;\nHer straying Sisters soon were found.\nWhile yet the Father fondly press'd\nThe Child of Duty to his Breast,-\n'Accept these Roses, ill-starr'd Maid!\n'For thee thy Father's life is paid.'\nThe Merchant told the tale of Beast;\nAnd loud lamentings, when he ceas'd,\nFrom both the jealous Sisters broke,\nAs thus with taunting rage they spoke:\n'And so thou kill'st thy Father, Miss,\n'Proud, sinful creature, heardst thou this?\n'We only wish'd a few new clothes;\n'Beauty, forsooth, must have her Rose!\n'Yet, harden'd Wretch, her eyes are dry,\n'Tho' for her Pride our Sire must die!'\n'Die! Not for worlds!' exclaim'd the Maid;\n'Beast kindly will take me instead:\n'And O, a thousand deaths I'd prove\n'To shew my Father how I love!'\nThe Brothers cried, 'Let us away,\n'We'll perish, or the Monster slay.'\n'Vain hope, my gen'rous Sons, his power\n'Can troops of men and horse devour:\n'Your offer, Beauty, moves my soul;\n'But no man can his fate controul:\n'Mine was the fault; you, Love, are free;\n'And mine the punishment shall be.'\nBeauty was firm! the Sire caress'd\nAgain his Darling to his breast;\nWith blended love and awe survey'd,\nAnd each good Brother blest the Maid!\nThree months elaps'd, her Father's heart\nHeav'd high, as she prepar'd to part;\nThe Sisters try'd a tear to force,\nWhile Beauty smil'd as she took horse;\nYet smil'd thro' many a generous tear,\nTo find the parting moment near!\nAnd just as evening's shades came on,\nThe splendid Palace court they won.\nBeauty, now lost in wonder all,\nGain'd with her Sire the spacious hall;\nWhere, of the costliest viands made,\nBehold, a sumptuous table laid!\nThe Merchant, sickening at the sight,\nSat down with looks of dire affright,\nBut nothing touch'd; tho' Beauty prest,\nAnd strove to lull his fears to rest.\nJust as she spoke, a hideous noise\nAnnounc'd the growling monster's voice.\nAnd now Beast suddenly stalk'd forth,\nWhile Beauty well nigh sank to earth:\nScarce could she conquer her alarms,\nTho' folded in a father's arms.\nGrim Beast first question'd fierce, if she\nHad hither journey'd willingly?\n'Yes,' Beauty cried-in trembling tone:\n'That's kind,' said Beast, and thus went on-\n'Good Merchant, at to-morrow's dawn,\n'I charge and warn you to be gone!\n'And further, on life's penalty,\n'Dare not again to visit me.\n'Beauty, farewell!' he now withdrew,\nAs she return'd the dread adieu.\nEach then their separate pillow prest,\nAnd slumber clos'd their eyes in rest.\nAs zephyr light, from magic sleep,\nSoon as the sun began to peep,\nSprang Beauty; and now took her way\nTo where her anguish'd father lay,-\nBut envious time stole swiftly on;\n'Begone! lov'd Father! ah! begone!\n'The early dew now gems the thorn,\n'The sun-beams gain upon the morn.\n'Haste, Father, haste! Heaven guards the good!'\nIn wonder rapt the Merchant stood;\nAnd while dread fears his thoughts employ,\nA child so generous still was joy.\n'My Father's safe!' she cried, 'blest Heaven!\n'The rest is light, this bounty given.'\nShe now survey'd th' enchanting scene,\nSweet gardens of eternal green;\nMirrors, and chandeliers of glass,\nAnd diamonds bright which those surpass;\nAll these her admiration gain'd;\nBut how was her attention chain'd,\nWhen she in golden letters trac'd,\nHigh o'er an arch of emeralds plac'd,\n'Beauty's apartment! Enter, blest!\n'This, but an earnest of the rest!'\nThe fair one was rejoic'd to find,\nBeast studied less her eye, than mind.\nBut, wishing still a nearer view,\nForth from the shelves a book she drew,\nIn whose first page, in lines of gold,\nShe might heart-easing words behold:\n'Welcome Beauty, banish fear!\n'You are Queen, and Mistress here:\n'Speak your wishes, speak your will,\n'Swift obedience meets them still.'\n'Alas!' said she, with heartfelt sighs,\nThe daughter rushing to her eyes,\n'There's nothing I so much desire,\n'As to behold my tender Sire.'\nBeauty had scarce her wish express'd,\nWhen it was granted by the Beast:\nA wond'rous mirror to her eye,\nBrought all her cottage family.\nHere her good Brothers at their toil,\nFor still they dress'd the grateful soil;\nAnd there with pity she perceiv'd,\nHow much for her the Merchant griev'd;\nHow much her Sisters felt delight\nTo know her banish'd from their sight,\nAltho' with voice and looks of guile,\nTheir bosoms full of joy the while,\nThey labour'd hard to force a tear,\nAnd imitate a grief sincere.\nAt noon's repast, she heard a sound\nBreathing unseen sweet music round;\nBut when the evening board was spread,\nThe voice of Beast recall'd her dread:\n'May I observe you sup?' he said;\n'Ah, tremble not; your will is law;\n'One question answer'd, I withdraw.-\n'Am I not hideous to your eyes?'\n'Your temper's sweet,' she mild replies.\n'Yes, but I'm ugly, have no sense:'-\n'That's better far, than vain pretence.'-\n'Try to be happy, and at ease,'\nSigh'd Beast, 'as I will try to please.'-\n'Your outward form is scarcely seen\n'Since I arriv'd, so kind you've been.'\nOne quarter of the rolling year,\nNo other living creature near,\nBeauty with Beast had past serene,\nSave some sad hours that stole between.\nThat she her Father's life had sav'd,\nUpon her heart of hearts was grav'd:\nWhile yet she view'd the Beast with dread,\nThis was the balm that conscience shed.\nBut now a second solace grew,\nWhose cause e'en conscience scarcely knew.\nHere on a Monster's mercy cast,-\nYet, when her first dire fears were past,\nShe found that Monster, timid, mild,\nLed like the lion by the child.\nCustom and kindness banish'd fear;\nBeauty oft wish'd that Beast were near.\nNine was the chosen hour that Beast \nConstant attended Beauty's feast,\nYet ne'er presum'd to touch the food,\nSat humble, or submissive stood,\nOr, audience crav'd, respectful spoke,\nNor aim'd at wit, or ribald joke,\nBut oftner bent the raptur'd ear\nOr ravish'd eye, to see or hear.\nAnd if th' appointed hour pass'd by,\n'Twas marked by Beauty with a sigh.\n'Swear not to leave me,' sigh'd the Beast:\n'I swear'-for now her fears were ceas'd,\n'And willing swear,-so now and then\n'I might my Father see again-\n'One little week-he's now alone.'\n'Granted!' quoth Beast: your will be done!'\n'Your Ring upon the table lay\n'At night,-you're there at peep of day:\n'But oh,-remember, or I die!'\nHe gaz'd, and went without reply.\nAt early morn, she rang to rise;\nThe Maid beholds with glad surprise:\nSummons her Father to her side,\nWho, kneeling and embracing, cried,\nWith rapture and devotion wild,\n'O bless'd be Heaven, and blest my Child!'\nBeauty the Father now address'd,\nAnd strait to see her Sisters press'd.\nThey both were married, and both prov'd\nNeither was happy or belov'd.\nAnd when she told them she was blest\nWith days of ease, and nights of rest;\nTo hide the malice of the soul,\nInto the garden sly they stole,\nAnd there in floods of tears they vent\nTheir hate, and feel its punishment.\n'If,' said the eldest, 'you agree,\n'We'll make that wench more curs'd than we!\n'I have a plot, my sister dear:\n'More than her week let's keep her here.\n'No more with Monster shall she sup,\n'Who, in his rage, shall eat her up.'\nAnd now such art they both employ'd,\nWhile Beauty wept, yet was o'erjoy'd;\nAnd when the stated hour was come,-\n'Ah! can you quit so soon your home?'\nEager they question'd-tore their hair-\nAnd look'd the Pictures of Despair.\nBeauty, tho' blushing at delay,\nPromis'd another week to stay.\nMeantime, altho' she err'd from love,\nHer conscious heart could ill approve-\n'Thy vow was giv'n, thy vow was broke!'\nThus Conscience to her bosom spoke.\nThoughts such as these assail'd her breast,\nAnd a sad vision broke her rest!\nThe palace-garden was the place,\nWhich her imaginations trace:\nThere, on a lawn, as if to die,\nShe saw poor Beast extended lie,\nReproaching with his latest breath\nBeauty's ingratitude in death.\nRous'd from her sleep, the contrite Maid\nThe Ring upon her toilette laid,\nAnd Conscience gave a sound repose:\nBalmy her rest; and when she rose,\nThe palace of poor Beast she found,\nGroves, gardens, arbours, blooming round:\nThe morning shone in summer's pride,\nBeauty for fairer evening sigh'd-\nSigh'd for the object once so fear'd,\nBy worth, by kindness now endear'd.\nBut when had past the wonted hour,\nAnd no wish'd footstep pass'd the door;-\nWhen yet another hour lagg'd on,-\nThen to the wide canal she ran:\n'For there in vision,' said the fair,\n'Was stretch'd the object of my care!'\nAnd there, alas! he now was found,\nExtended on the flowery ground.\n'Ah! fond and faithful Beast,' she cried,\n'Hast thou for me perfidious died?\n'O! could'st thou hear my fervid prayer,\n''Twould ease the anguish of despair.'\nBeast open'd now his long-clos'd eyes,\nAnd saw the fair with glad surprise.\n'In my last moments you are sent;\n'You pity, and I die content.'\n'Thou shalt not die,' rejoin'd the Maid;\n'O rather live to hate, upbraid-\n'But no! my grievous fault forgive!\n'I feel I can't without thee live.'\nBeauty had scarce pronounc'd the word,\nWhen magic sounds of sweet accord,\nThe music of celestial spheres\nAs if from seraph harps she hears;\nAmaz'd she stood,-new wonders grew;\nFor Beast now vanish'd from her view;\nAnd, lo! a Prince, with every grace\nOf figure, fashion, feature, face,\nIn whom all charms of Nature meet,\nWas kneeling at fair Beauty's feet.\n'But where is Beast?' still Beauty cried:\n'Behold him here!' the Prince replied.\n'Orasmyn, lady, is my name,\n'In Persia not unknown to fame;\n'Till this re-humanizing hour,\n'The victim of a Fairy's pow'r;-\n'Till a deliverer could be found,\n'Who, while the accursed spell still bound,\n'Could first endure, tho' with alarm,\n'And break at last by love the charm!'\nBeauty delighted gave her hand,\nAnd bade the Prince her fate command;\nThe Prince now led through rooms of state,\nWhere Beauty's family await,\nIn bridal vestments all array'd,\nBy some superior power convey'd.\n'Beauty,' pronounc'd a heavenly voice,\n'Now take from me your princely choice.\n'Virtue, to every good beside\n'While wit and beauty were denied,\n'Fix'd your pure heart! for which, unseen,\n'I led your steps; and now a Queen,\n'Seated on Persia's glittering throne,\n''Tis mine and Virtue's task to crown!\n'But as for you, ye Sisters vain,\n'Still first and last in envy's train,\n'Before fair Beauty's Palace-gate,\n'Such Justice has decreed your fate,\n'Transform'd to statues you must dwell,\n'Curs'd with the single power, to feel-\n'Unless by penitence and prayer-\n'But this will ask long years of care,\n'Of promise and performance too,\n'A change of mind from false to true-\n'A change I scarce can hope from you.'\nInstant the Power stretch'd forth her wand,\nHer sceptre of supreme command,\nWhen lo! at her resistless call,\nGay crowds came thronging through the hall,\nThe blissful hour to celebrate\nWhen Persia's Prince resum'd his state:\nAt once the dome with music rang,\nAnd virgins danc'd, and minstrels sang;\nIt was the Jubilee of Youth,\nLed on by Virtue and by Truth;\nThe pride of Persia fill'd the scene,\nTo hail Orasmyn and his Queen!\nTHE END"}
