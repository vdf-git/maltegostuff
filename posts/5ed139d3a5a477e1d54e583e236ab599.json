{"subject": "The Second Hymn; Being A Dialogue Between Three Shepherds", "text": "Where is this blessed Babe \nThat hath made \nAll the world so full of joy \nAnd expectation; \nThat glorious Boy \nThat crowns each nation \nWith a triumphant wreath of blessedness? \nWhere should He be but in the throng, \nAnd among \nHis angel-ministers, that sing \nAnd take wing \nJust as may echo to His voyce, \nAnd rejoyce \nWhen wing and tongue and all \nMay so procure their happiness? \nBut He hath other waiters now; \nA poor cow, \nAn ox and mule stand and behold, \nAnd wonder, \nThat a stable should enfold \nHim that can thunder. \n\nChorus.\nO what a gracious God have we! \nHow good? how great? Even as our misery."}
