{"subject": "Song For A German Air", "text": "Fair stream of the mountain, brightly flowing \n   Between thy fresh margins, gay with flowers, \nLife's uncertain visions showing; \n   Thus, like thy waters glide past the hours. \n        Oft on thy sunny banks I lie \n        And mark the waves that glitter by \nWith fleeting joy and brightness glowing. \n\nFair stream! when no more near thee reclining, \n   I gaze and lament for moments gone\u2014 \nCold and silent, past repining\u2014 \n   Still thy clear way thou wilt murmur on: \n         Still will thy roses bloom anew, \n         Though I no more their beauty view, \nAnd yonder sun as bright be shining!"}
