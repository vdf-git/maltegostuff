{"subject": "A Rule Of Life", "text": "'If you want to annoy an opponent thoroughly, and even to harm him,' said a\ncrafty old knave to me, 'you reproach him with the very defect or vice you\nare conscious of in yourself. Be indignant\u2026 and reproach him!\n\n'To begin with, it will set others thinking you have not that vice.\n\n'In the second place, your indignation may well be sincere\u2026. You can turn\nto account the pricks of your own conscience.\n\nIf you, for instance, are a turncoat, reproach your opponent with having no\nconvictions!\n\n'If you are yourself slavish at heart, tell him reproachfully that he is\nslavish\u2026 the slave of civilisation, of Europe, of Socialism!'\n\n'One might even say, the slave of anti-slavishness,' I suggested.\n\n'You might even do that,' assented the cunning knave."}
