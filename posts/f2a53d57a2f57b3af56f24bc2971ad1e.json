{"subject": "Long Summer Afternoon", "text": "(for Gr\u00e1inne) \n\nAs you sleep, \nyour tanned pelt \nglowing against lemon sheets, \na warm southern wind \nwhips a sprinkling of rain \nthrough the open window: \nA blind cartographer \nmapping you with kisses. \nIn the name of memory, \nI claim that quicksilver \ntrickle of sweat; \nits sinuous track \ndown into the small \nof your back; \nits slight tickling \nat the top \nof your buttocks; \nits happy drip \ninto fragrant darkness. \nThree days, \ntwo showers later, \nyour smell fades \nfrom my skin \nand I submerge without trace \nin the grubby quotidian. \nThen, one morning, \nseveral weeks after, \nI pull on my grey sweater - \nthe very one you pressed \ninto service as a nightgown - \nand suddenly inhale you \nall over again."}
