{"subject": "The Palace Gate", "text": "'Halt, who goes there?' ''Tis for the new-born king,\nIn long processions see what gifts we bring.\nHere cometh Care with sheaf of troubled years,\nAnd here is Grief with dish of women's tears.\nFrail Glory, too, holds out her heavy crown,\nAnd Joy comes pale with merry eyes cast down,\nSweet Love drags slow by passion's eager feet\nTo make alarm into a swift retreat,\nHere Marriage leads the law-selected wife,\nAnd yonder Death with the assassin's knife.'\n\nAnd as they stood before the palace gate,\nNow all disturbed to wonder and to wait.\nA little ghost from out the palace ran\nAnd through the crowd to force his way began,\nTheir mourning garments beat about his face.\nHe thrust black Care and Glory from their place,\nLove took one hand, the other held by Joy,\nWho ran to safety with the pretty boy.\n\nThen soon from far came laughter strangely sweet\nAnd on the floor of Heaven running feet.\n\nThe soldier closed the clanging palace gate\nUpon the crowd who murmured still to wait.\n'Take back your gifts, you may not pass,' he said.\n'Hear the bell toll\u2014the little king is dead.'"}
