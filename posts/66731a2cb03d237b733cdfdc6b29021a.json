{"subject": "Lines", "text": "Suggested by the Assaults made on the Negro Soldiers as they passed through the south on their way to and from our war with Spain.\n\nHow I love my country you have heard,\nAnd I would you were noble and free\nIn spirit and deed, as in word,\nAnd your boasted humanity.\nI love you, my country, I do, - \nHere's a heart, a soul that is thine,\nPregnant with devotion for you,\nAnd blind to your faults as to mine.\nThe standard of morals is high;\nWhen fixed by my brother for me,\nIt goes towering up to the sky\nWith a dazzling purity.\nFor a bench he sits on a skull,\nAnd is a judge austere and stern,\nWith whom my demurrers are null,\nAnd my pleadings, though just, are spurned.\nI've carried your flag to the front\nThrough pestilence, battles and storms;\nOf the carnage of war took the blunt,\nObeyed your command, 'Carry arms!'\nAnd gone with you down to the death,\nWith the thorns of caste on my head;\nDefended your home and your hearth,\nAnd wept o'er the bier of your dead.\nAs the smoke of the fight goes by,\nAnd the bugle calls to repose,\nBy my countryman's hands I die,\nAs well as by the hands of its foes;\nYet I love you, my country, I do,\nHere's a heart, a soul that is thine,\nPregnant with devotion for you,\nAnd blind to your faults as to mine."}
