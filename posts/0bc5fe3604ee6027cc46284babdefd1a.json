{"subject": "Songs Of Joy", "text": "Sing out, my soul, thy songs of joy; \nSing as a happy bird will sing \nBeneath a rainbow's lovely arch \nIn the spring.\n\nThink not of death in thy young days; \nWhy shouldst thou that grim tyrant fear? \nAnd fear him not when thou art old, \nAnd he is near.\n\nStrive not for gold, for greedy fools \nMeasure themselves by poor men never; \nTheir standard still being richer men, \nMakes them poor ever.\n\nTrain up thy mind to feel content, \nWhat matters then how low thy store? \nWhat we enjoy, and not possess, \nMakes rich or poor.\n\nFilled with sweet thought, then happy I \nTake not my state from other's eyes; \nWhat's in my mind -- not on my flesh \nOr theirs -- I prize.\n\nSing, happy soul, thy songs of joy; \nSuch as a Brook sings in the wood, \nThat all night has been strengthened by \nHeaven's purer flood."}
