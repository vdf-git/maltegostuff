{"subject": "Joy Of My Life While Left Me Here!", "text": "Joy of my life while left me here!\nAnd still my love!\nHow in thy absence thou dost steer\nMe from above!\nA life well led\nThis truth commends,\nWith quick or dead\nIt never ends.\n\nStars are of mighty use; the night\nIs dark, and long;\nThe road foul; and where one goes right,\nSix may go wrong.\nOne twinkling ray,\nShot o'er some cloud,\nMay clear much away,\nAnd guide a crowd.\n\nGod's saints are shining lights: who stays\nHere long must pass\nO'er dark hills, swift streams, and steep ways\nAs smooth as glass;\nBut these all night,\nLike candles, shed\nTheir beams, and light\nUs into bed.\n\nThey are, indeed, our pillar-fires,\nSeen as we go;\nThey are that city's shining spires\nWe travel to:\nA swordlike gleam\nKept man for sin\nFirst \nout\n; this beam\nWill guide them \nin."}
