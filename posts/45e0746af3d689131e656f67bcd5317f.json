{"subject": "A Scrawl", "text": "I want to sing something-- but this is all--\nI try and I try, but the rhymes are dull\nAs though they were damp, and the echoes fall\nLimp and unlovable.\n\nWords will not say what I yearn to say--\nThey will not walk as I want them to,\nBut they stumble and fall in the path of the way\nOf my telling my love for you.\n\nSimply take what the scrawl is worth--\nKnowing I love you as sun the sod\nOn the ripening side of the great round earth\nThat swings in the smile of God."}
