{"subject": "The Fire Bells Are Ringing", "text": "One, two, three--hark, hark, boys!\nOne, two, three, four!\nThe fire-bells are ringing, this wild wintry night;\nThey ask aid from District Thirty-four,\nThere somebody's riches are now taking flight;\nOn flame-wings away, away they soar.\nBut hark!\nWith shriek and wail,\nHow raves the gale!\nLike demon steeds it speeds--\nlike galloping gangs from Pandemonium hurl'd.\nYes, firemen, take courage! did valiant deeds avail,\nThen you were the victors of the world.\n\nRing the bells again!\nWake the electric wire!\nAnd flash abroad the warning words--\n\"FIRE! FIRE!\"\nGod save the city! for man's devices fail\nWhen fierce flames with wintry winds conspire,\nBut hark!\nWith shriek and wail (With shriek and wail!)\nHow raves the gale! (How raves the gale!)\nLike demon steeds it speeds--\nlike galloping gangs from Pandemonium hurl'd.\nYes, firemen, take courage! did valiant deeds avail,\nThen your were the victors of the world.\n\nOne, two, three--hark, hark, boys!\nOne, two, three, four!\nThe fire-bells are ringing, an urgent appeal;\nThe engines go dashing by the door,\nAll safe here, children, no fear need we feel;\nBut God help in District Thirty-four,\nWhat's that?\nLook there! look there!\nA lurid glare\nLights up the sky--aye, aye!\nand columns of red, devouring flame appear.\nAnd see! for departure our neighbors prepare;\nPerchance there is danger even here.\n\nOne, two, three--hark, hark, boys!\nOne, two, three, four!\nThe fire-bells are ringing, a last grand alarm;\nHow vast must the conflagration be!\nOur own roof is blazing! yet where, free from harm,\nOh! where shall we our treasures flee?\nLet's haste!\n'Twill fall! 'Twill fall--\nThat granite wall;\nI see it crumbling, tumbling!\nFly for your lives, from out this fiery grave!\nLaid low, crush'd, buried are some beyond recall;\nBut thank God! my little flock I save."}
