{"subject": "Football", "text": "Just like a football I am and have \nbeen bounced around a bit,\nBut only by chance of fate, no man \nwould get away with it.\n\nThe football suffers silently\nthe grabs, the throws, the kicks.\nI'm not one to take that from \nthe country boobs or the city slicks.\n\nI come from a line of strong women\nwho took on varying roles.\nMy grandma was a marcher \nfor equality at the poles.\n\nGrandma raised her family of five\nafter her young husband died,\nby sheer strong will and hard work\nwith no helpmeet by her side.\n\nMy paternal grandma must have been\na strong willed woman too.\nShe raised a very respectful son\nwho gave womenfolk their due.\n\nMy mama raised four strapping sons\nwithout needing to raise a hand,\nno slaps, no harsh words and no threats\nto make them understand.\n\nShe passed down to her daughter\nunrelenting self respect.\nRough handling me would surely bring \nmore grief than you'd expect. \n\nSo I'm not much like a football\nnor would I ever be\nan uncomplaining plaything\nkicked around so endlessly."}
