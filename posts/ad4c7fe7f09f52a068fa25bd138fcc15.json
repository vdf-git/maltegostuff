{"subject": "The Testimony Of Divine Adoption", "text": "How happy are the new\u2013born race,\nPartakers of adopting grace!\nHow pure the bliss they share!\nHid from the world and all its eyes,\nWithin their heart the blessing lies,\nAnd conscience feels it there.\n\nThe moment we believe, 'tis ours;\nAnd if we love with all our powers\nThe God from whom it came;\nAnd if we serve with hearts sincere,\n'Tis still discernible and clear,\nAn undisputed claim.\n\nBut, ah! if foul and wilful sin\nStain and dishonour us within,\nFarewell the joy we knew;\nAgain the slaves of nature's sway,\nIn labyrinths of our own we stray,\nWithout a guide or clue.\n\nThe chaste and pure, who fear to grieve\nThe gracious Spirit they receive,\nHis work distinctly trace;\nAnd, strong in undissembling love,\nBoldly assert and clearly prove\nTheir hearts his dwelling\u2013place.\n\nOh, messenger of dear delight,\nWhose voice dispels the deepest night,\nSweet peace\u2013proclaiming Dove!\nWith thee at hand, to soothe our pains,\nNo wish unsatisfied remains,\nNo task but that of love.\n\n'Tis love unites what sin divides;\nThe centre, where all bliss resides;\nTo which the soul once brought,\nReclining on the first great cause,\nFrom his abounding sweetness draws\nPeace passing human thought.\n\nSorrow forgoes its nature there,\nAnd life assumes a tranquil air,\nDivested of its woes;\nThere sovereign goodness soothes the breast,\nTill then incapable of rest,\nIn sacred sure repose."}
