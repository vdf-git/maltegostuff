{"subject": "The Nature Of Things", "text": "Whether things are rosy\n or things are sad\n All we can do is live\n one day at a time\n It's often been said\n that the grass is greener\n on the other side\n But what of the fellow\n over there.\n Does he feel any better?\n I often sympathize\n with friends\n Who have lost a loved one\n or who are sick.\n Sharing each other's feelings\n is only showing respect.\n We're not called human\n beings for nothing.\n We're set apart from beast\n We know that love is\n part of us\n From cradle to the grave.\n So live your life\n as best you can\n Share feelings with\n your fellow man\n And strive to enjoy\n \"One day at a time\"."}
