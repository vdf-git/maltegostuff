{"subject": "Farewell", "text": "'Farewell.'\nAh! frown not thus-nor turn from me,\nI must not-dare not-look on thee;\nToo well thou know'st how dear thou art,\n'Tis hard but yet 'tis best to part:\nI wish thee not to share my grief,\nIt seeks, it hopes, for no relief.\n'Farewell.'\nCome give thy hand, what though we part,\nThy name is fixed, within my heart;\nI shall not change, nor break the vow\nI made before and plight thee now;\nFor since thou may'st not live for me,\n'Tis sweeter far to die for thee.\n'Farewell'\nThoult think of me when I am gone\nNone shall undo, what I have done;\nYet even thy love I would resign\nTo save thee from remorse like mine;\nThy tears shall fall upon my grave:\nThey still may bless-they cannot save."}
