{"subject": "It Was a Bichon Fris\u00e9's Life . . .", "text": "Louisiana skies paddle north nodding hello to some exiles \ndisplaced by floodwaters so we all putter in the bisque \nin fretted dresses, alleviated by a fan. But we have nothing on \n\n'Le Matin,' in whose rococo frame a curtain sweeps to bare \na boudoir, a Bichon Fris\u00e9 worrying something between paws, \nbegging the dulcet glance of the mistress whose push-up, \n\ncupless corset and up-drawn stocking border what they \nfall short of, per the stern frame rippling like a cloud! \nEven the candle angles to get a look in the mirror \n\nengloving the scene. Why it is her slipper the bitch clutches!   \nThe gentleman's reverie is elsewhere . . . Loitering \nLouisiana stops to admire this engraving by 'N. Lavreinee.' \n\nWhat a chevalier! It makes the smeariest sunset think \nit's in a Restoration Comedy, in such humidity \nchefs defer meringues. 'Ksar Rouge,' 'Taos Adobe,' \n\n'Gulf Shrimp'\u2014a thousand names of softboiled \nlipsticks fritter English as if it were French, meaning \nmeeting no resistance from the flesh."}
