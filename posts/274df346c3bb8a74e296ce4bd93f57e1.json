{"subject": "On The Return Of The Confederate Flags By Congress", "text": "WE loved the wild clamor of battle, \nThe crash of the musketry's rattle, \nThe bugle and drum. \nWe have drooped in the dust, long and lonely; \nThe blades that flashed joy are rust only, \nThe far-rolling war-music dumb. \n\nGod rest the true souls in death lying, \nFor whom overhead proudly flying \nWe challenged the foe. \nThe storm of the charge we have breasted, \nOn the hearts of our dead we have rested, \nIn the pride of a day, long ago. \n\nAh, surely the good of God's making \nShall answer both those past awaking \nAnd life's cry of pain; \nBut we never more shall be tossing \nOn surges of battle where crossing \nThe swift-flying death-bearers rain. \n\nAgain in the wind we are streaming, \nAgain with the war-lust are dreaming \nThe call of the shell. \nWhat gray heads look up at us sadly? \nAre these the stern troopers who madly \nRod straight at the battery's hell? \n\nNay, more than the living have found us, \nPale spectres of battle surround us; \nThe gray line is dressed. \nYe hear not, but they who are bringing \nYour symbols of honor are singing \nThe song of death's bivouac rest. \n\nBlow forth on the south wind to greet us, \nO star flag! once eager to meet us \nWhen war-lines were set. \nGo carry to far fields of glory \nThe soul-stirring thrill of the story, \nOf days when in anger we met. \n\nAh, well that we hung in the churches \nIn quiet, where God the heart searches, \nThat under us met \nMen heard through the murmur of praying \nThe voice of the torn banners saying, \n'Forgive, but ah, never forget.'"}
