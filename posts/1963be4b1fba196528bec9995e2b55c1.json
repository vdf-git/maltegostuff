{"subject": "Dissolute", "text": "Many years have I still to burn, detained\nLike a candle flame on this body; but I enshine  \nA darkness within me, a presence which sleeps contained\nIn my flame of living, her soul enfolded in mine.  \n\nAnd through these years, while I burn on the fuel of life,\nWhat matter the stuff I lick up in my living flame,  \nSeeing I keep in the fire-core, inviolate,  \nA night where she dreams my dreams for me, ever the same."}
