{"subject": "Song The Seventh", "text": "Yon Alp, he lifts his snowy horn\nTo catch the virgin rose of morn.\n\nClouds in towering tumult loom:\nSunny onsets dash the gloom;\nBold burly March, he laughs to do it;\nYon showery drift, he whistles through it;\nBreaks in wild glee the Rainbow's horns;\nHangs drops of glory on the points of thorns;\nBut, o'er yon sower on the slope,\nBreathes blessing through his thin white dust of hope.\n\nBreezy dapplings to and fro,\nWhat a ferment o'er the meadow!\nO'er the billowy corn they go,\nLight and shadow, light and shadow.\n\nBearded leas embattled stand,\nEmbattled with the hosts of bread.\nFamine has seen and fled.\nThe sower's hand,\nIt saves the land:\nHigh honour to the sower's hand!"}
