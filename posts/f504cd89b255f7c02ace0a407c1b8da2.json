{"subject": "Correspondence", "text": "I have a friend who lives far away \nbut through the mail we seem to say, \nthings each other likes to hear, \nwhat we've been doing throughout the year. \"Do you remember . . . ?\" this, \n\"Do you remember . . . ?\" that, \nIt's like we're having a little chat. When we were young, she lived next door, \nthere were so many things to do and explore, \nand now that I've found my friend again, \nit's great to say \"Remember when . . . ?\""}
