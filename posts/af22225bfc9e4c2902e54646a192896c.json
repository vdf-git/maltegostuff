{"subject": "The Tapestry", "text": "Me, when I think of you I see   \nAlley cats in your kitchen,\nGod weeping at your openings,   \nIndividual acts of imagination, never   \nCulligan men under\nFloorboards slipping hallucinogens into your water.   \nLet me say I have imagined you\nUndressing guests before mirrors\nTo let their dragonfly bodies\nEscape from human shells."}
