{"subject": "Salmon Courage", "text": "Here at Woodlands, Moriah,\nthese thirty-five years later,\nstill I could smell her fear.\nThen, the huddled hills would not have\ncalmed her, now as they do me.\nThen, the view did not snatch\nthe panting breath, now, as it does\nthese thirty-five years later, to the day,\nI relive the journey of my salmon mother.\n\nThis salmon woman of Woodlands, Moriah\ntook the sharp hook of death\nin her mouth, broke free and beat\nher way upstream, uphill; spurned\nall but the challenge of gravity,\nanswered the silver call of the moon,\ndanced to the drag and pull of the\ntides, fate a silver thorn in her side,\nbrought her back here to spawn with\nthe hunchbacked hills humping the horizon,\nunder a careless blue sky.\n\nMy salmon father now talks of how\nhe could walk over there, to those same hills,\nand think and walk some more with his dreams,\nthen that he had,\nnow lost and replaced.\nHis father (was he salmon?)\nweighted him with the millstones of\na teacher's certificate, a plot of land\n(believed them milestones to where he hadn't been),\nthat dragged him downstream to the ocean.\n\nNow, he and his salmon daughter\nface those same huddled, hunchbacked hills.\nShe a millstoned lawyer, his milestone\nto where he hadn't been.\nHe pulls her out, a blood rusted weapon,\nto wield against his friends\n\"This, my daughter, the lawyer!\"\nShe takes her pound of dreams neat,\nno blood under that careless blue sky,\nsuggests he wear a sign around his neck,\n\"My Daughter IS a Lawyer,\"\nand drives the point home,\nquod erat demonstrandum.\n\nBut I will be salmon.\nWasn't it for this he made the journey\ndownstream, my salmon father?\nWhy then do I insist on swimming\nagainst the tide, upstream,\nleaping, jumping, flying floating,\nhurling myself at under, over,\naround all obstacles, backwards\nin time to the spawning\ngrounds of knotted dreams?\nMy scales shed, I am Admiral red,\nbut he, my salmon father, will not\naccept that I too am salmon,\nwhose fate it is to swim against the time,\nwhose lodestar is to be salmon.\n\nThis is called salmon courage my dear father,\nsalmon courage,\nand when I am all spawned out\nlike the salmon, I too must die \u2014 \nbut this child will be born,\nmust be born salmon."}
