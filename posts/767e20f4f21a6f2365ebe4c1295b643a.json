{"subject": "'Nice Kind Germans'", "text": "When Rome, and Rommel, disappoint the foe\nThe Nice Kind German is again on show.\nOn go the sheep-skins, and the wolves protest\nMilk is their diet and they love us best;\nWhile flabby folk compassionately view\nA fellow-being just the same as you.\n\nBut when the random death patrols the sky,\nWhen 'London burns' and 'Victory is nigh',\nThe Nice Kind German rollicks with the rest\nAnd gloating hate commands the lamb-like breast.\nHere's no surprise\u2014and nothing for regret:\nThere was a danger that we might forget.\nJune 25, 1944"}
