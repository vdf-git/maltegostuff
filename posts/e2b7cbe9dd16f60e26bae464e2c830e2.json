{"subject": "A Song Of Another. For Eoghan", "text": "Often enough the leaves have fallen there\nSince life for her was changed to other care;\nOften enough the winds that swept the wave\nAnd mocked my woe, have moaned over her grave.\n\nI will return: Death now can do no more\nAnywhere on these seas or on the shore,\nSince he has stilled her heart. I cannot mourn\nFor her on these wild seas: I will return.\n\nDeath now can do no more. And what but Death\nHas any final power? He ceased her breath,\nStriking her dumb lips pallid; quenched the lights\nThat were, O Death, my stars of the wild nights\nOut on rude ocean -- quenched and closed her eyes\nThat were, O Death, my stars of the dawn-rise!\n\nLong years ago her quiet form was thrust \nInto the quiet earth; low in the dust \nHer golden hair lies tarnished every thread\nThese lone long years, tarnished and dim and dead.\n\nI will return to the far valley, blest\nWith her soul's presence, now her home of rest--\n(Where life was peace to her now death is peace)--\nThere by her grave my pilgrimage may cease;\nThere life, there death, in my vain heart shall stir\nNo passion but the old true love of her."}
