{"subject": "I. H. B: Died, August 11, 1898", "text": "THE DIRGE is sung, the ritual said,\nNo more the brooding organ weeps,\nAnd, cool and green, the turf is spread\nOn that lone grave where BROMLEY sleeps.\n\nGone\u2014in his ripe, meridian hour! \nGone\u2014when the wave was at its crest!\nAnd wayward Humor\u2019s perfect flower\nIs turned to darkness and to rest.\n\nNo more those honest eyes will beam\nWith torrid light of proud desire; \nNo more those fluent lips will teem\nWith Wit\u2019s gay quip or Passion\u2019s fire.\n\nForever gone! And with him fade\nThe dreams that Youth and Friendship know\u2014\nThe frolic and the glee that made \nThe golden time of Long Ago.\n\nThe golden time! Ah, many a face,\u2014\nAnd his the merriest of them all,\u2014\nThat made this world so sweet a place,\nIs cold and still, beneath the pall. \n\nHis was the heart that over-much\nIn human goodness puts its trust,\nAnd his the keen, satiric touch\nThat shrivels falsehood into dust.\n\nHis love was like the liberal air,\u2014 \nEmbracing all, to cheer and bless;\nAnd every grief that mortals share\nFound pity in his tenderness.\n\nHis subtle vision deeply saw,\nThrough piteous webs of human fate, \nThe motion of the sovereign law,\nOn which all tides of being wait.\n\nNo sad recluse, no lettered drone,\nHis mirthful spirit, blithely poured,\nIn many a crescent frolic shone,\u2014 \nThe light of many a festal board.\n\nNo pompous pedant, did he feign,\nWith dull conceit of learning\u2019s store;\nBut not for him were writ in vain\nThe statesman\u2019s craft, the scholar\u2019s lore. \n\nFierce for the right, he bore his part\nIn strife with many a valiant foe;\nBut Laughter winged his polished dart,\nAnd Kindness tempered every blow.\n\nNo selfish purpose marked his way; \nStill for the common good he wrought,\nAnd still enriched the passing day\nWith sheen of wit and sheaves of thought.\n\nShrine him, New-England, in thy breast!\nWith wild-flowers grace his hallowed bed, \nAnd guard with love his laurelled rest,\nForever with thy holiest dead!\n\nFor not in all the teeming years\nOf thy long glory hast thou known\nA being framed of smiles and tears, \nHumor and force, so like thine own!\n\nAnd never did thy asters gleam,\nOr through thy pines the night-wind roll,\nTo soothe, in death\u2019s transcendent dream,\nA sweeter or a nobler soul!"}
