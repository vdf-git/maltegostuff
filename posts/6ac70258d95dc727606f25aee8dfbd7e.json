{"subject": "The Saginaw Song", "text": "In Saginaw, in Saginaw, \nThe wind blows up your feet, \nWhen the ladies\u2019 guild puts on a feed, \nThere\u2019s beans on every plate, \nAnd if you eat more than you should, \nDestruction is complete. \nOut Hemlock Way there is a stream \nThat some have called Swan Creek; \nThe turtles have bloodsucker sores, \nAnd mossy filthy feet; \nThe bottoms of migrating ducks \nCome off it much less neat. \nIn Saginaw, in Saginaw, \nBartenders think no ill; \nBut they\u2019ve ways of indicating when \nYou are not acting well: \nThey throw you through the front plate glass \nAnd then send you the bill. \nThe Morleys and the Burrows are \nThe aristocracy; \nA likely thing for they\u2019re no worse \nThan the likes of you or me,\u2014 \nA picture window\u2019s one you can\u2019t \nRaise up when you would pee. \nIn Shaginaw, in Shaginaw \nI went to Shunday Shule; \nThe only thing I ever learned \nWas called the Golden Rhule,\u2014 \nBut that\u2019s enough for any man \nWhat\u2019s not a proper fool. \nI took the pledge cards on my bike; \nI helped out with the books; \nThe stingy members when they signed \nMade with their stingy looks,\u2014 \nThe largest contributions came \nFrom the town\u2019s biggest crooks. \nIn Saginaw, in Saginaw, \nThere\u2019s never a household fart, \nFor if it did occur, \nIt would blow the place apart,\u2014 \nI met a woman who could break wind \nAnd she is my sweet-heart. \nO, I\u2019m the genius of the world,\u2014 \nOf that you can be sure, \nBut alas, alack, and me achin\u2019 back, \nI\u2019m often a drunken boor; \nBut when I die\u2014and that won\u2019t be soon\u2014 \nI\u2019ll sing with dear Tom Moore, \nWith that lovely man, Tom Moore. \n\nCoda: \nMy father never used a stick, \nHe slapped me with his hand; \nHe was a Prussian through and through \nAnd knew how to command; \nI ran behind him every day \nHe walked our greenhouse land. \nI saw a figure in a cloud, \nA child upon her breast, \nAnd it was O, my mother O, \nAnd she was half-undressed, \nAll women, O, are beautiful \nWhen they are half-undressed."}
