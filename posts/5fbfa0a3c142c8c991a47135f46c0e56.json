{"subject": "Dancing Adairs", "text": "Behold me, in my chiffon, gauze, and tinsel, \nFlitting out of the shadow into the spotlight, \nAnd into the shadow again, without a whisper!- \nFirefly's my name, I am evanescent.\n\nFirefly's your name. You are evanescent. \nBut I follow you as remorselessly as darkness, \nAnd shut you in and enclose you, at last, and always, \nTill you are lost,-as a voice is lost in silence.\n\nTill I am lost, as a voice is lost in silence. . . \nAre you the one who would close so cool about me? \nMy fire sheds into and through you and beyond you: \nHow can your fingers hold me? I am elusive.\n\nHow can my fingers hold you? You are elusive? \nYes, you are flame, but I surround and love you, \nAlways extend beyond you, cool, eternal, \nTo take you into my heart's great void of silence.\n\nYou shut me into your heart's great void of silence. . . \nO sweet and soothing end for a life of whirling! \nNow I am still, whose life was mazed with motion. \nNow I sink into you, for love of sleep."}
