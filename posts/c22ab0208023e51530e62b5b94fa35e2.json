{"subject": "Once Upon A Time.....", "text": "ONCE upon a time rare flowers grew\nOn every shrub and bush we used to see; \nThe skies above our heads were always blue, \nThe woods held secrets deep for you and me;\nThe hillsides had their caves where tales were told\nOf swart-cheeked pirates from a far-off clime,\nWhen cutlases were fierce and rovers bold - \nDon't you remember? - Once upon a time.\n\nOnce upon a time from sun to sun \nThe hours were full of joy - there was no care,\nAnd webs of gaudy dreams in air were spun\nOf deeds heroic and of fortunes fair;\nThe jangling schoolhouse bell was all the woe \nOur spirits knew, and in its tuneless chime.\nWas all the sorrow of the long ago-\nDon't you remember? - Once upon a time.\n\nOnce upon a time the witches rode\nIn sinister and ominous parade\nUpon their sticks at night, and queer lights glowed \nWith eerie noises by the goblins made;\nAnd many things mysterious there were .\nFor boyish cheeks to pale at through the grime\nThat held them brown; and shadows queer would stir- \nDon't you remember? - Once upon a time.\n\nOnce upon a time our faith was vast\nTo compass all the things on sea and land\nThat boys have trembled o'er for ages past, \nNor ever could explain or understand,\nAnd in that faith found happiness too deep\nFor all the gifted tongues of prose or rime,\nAnd joys ineffable we could not keep -\nDon't you remember? - Once upon a time."}
