{"subject": "Crib Of Sun", "text": "He faked a letter to god\nand slept whole night.\n(Fallen in a creek from a moving train.) \nIndeed, he saddled himself with luxury\nof oblivion.\nThe success around him was most obstinate.\n\nPretending to condone the arthritis\nof social limbs, he walked straight\nto become what he would be, \na fakir among riches without fanfare. The \nabsolute renunciation, slapping the door \u2013\nshut, for blackness.\n\nIt was visible, the nakedness of brazen lies\nfalling like cottonwool around him. He touched\ncoral eyes of truth and wept, never to speak\nagain. Cosmos would split\nfor his journey to home.\n\nThis was meant for you, he said to himself.\nYour own choosing without any regrets.\nHis fingers traced the figure of a mother\nof the thin moon, who was assaulting\nthe crib of sun."}
