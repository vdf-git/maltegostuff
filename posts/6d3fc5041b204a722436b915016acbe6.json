{"subject": "Autumn Interlude", "text": "I said goodbye to the bees last Friday week,\nTo blooms, and to things like these, for Winter bleak\nWas shouting loud from the hills, and flinging high\nHis gossamer net that fills frail Autumn's sky.\nSo I said goodbye to the bees; for I knew that soon\nI should bask no more 'neath the trees on some high noon\nAnd hark to the drowsy hum close overhead.\nFor the cold and rain must come, now Summer's dead.\n\nSo I wallowed a while in woe and wooed unease;\nAnd I rather liked it so; for it seemed to please\nSome clamoring inner urge - some need apart,\nAnd I felt self-pity surge, here, in my heart\nAs I said goodbye to the bees, my tireless friends\nWho toil mid the flowers and the trees till daylight ends \nWho toil in the sun, yet seem to find no irk,\nWhile I loll in the shade and dream; for I do love work.\n\nAh, fate and the falling leaf!  How dear is woe.\nHow subtly sweet is grief (Synthetic).  So\nI said goodbye to the bees; and then I wrote\nThis crown of threhodies, while in my throat\nI choked back many a sob and salt tears spent.\nBut I felt I'd done my job, and was content.\nFor I'd penned my piece to the bees - the poet's tosh\nOf the Autumn's drear unease.  Ah, me!  Oh, gosh!\n\nI said goodbye to the bees last Friday week....\nThen the tempest shook the trees, the swollen creek\nWent thundering down to the plain, the wind shrieked past,\nAnd the cold, and the wet, wet rain were here at last....\nThen, a hot sun, scorning rules, shone forth, alack!\nAnd those blundering, blithering fools, the bees came back,\nHumming a song inance in the rain-washed trees. . . .\nNow it's all to do again. . . . Oh, blast the bees!"}
