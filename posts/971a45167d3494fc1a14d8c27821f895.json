{"subject": "Lord Lundy Ii - Second Canto", "text": "It happened to Lord Lundy then, \nAs happens to so many men: \nTowards the age of twenty-six, \nThey shoved him into politics; \nIn which profession he commanded \nThe Income that his rank demanded \nIn turn as Secretary for \nIndia, the Colonies, and War. \nBut very soon his friends began \nTo doubt is he were quite the man: \nThus if a member rose to say \n(As members do from day to day), \n'Arising out of that reply . . .!' \nLord Lundy would begin to cry. \nA Hint at harmless little jobs \nWould shake him with convulsive sobs. \nWhile as for Revelations, these \nWould simply bring him to his knees, \nAnd leave him whimpering like a child. \nIt drove his colleagues raving wild! \nThey let him sink from Post to Post, \nFrom fifteen hundred at the most \nTo eight, and barely six-and then \nTo be Curator of Big Ben!. . . \nAnd finally there came a Threat \nTo oust him from the Cabinet! \n\nThe Duke - his aged grand-sire - bore \nThe shame till he could bear no more. \nHe rallied his declining powers, \nSummoned the youth to Brackley Towers, \nAnd bitterly addressed him thus- \n'Sir! you have disappointed us! \nWe had intended you to be \nThe next Prime Minister but three: \nThe stocks were sold; the Press was squared: \nThe Middle Class was quite prepared. \nBut as it is! . . . My language fails! \nGo out and govern New South Wales!' \n\nThe Aged Patriot groaned and died: \nAnd gracious! how Lord Lundy cried!"}
