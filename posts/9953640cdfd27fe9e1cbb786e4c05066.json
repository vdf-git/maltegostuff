{"subject": "There's No To-Morrow", "text": "Two long had Lov'd, and now the Nymph desir'd, \nThe Cloak of Wedlock, as the Case requir'd; \nUrg'd that, the Day he wrought her to this Sorrow, \nHe Vow'd, that he wou'd marry her To-Morrow. \nAgen he Swears, to shun the present Storm, \nThat he, To-Morrow, will that Vow perform. \nThe Morrows in their due Successions came; \nImpatient still on Each, the pregnant Dame \nUrg'd him to keep his Word, and still he swore the same. \nWhen tir'd at length, and meaning no Redress, \nBut yet the Lye not caring to confess, \nHe for his Oath this Salvo chose to borrow, \nThat he was Free, since there was no To-Morrow; \nFor when it comes in Place to be employ'd, \n'Tis then To-Day; To-Morrow's ne'er enjoy'd. \n\nThe Tale's a Jest, the Moral is a Truth; \nTo-Morrow and To-Morrow, cheat our Youth: \nIn riper Age, To-Morrow still we cry, \nNot thinking, that the present Day we Dye; \nUnpractis'd all the Good we had Design'd; \nThere's No To-Morrow to a Willing Mind."}
