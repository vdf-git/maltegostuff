{"subject": "The Solitary-Hearted", "text": "SHE was a queen of noble Nature's crowning, \nA smile of hers was like an act of grace; \nShe had no winsome looks, no pretty frowning, \nLike daily beauties of the vulgar race: \nBut if she smiled, a light was on her face, \nA clear, cool kindliness, a lunar beam \nOf peaceful radiance, silvering o'er the stream \nOf human thought with unabiding glory; \nNot quite a waking truth, not quite a dream, \nA visitation, bright and transitory. \n\nBut she is changed,--hath felt the touch of sorrow, \nNo love hath she, no understanding friend; \nO grief! when Heaven is forced of earth to borrow \nWhat the poor niggard earth has not to lend; \nBut when the stalk is snapt, the rose must bend. \nThe tallest flower that skyward rears its head \nGrows from the common ground, and there must shed \nIts delicate petals. Cruel fate, too surely, \nThat they should find so base a bridal bed, \nWho lived in virgin pride, so sweet and purely. \n\nShe had a brother, and a tender father, \nAnd she was loved, but not as others are \nFrom whom we ask return of love,--but rather \nAs one might love a dream; a phantom fair \nOf something exquisitely strange and rare, \nWhich all were glad to look on, men and maids, \nYet no one claim'd--as oft, in dewy glades, \nThe peering primrose, like a sudden gladness, \nGleams on the soul, yet unregarded fades;-- \nThe joy is ours, but all its own the sadness. \n\n'Tis vain to say--her worst of grief is only \nThe common lot, which all the world have known; \nTo her 'tis more, because her heart is lonely, \nAnd yet she hath no strength to stand alone,-- \nOnce she had playmates, fancies of her own, \nAnd she did love them. They are past away \nAs Fairies vanish at the break of day; \nAnd like a spectre of an age departed, \nOr unsphered Angel wofully astray, \nShe glides along--the solitary-hearted."}
