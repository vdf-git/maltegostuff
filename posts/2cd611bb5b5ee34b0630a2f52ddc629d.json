{"subject": "Ducks", "text": "The ducks are clacking by the brook;\nThe sun is hot, but cool their feathers look.\nDucks do not plan ambitious schemes:\nTheir commerce is in weeds and streams.\nThey ask, what's life but sparkle and spray\nIn a lazy brook on a lazy day?\nI think, if I were five feet something shorter,\nI might have been a duck upon the water,\nA portly duck, with a shining bill\nYellow and spruce as a daffodil.\nTo me, possessed of an idle mind,\nThat seems a life of the perfect kind.\n\nTwo bicycles plunge into the water -\nTwo boys intending war and slaughter.\nThe brook is shallow here. There is a noise\nOf water, and terror and reckless boys.\nThe stream turns brown with mud. It rocks and heaves,\nThey waddle and cackle in consternation,\nWhile the boys are leaping with jubilation,\nAnd I can see that man and duck\nAre both cursed by a dancing luck."}
