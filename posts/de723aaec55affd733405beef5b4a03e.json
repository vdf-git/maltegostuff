{"subject": "Lightly Come Or Lightly Go", "text": "Lightly come or lightly go: \nThough thy heart presage thee woe, \nVales and many a wasted sun, \nOread let thy laughter run, \nTill the irreverent mountain air \nRipple all thy flying hair. \n\nLightly, lightly -- - ever so: \nClouds that wrap the vales below \nAt the hour of evenstar \nLowliest attendants are; \nLove and laughter song-confessed \nWhen the heart is heaviest."}
