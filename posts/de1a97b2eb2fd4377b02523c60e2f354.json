{"subject": "The Kalevala - Rune Xxxvi", "text": "KULLERWOINEN'S VICTORY AND DEATH.\nKullerwionen, wicked wizard,\nIn his purple-colored stockings,\nNow prepares himself for battle;\nGrinds a long time on his broadsword,\nSharpens well his trusty weapon,\nAnd his mother speaks as follows:\n'Do not go, my son beloved,\nGo not to the wars, my hero,\nStruggle not with hostile spearsmen.\nWhoso goes to war for nothing,\nUndertakes a fearful combat,\nUndertakes a fatal issue;\nThose that war without a reason\nWill be slaughtered for their folly,\nEasy prey to bows and arrows.\nGo thou with a goat to battle,\nShouldst thou go to fight the roebuck,\n'Tis the goat that will be vanquished,\nAnd the roebuck will be slaughtered;\nWith a frog thou'lt journey homeward,\nVictor, with but little honor!'\nThese the words of Kullerwoinen:\n'Shall not journey through the marshes,\nShall not sink upon the heather,\nOn the home-land of the raven,\nWhere the eagles scream at day-break.\nWhen I yield my life forever,\nBravely will I fall in battle,\nFall upon the field of glory,\nBeautiful to die in armor,\nAnd the clang and clash of armies,\nBeautiful the strife for conquest!\nThus Kullervo soon will hasten\nTo the kingdom of Tuoni,\nTo the realm of the departed,\nUndeformed by wasting sickness.'\nThis the answer of the mother:\n'If thou diest in the conflict,\nWho will stay to guard thy father,\nWho will give thy sire protection?'\nThese the words of Kullerwoinen:\n'Let him die upon the court-yard,\nSleeping out his life of sorrow!'\n'Who then will protect thy mother,\nBe her shield in times of danger?'\n'Let her die within the stable,\nOr the cabin where she lingers!'\n'Who then will defend thy brother,\nGive him aid in times of trouble?'\n'Let him die within the forest,\nSleep his life away unheeded!'\n'Who will comfort then thy sister,\nWho will aid her in affliction?'\n'Let her sink beneath the waters,\nPerish in the crystal fountain,\nWhere the brook flows on in beauty,\nLike a silver serpent winding\nThrough the valley to the ocean!'\nThereupon the wild Kullervo\nHastens from his home to battle,\nTo his father speaks, departing:\n'Fare thou well, my aged father!\nWilt thou weep for me, thy hero,\nWhen thou hearest I have perished,\nFallen from thy tribe forever,\nPerished on the field of glory?'\nThus the father speaks in answer:\n'I shall never mourn the downfall\nOf my evil son, Kullervo;\nShall not weep when thou hast perished;\nShall beget a second hero\nThat will do me better service,\nThat will think and act in wisdom.'\nKullerwoinen gives this answer:\n'Neither shall I mourn thy downfall,\nShall not weep when thou hast perished;\nI shall make a second father,\nMake the head from loam and sandstone,\nMake the eyes from swamp-land berries,\nMake the beard from withered sea-grass,\nMake the feet from roots of willow,\nMake the form from birch-wood fungus.'\nThereupon the youth, Kullervo,\nTo his brother speaks as follows:\n'Fare thou well, beloved brother!\nWilt thou weep for me departed,\nShouldst thou hear that I have perished,\nFallen on the field of battle?'\nThis the answer of the brother:\n'I shall never mourn the downfall\nOf my brother, Kullerwoinen,\nShall not weep when thou hast perished;\nI shall find a second brother '\nFind one worthier and wiser!'\nThis is Kullerwoinen's answer:\n'Neither shall I mourn thy downfall,\nShall not weep when thou hast perished;\nI shall form a second brother,\nMake the head from dust and ashes,\nMake the eyes from pearls of ocean,\nMake the beard from withered verdure,\nMake the form from pulp of birch-wood.'\nTo his sister speaks Kullervo:\n'Fare thou well, beloved sister!\nSurely thou wilt mourn my downfall,\nWeep for me when I have perished,\nWhen thou hearest I have fallen\nIn the heat and din of battle,\nFallen from thy race forever!'\nBut the sister makes this answer:\n'Never shall I mourn thy downfall,\nShall not weep when thou hast perished;\nI shall seek a second brother,\nSeek a brother, purer, better,\nOne that will not shame his sister!'\nKullerwoinen thus makes answer:\n'Neither shall I mourn thee fallen,\nShall not weep when thou hast perished;\nI shall form a second sister,\nMake the head from whitened marble,\nMake the eyes from golden moonbeams,\nMake the tresses from the rainbow,\nMake the ears from ocean-flowers,\nAnd her form from gold and silver.\n'Fare thou well, beloved mother,\nMother, beautiful and faithful!\nWilt thou weep when I have perished,\nFallen on the field of glory,\nFallen from thy race forever?'\nThus the mother speaks in answer:\n'Canst not fathom love maternal,\nCanst not smother her affection;\nBitterly I'll mourn thy downfall,\nI would weep if thou shouldst perish,\nShouldst thou leave my race forever;\nI would weep in court or cabin,\nSprinkle all these fields with tear-drops,\nWeep great rivers to the ocean,\nWeep to melt the snows of Northland,\nMake the hillocks green with weeping,\nWeep at morning, weep at evening,\nWeep three years in bitter sorrow\nO'er the death of Kullerwoinen!'\nThereupon the wicked wizard\nWent rejoicing to the combat;\nIn delight to war he hastened\nO'er the fields, and fens, and fallows,\nShouting loudly on the heather,\nSinging o'er the hills and mountains,\nRushing through the glens and forests,\nBlowing war upon his bugle.\nTime had gone but little distance,\nWhen a messenger appearing,\nSpake these words to Kullerwoinen:\n'Lo! thine aged sire has perished,\nFallen from thy race forever;\nHasten home and do him honor,\nLay him in the lap of Kalma.'\nKullerwoinen inade this answer:\n'Has my aged father perished,\nThere is home a sable stallion\nThat will take him to his slumber,\nLay him in the lap of Kalma.'\nThen Kullervo journeyed onward,\nCalling war upon his bugle,\nTill a messenger appearing,\nBrought this word to Kullerwoinen:\n'Lo! thy brother too has perished,\nDead he lies within the forest,\nManalainen's trumpet called him;\nHome return and do him honor,\nLay him in the lap of Kalma.'\nKullerwoinen thus replying:\n'Has my hero-brother perished,\nThere is home a sable stallion\nThat will take him' to his slumber,\nLay him in the lap of Kalma.'\nYoung Kullervo journeyed onward\nOver vale and over mountain,\nPlaying on his reed of battle,\nTill a messenger appearing\nBrought the warrior these tidings:\n'Lo! thy sister too has perished,\nPerished in the crystal fountain,\nWhere the waters flow in beauty,\nLike a silver serpent winding\nThrough the valley to the ocean;\nHome return and do her honor,\nLay her in the lap of Kalma.'\nThese the words of Kullerwoinen:\n'Has my beauteous sister perished,\nFallen from my race forever,\nThere is home a sable filly\nThat will take her to her resting,\nLay her in the lap of Kalma.'\nStill Kullervo journeyed onward,\nThrough the fens he went rejoicing,\nSounding war upon his bugle,\nTill a messenger appearing\nBrought to him these words of sorrow:\n'Lo! thy mother too has perished,\nDied in anguish, broken-hearted;\nHome return and do her honor,\nLay her in the lap of Kalma.'\nThese the measures of Kullervo:\n'Woe is me, my life hard-fated,\nThat my mother too has perished,\nShe that nursed me in my cradle,\nMade my couch a golden cover,\nTwirled for me the spool and spindle!\nLo! Kullervo was not present\nWhen his mother's life departed;\nMay have died upon the mountains,\nPerished there from cold and hunger.\nLave the dead form of my mother\nIn the crystal waters flowing;\nWrap her in the robes of ermine,\nTie her hands with silken ribbon,\nTake her to the grave of ages,\nLay her in the lap of Kalma.\nBury her with songs of mourning,\nLet the singers chant my sorrow;\nCannot leave the fields of battle\nWhile Untamo goes unpunished,\nFell destroyer of my people.'\nKullerwoinen journeyed onward,\nStill rejoicing, to the combat,\nSang these songs in supplication:\n'Ukko, mightiest of rulers,\nLoan to me thy sword of battle,\nGrant to me thy matchless weapon,\nAnd against a thousand armies\nI will war and ever conquer.'\nUkko, gave the youth his broadsword,\nGave his blade of magic powers\nTo the wizard, Kullerwoinen.\nThus equipped, the mighty hero\nSlew the people of Untamo,\nBurned their villages to ashes;\nOnly left the stones and ovens,\nAnd the chimneys of their hamlets.\nThen the conqueror, Kullervo,\nTurned his footsteps to his home-land,\nTo the cabin of his father '\nTo his ancient fields and forests.\nEmpty did he find the cabin,\nAnd the forests were deserted;\nNo one came to give him greeting,\nNone to give the hand of welcome;\nLaid his fingers on the oven,\nBut he found it cold and lifeless;\nThen he knew to satisfaction\nThat his mother lived no longer;\nLaid his hand upon the fire-place,\nCold and lifeless were the hearth-stones;\nThen he knew to satisfaction\nThat his sister too had perished;\nThen he sought the landing-places,\nFound no boats upon the rollers;\nThen he knew to satisfaction\nThat his brother too had perished;\nThen he looked upon the fish-nets,\nAnd he found them torn and tangled;\nAnd he knew to satisfaction\nThat his father too had perished.\nBitterly he wept and murmured,\nWept one day, and then a second,\nOn the third day spake as follows:\n'Faithful mother, fond and tender,\nWhy hast left me here to sorrow\nIn this wilderness of trouble?\nBut thou dost not hear my calling,\nThough I sing in magic accents,\nThough my tear-drops speak lamenting,\nThough my heart bemoans thine absence.\nFrom her grave awakes the mother,\nTo Kullervo speaks these measures:\n'Thou has still the dog remaining,\nHe will lead thee to the forest;\nFollow thou the faithful watcher,\nLet him lead thee to the woodlands,\nTo the farthest woodland border,\nTo the caverns of the wood-nymphs;\nKullerwoinen's Victory and Death\nThere the forest maidens linger,\nThey will give thee food and shelter,\nGive my hero joyful greetings.'\nKullerwoinen, with his watch-dog,\nHastens onward through the forest,\nJourneys on through fields and fallows;\nJourneys but a little distance,\nTill be comes upon the summit\nWhere he met his long-lost sister;\nFinds the turf itself is weeping,\nFinds the glen-wood filled with sorrow,\nFinds the heather shedding tear-drops,\nWeeping are the meadow-flowers,\nO'er the ruin of his sister.\nKullerwoinen, wicked wizard,\nGrasps the handle of his broadsword,\nAsks the blade this simple question:\n'Tell me, O my blade of honor,\nDost thou wish to drink my life-blood,\nDrink the blood of Kullerwoinen?'\nThus his trusty sword makes answer,\nWell divining his intentions:\nWhy should I not drink thy life-blood,\nBlood of guilty Kullerwoinen,\nSince I feast upon the worthy,\nDrink the life-blood of the righteous?'\nThereupon the youth, Kullervo,\nWicked wizard of the Northland,\nLifts the mighty sword of Ukko,\nBids adieu to earth and heaven;\nFirmly thrusts the hilt in heather,\nTo his heart he points the weapon,\nThrows his weight upon his broadsword,\nPouring out his wicked life-blood,\nEre be journeys to Manala.\nThus the wizard finds destruction,\nThis the end of Kullerwoinen,\nBorn in sin, and nursed in folly.\nWainamoinen, ancient minstrel,\nAs he hears the joyful tidings,\nLearns the death of fell Kullervo,\nSpeaks these words of ancient wisdom:\n'O, ye many unborn nations,\nNever evil nurse your children,\nNever give them out to strangers,\nNever trust them to the foolish!\nIf the child is not well nurtured,\nIs not rocked and led uprightly,\nThough he grow to years of manhood,\nBear a strong and shapely body,\nHe will never know discretion,\nNever eat. the bread of honor,\nNever drink the cup of wisdom.'"}
