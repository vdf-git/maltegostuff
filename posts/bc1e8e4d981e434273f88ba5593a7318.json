{"subject": "Ghosts", "text": "I to a crumpled cabin came\nupon a hillside high,\nAnd with me was a withered dame\nAs weariful as I.\n\"It used to be our home,\" she said;\n\"How well I remember well!\nOh that our happy hearth should be\nToday an empty shell!\"\n\nThe door was flailing in the storm\nThat deafed us with its din;\nThe roof that kept us once so warm\nNow let the snow-drift in.\nThe floor sagged to the sod below,\nThe walls caved crazily;\nWe only heard the wind of woe\nWhere once was glow and glee.\n\nSo there we stood disconsolate\nBeneath the Midnight Dome,\nAnd ancient miner and his mate,\nBefore our wedded home,\nWhere we had know such love and cheer . . .\nI sighed, then soft she said:\n\"Do not regret - remember, dear,\n                                    We, too, are dead.\""}
