{"subject": "The Mystic Sea", "text": "The smell of the sea in my nostrils,\nThe sound of the sea in mine ears;\nThe touch of the spray on my burning face,\nLike the mist of reluctant tears.\n\nThe blue of the sky above me,\nThe green of the waves beneath;\nThe sun flashing down on a gray-white sail\nLike a scimitar from its sheath.\n\nAnd ever the breaking billows,\nAnd ever the rocks' disdain;\nAnd ever a thrill in mine inmost heart\nThat my reason cannot explain.\n\nSo I say to my heart, 'Be silent,\nThe mystery of time is here;\nDeath's way will be plain when we fathom the main,\nAnd the secret of life be clear.'"}
