{"subject": "An October Evening", "text": "1     The woods are haggard and lonely,\n2         The skies are hooded for snow, \n3     The moon is cold in Heaven, \n4         And the grasses are sere below.\n\n5     The bearded swamps are breathing\n6         A mist from meres afar, \n7     And grimly the Great Bear circles\n8         Under the pale Pole Star. \n\n9     There is never a voice in Heaven, \n10       Nor ever a sound on earth, \n11   Where the spectres of winter are rising\n12       Over the night's wan girth. \n\n13   There is slumber and death in the silence, \n14       There is hate in the winds so keen; \n15   And the flash of the north's great sword-blade\n16       Circles its cruel sheen. \n\n17   The world grows ag\u00e8d and wintry, \n18       Love's face peak\u00e8d and white; \n19   And death is kind to the tired ones\n20       Who sleep in the north to-night."}
