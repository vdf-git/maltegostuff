{"subject": "Taking Off My Clothes", "text": "I take off my shirt, I show you. \nI shaved the hair out under my arms. \nI roll up my pants, I scraped off the hair   \non my legs with a knife, getting white. \n\nMy hair is the color of chopped maples.   \nMy eyes dark as beans cooked in the south.   \n(Coal fields in the moon on torn-up hills) \n\nSkin polished as a Ming bowl \nshowing its blood cracks, its age, I have hundreds   \nof names for the snow, for this, all of them quiet. \n\nIn the night I come to you and it seems a shame   \nto waste my deepest shudders on a wall of a man. \n\nYou recognize strangers, \nthink you lived through destruction. \nYou can't explain this night, my face, your memory. \n\nYou want to know what I know?   \nYour own hands are lying."}
