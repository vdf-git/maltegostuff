{"subject": "On Mrs. Ar: F: Leaving London", "text": "From Town fair Arabella flies,\nThe Beaux unpowder'd grieve,\nThe Rivers play before her eyes,\nThe Breezes softly breathing rise\nThe Spring begins to live. \nHer Lovers swore they must expire\nYet quickly find their Ease,\nFor as she goes, their Flames retire\nLove thrives before a nearer fire\nEsteem by distant Rays.\nYet soon the Fair one will return\nWhen Summer quits the Plain\nYe Rivers pour the weeping Urn,\nYe Breezes sadly sighing mourn,\nYe Lovers burn again.\n'Tis constancy enough in Love\nThat Nature's fairly shewn\nTo search for more will fruitless prove\nRomances and the Turtle Dove\nThe Virtue boast alone."}
