{"subject": "The Sea-Shore", "text": "I SHOULD like to dwell where the deep blue sea \nRock'd to and fro as tranquilly,\nAs if it were willing the halcyon's nest\nShould shelter through summer its beautiful guest.\nWhen a plaining murmur like that of a song,\nAnd a silvery line come the waves along:\nNow bathing\u2014now leaving the gentle shore,\nWhere shining sea-shells lay scattered o'er.\n\nAnd children wandering along the strand,\nWith the eager eye and the busy hand,\nHeaping the pebbles and green sea-weed,\nLike treasures laid up for a time of need.\nOr tempting the waves with their daring feet,\nTo launch, perhaps, some tiny fleet:\nMimicking those which bear afar\nThe wealth of trade\u2014and the strength of war.\n\nI should love, when the sun-set reddened the foam,\nTo watch the fisherman's boat come home,\nWith his well-filled net and glittering spoil:\nWell has the noon-tide repaid its toil.\nWhile the ships that lie in the distance away\nCatch on their canvass the crimsoning ray;\nLike fairy ships in the tales of old,\nWhen the sails they spread were purple and gold.\n\nThen the deep delight of the starry night,\nWith its shadowy depths and dreamy light:\nWhen far away spreads the boundless sea,\nAs if it imaged infinity.\nLet me hear the winds go singing by,\nLulling the waves with their melody:\nWhile the moon like a mother watches their sleep,\nAnd I ask no home but beside the deep."}
