{"subject": "Where Lies The Land To Which Yon Ship Must Go?", "text": "WHERE lies the Land to which yon Ship must go?\nFresh as a lark mounting at break of day,\nFestively she puts forth in trim array;\nIs she for tropic suns, or polar snow?\nWhat boots the inquiry?--Neither friend nor foe\nShe cares for; let her travel where she may,\nShe finds familiar names, a beaten way\nEver before her, and a wind to blow.\nYet still I ask, what haven is her mark?\nAnd, almost as it was when ships were rare, \n(From time to time, like Pilgrims, here and there\nCrossing the waters) doubt, and something dark,\nOf the old Sea some reverential fear,\nIs with me at thy farewell, joyous Bark!"}
