{"subject": "Why I Voted The Socialist Ticket", "text": "I am unjust, but I can strive for justice. \nMy life's unkind, but I can vote for kindness. \nI, the unloving, say life should be lovely. \nI, that am blind, cry out against my blindness. \n\nMan is a curious brute \u2014 he pets his fancies \u2014 \nFighting mankind, to win sweet luxury. \nSo he will be, tho' law be clear as crystal, \nTho' all men plan to live in harmony. \n\nCome, let us vote against our human nature, \nCrying to God in all the polling places \nTo heal our everlasting sinfulness \nAnd make us sages with transfigured faces."}
