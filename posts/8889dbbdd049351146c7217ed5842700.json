{"subject": "Psyche ; Or, The Legend Of Love: Canto Vi.", "text": "When pleasure sparkles in the cup of youth, \nAnd the gay hours on downy wing advance, \nOh! then \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctis sweet to hear the lip of truth \nBreathe the soft vows of love, sweet to entrance \nThe raptured soul by intermingling glance \nOf mutual bliss; sweet amid roseate bowers, \nLed by the hand of Love, to weave the dance, \nOr unmolested crop life's fairy flowers, \nOr bask in joy's bright sun through calm unclouded hours. \nYet they, who light of heart in may-day pride \nMeet love with smiles and gaily amorous song, \n(Though he their softest pleasures may provide, \nEven then when pleasures in full concert throng) \nThey cannot know with what enchantment strong \nHe steals upon the tender suffering soul, \nWhat gently soothing charms to him belong, \nHow melting sorrow owns his soft control, \nSubsiding passions hushed in milder waves to roll. \n\nWhen vexed by cares and harassed by distress, \nThe storms of fortune chill thy soul with dread, \nLet Love, consoling Love! still sweetly bless, \nAnd his assuasive balm benignly shed: \nHis downy plumage o'er thy pillow spread \nShall lull thy weeping sorrows to repose; \nTo Love the tender heart hath ever fled, \nAs on its mother's breast the infant throws \nIts sobbing face, and there in sleep forgets its woes. \n\nOh! fondly cherish then the lovely plant, \nWhich lenient Heaven hath given thy pains to ease; \nIts lustre shall thy summer hours enchant, \nAnd load with fragrance every prosperous breeze, \nAnd when rude winter shall thy roses seize, \nWhen nought through all thy bowers but thorns remain, \nThis still with undeciduous charms shall please, \nScreen from the blast and shelter from the rain, \nAnd still with verdure, cheer the desolated plain. \n\nThrough the hard season Love with plaintive note \nLike the kind red-breast tenderly shall sing, \nWhich swells mid dreary snows its tuneful throat, \nBrushing the cold dews from its shivering wing, \nWith cheerful promise of returning spring \nTo the mute tenants of the leafless grove. \nGuard thy best treasure from the venomed sting \nOf baneful peevishness; oh! never prove \nHow soon ill-temper's power can banish gentle Love! \n\nRepentance may the storms of passion chase, \nAnd Love, who shrunk affrighted from the blast, \nMay hush his just complaints in soft embrace, \nAnd smiling wipe his tearful eye at last: \nYet when the wind's rude violence is past, \nLook what a wreck the scattered fields display! \nSee on the ground the withering blossoms cast! \nAnd hear sad Philomel with piteous lay \nDeplore the tempest's rage that swept her young away. \n\nThe tears capricious beauty loves to shed, \nThe pouting lip, the sullen silent tongue, \nMay wake the impassioned lovers tender dread, \nAnd touch the spring that clasps his soul so strong; \nBut ah, beware! the gentle power too long \nWill not endure the frown of angry strife; \nHe shuns contention, and the gloomy throng \nWho blast the joys of calm domestic life, \nAnd flies when discord shakes her brand with quarrels rife. \n\nOh! he will tell you that these quarrels bring \nThe ruin, not renewal of his flame: \nIf oft repeated, lo! on rapid wing \nHe flies to hide his fair but tender frame; \nFrom violence, reproach, or peevish blame \nIrrevocably flies. Lament in vain! \nIndifference comes the abandoned heart to claim, \nAsserts for ever her repulsive reign, \nClose followed by disgust and all her chilling train. \n\nIndifference, dreaded power! what art shall save \nThe good so cherished from thy grasping hand? \nHow shall young Love escape the untimely grave \nThy treacherous arts prepare? or how withstand \nThe insidious foe, who with her leaden band \nEnchains the thoughtless, slumbering deity? \nAh, never more to wake! or e'er expand \nHis golden pinions to the breezy sky, \nOr open to the sun his dim and languid eye. \n\nWho can describe the hopeless, silent pang \nWith which the gentle heart first marks her sway? \nEyes the sure progress of her icy fang \nResistless, slowly fastening on her prey; \nSees rapture's brilliant colours fade away, \nAnd all the glow of beaming sympathy; \nAnxious to watch the cold averted ray \nThat speaks no more to the fond meeting eye \nEnchanting tales of love, and tenderness, and joy. \n\nToo faithful heart! thou never canst retrieve \nThy withered hopes: conceal the cruel pain! \nO'er thy lost treasure still in silence grieve; \nBut never to the unfeeling ear complain: \nFrom fruitless struggles dearly bought refrain! \nSubmit at once-the bitter task resign, \nNor watch and fan the expiring flame in vain; \nPatience, consoling maid, may yet be thine, \nGo seek her quiet cell, and hear her voice divine! \n\nBut lo! the joyous sun, the soft-breathed gales \nBy zephyrs sent to kiss the placid seas, \nCurl the green wave, and fill the swelling sails; \nThe seamen's shouts, which jocund hail the breeze, \nCall the glad knight the favouring hour to seize. \nHer gentle hostess Psyche oft embraced, \nWho still solicitous her guest to please \nOn her fair breast a talisman had placed, \nAnd with the valued gem her parting blessing graced. \n\nHow gaily now the bark pursues its way \nUrged by the steady gale! while round the keel \nThe bubbling currents in sweet whispers play, \nTheir force repulsive now no more they feel; \nNo clouds the unsullied face of heaven conceal, \nBut the clear azure one pure dome displays, \nWhether it bids the star of day reveal \nHis potent beams, or Cynthia's milder rays \nOn deep cerulean skies invite the eye to gaze. \n\nAlmost unconscious they their course pursue, \nSo smooth the vessel cuts the watery plain; \nThe wide horizon to their boundless view \nGives but the sky, and Neptune's ample reign: \nStill the unruffled bosom of the main \nSmiles undiversified by varying wind; \nNo toil the idle mariners sustain, \nWhile, listless, slumbering o'er his charge reclined, \nThe pilot cares no more the unerring helm to mind. \n\nWith light exulting heart glad Psyche sees \nTheir rapid progress as they quit the shore: \nYet weary languor steals by slow degrees \nUpon her tranquil mind; she joys no more \nThe never changing scene to wander o'er \nWith still admiring eye; the enchanting song \nYields not that lively charm it knew before, \nWhen first enraptured by his tuneful tongue \nShe bad her vocal knight the heavenly strain prolong. \n\nA damp chill mist now deadens all the air, \nA drowsy dullness seems o'er all to creep, \nNo more the heavens their smile of brightness wear, \nThe winds are hushed, while the dim glassy deep \nOppressed by sluggish vapours seems to sleep; \nSee his light scarf the knight o'er Psyche throws, \nSolicitous his lovely charge to keep \nFrom still increasing cold; while deep repose \nBenumbs each torpid sense and bids her eye-lids close. \n\nNow as with languid stroke they ply the oars, \nWhile the dense fog obscures their gloomy way; \nHymen, well used to coast these dangerous shores, \nRoused from the dreaming trance in which he lay, \nCries to the knight in voice of dread dismay, \n'Steer hence thy bark, oh! yet in time beware; \n'Here lies Petrea, which with baneful sway \n'Glacella rules, I feel the dank cold air, \n'I hear her chilling voice, methinks it speaks despair!' \n\nEven while he speaks, behold the vessel stands \nImmoveable! in vain the pilot tries \nThe helm to turn; fixed in the shallow strands, \nNo more obedient to his hand, it lies, \nThe disappointed oar no aid supplies \nWhile sweeping o'er the sand it mocks their force. \nThe anxious knight to Constance now applies, \nTo his oft tried assistance has recourse, \nAnd bids his active mind design some swift resource. \n\nDebating doubtfully awhile they stood, \nAt length on their united strength rely, \nTo force the bark on the supporting flood; \nThey rouse the seamen, who half slumbering lie, \nSubdued and loaded by the oppressive sky. \nThen wading mid the fog, with care explore \nWhat side the deepest waters may supply, \nAnd where the shallows least protect the shore, \nWhile through their darksome search the star sheds light before. \n\nMean time deep slumbers of the vaporous mist \nHang on the heavy eye-lids of the fair; \nAnd Hymen too, unable to resist \nThe drowsy force of the o'erwhelming air, \nLaid at her feet at length forgets his care. \nWhen lo! Glacella's treacherous slaves advance, \nDeep wrapt in thickest gloom; the sleeping fair \nThey seize, and bear away in heedless trance, \nLong ere her guardian knight suspects the bitter chance. \n\nThus the lorn traveller imprudent sleeps \nWhere his high glaciers proud Locendro shews; \nThus o'er his limbs resistless torpor creeps, \nAs yielding to the fatal deep repose \nHe sinks benumbed upon the Alpine snows, \nAnd sleeps no more to wake; no more to view \nThe blooming scenes his native vales disclose, \nOr ever more the craggy path pursue, \nOr o'er the lichened steep the chamois chase renew. \n\nLo! to their queen they bear their sleeping prey, \nDeep in her ice-built castle's gloomy state, \nThere on a pompous couch they gently lay \nPsyche, as yet unconscious of her fate, \nAnd when her heavy eyes half opening late \nDimly observe the strange and unknown scenes, \nAs in a dream she views her changed estate, \nGazing around with doubtful, troubled mien \nNow on the stupid crowd, now on their dull proud queen. \n\nWith vacant smile, and words but half exprest, \nIn one ungracious, never-varying tone, \nGlacella welcomes her bewildered guest, \nAnd bids the chief supporter of her throne \nApproach and make their mighty mistress known, \nProud Selfishness, her dark ill-favoured lord! \nHer gorgeous seat, which still he shared alone, \nHe slowly leaves obedient to her word, \nAnd ever as he moved the cringing train adored. \n\nNought of his shapeless form to sight appears, \nImpenetrable furs conceal each part; \nHarsh and unpleasing sounds in Psyche's ears \nThat voice which had subdued full many a heart; \nWhile he, exerting every specious art, \nPersuades her to adore their queen's control; \nYet would he not Glacella's name impart, \nBut with false title, which she artful stole \nFrom fair Philosophy, deludes the erring soul. \n\n'Rest, happy fair!' he cries, 'who here hast found \n'From all the storms of life a safe retreat, \n'Sorrow thy breast henceforth no more shall wound \n'Nor care invade thee in this quiet seat: \n'The voice of the distressed no more shall meet \n'The sympathizing ear; another's woes \n'Shall never interrupt the stillness sweet, \n'Which here shall hush thee to serene repose, \n'Nor damp the constant joys these scenes for thee disclose. \n\n'Fatigue no more thy soft and lovely frame \n'With vain benevolence and fruitless care; \n'No deep heaved sigh shall here thy pity claim, \n'Nor hateful want demand thy wealth to share; \n'For thee shall Independence still prepare \n'Pleasures unmingled, and for ever sure; \n'His lips our sovereign's peaceful laws declare, \n'Centre existence in thyself secure, \n'Nor let an alien shade thy sunshine e'er obscure.' \n\nHe spoke, and lo! unnumbered doors unfold, \nAnd various scenes of revelry display; \nHere Grandeur sunk beneath the massive gold; \nHere discontented Beauty pined away, \nAnd vainly conscious asked her promised sway; \nHere Luxury prepared his sumptuous feast, \nWhile lurking Apathy behind him lay \nTo poison all the insipid food he drest, \nAnd shake his poppy crown o'er every sated guest. \n\nThe hireling minstrels strike their weary lyre, \nAnd slumber o'er the oft repeated strain; \nNo listless youth to active grace they fire: \nHere Eloquence herself might plead in vain, \nNor one of all the heartless crowd could gain: \nAnd thou, oh! sweeter than the Muses song, \nAffection's voice divine! with cold disdain \nEven thou art heard, while mid the insulting throng \nThe daunted, shivering form moves timidly along! \n\nThus o'er the oiled surface softly slides \nThe unadmitted stream, rapid it flows, \nAnd from the impervious plain pellucid glides; \nRepulsed with gentle murmurs thus it goes, \nTill in the porous earth it finds repose, \nConcealed and sheltered in its parents breast:- \nOh! man's best treasure in this vale of woes! \nStill cheer the sad, and comfort the distrest, \nNor ever be thy voice by selfishness opprest! \n\nPsyche with languid step he leads around, \nAnd bids her all the castle's splendour see. \nHere Dissipation's constant sports abound, \nWhile her loose hand in seeming bounty free, \nHer scentless roses, painted mimicry, \nProfusely sheds; here Pride unheeded tells \nTo nodding crowds his ancient pedigree; \nAnd Folly with reiterated spells \nTo count her spotted cards the yawning group compels. \n\n'See how, attentive to her subjects ease,' \nTo their reluctant prey exclaims her guide, \n'Each fleeting joy of life she bids them seize, \n'Anxious for each gay pastime to provide; \n'See her fast spreading power increasing wide, \n'Adored and worshipped in each splendid dome! \n'Lo! Beauty glows for ever at her side, \n'She bids her cheek the unvarying rose assume; \n'And Bacchus sees for her his votive ivy bloom. \n\n'Is aught then wanting in this fairy bower? \n'Or is there aught which yet thy heart can move?' \nThat heart, unyielding to their sovereign's power, \nIn gentle whispers sighing answers, 'Love!' \nWhile scornful smiles the fond reply reprove, \n'Lo!' he exclaims, 'thy vanquished Cupid view; \n'He oft with powerful arms had vainly strove \n'Our sovereign's rocky fortress to subdue, \n'Now, subject to her reign, he yields obedience due.' \n\nWondering she gazed around, and where he points, \nAn idiot child in golden chains she spies, \nRich cumbrous gems load all his feeble joints, \nA gaudy bandage seels his stupid eyes, \nAnd foul Desire his short-lived torch supplies: \nBy the capricious hand of Fashion led, \nHer sudden starts with tottering step he tries \nSubmissive to attend: him had she bred, \nAnd Selfishness himself the nursling ever fed. \n\nWith lustre false his tinsel arms to deck \nUngraceful ornaments around him shone, \nGifts of his sportive guide; she round his neck \nA glittering cord insultingly had thrown, \nLoading its pendent purse with many a stone \nAnd worthless dross, and ever as he went, \nHis leaden darts, with wanton aim unknown, \nNow here, now there, in careless chance she sent, \nThat oft their blunted force in empty air was spent. \n\nShocked, from the gross imposture Psyche turned \nWith horror and disgust her fearful eye; \nHer fate forlorn in silent anguish mourned, \nAnd called her knight with many a hopeless sigh. \nBut see, the crowds in sudden tumult fly! \nThe doors, fast closing to exclude some foe, \nProclaim to Psyche's hopes her hero nigh: \nEscaping from her guard she flies, when lo! \nHis form the bursting gates in awful beauty shew. \n\n'Fly from these dangerous walls,' his page exclaims; \n'Swift let us haste our floating bark to gain! \n'See thy knight's wondrous dart in terror flames; \n'Soon shall these ice-built walls no shape retain! \n'Nor can their Queen his dreaded sight sustain.' \nScarcely she heard while rapidly she fled, \nEven as a bird, escaped the wily train \nThe fowler with destructive art had spread, \nNor panting stays its flight, nor yet foregoes its dread. \n\nSee how astonished now the crowd supine, \nRoused by his potent voice, confused arise; \nIn tottering masses o'er their heads decline \nDissolving walls; they gaze with wild surprise, \nAnd each affrighted from the ruin flies:- \nPitying he views the vain unfeeling band \nBeneath his care, a vile and worthless prize, \nTheir Queen alone his vengeful arms demand, \nBut unknown force was hers his terrors to withstand. \n\nA shield she had of more than Gorgon power, \nAnd whom she would she could transform to stone, \nNor ever had it failed her till that hour: \nShe proves his form invincible alone, \nAnd calls its force petrific on her own. \nAmazed he sees the indurated train, \nThe callous tenants of the silent throne, \nAnd all the marble subjects of their reign, \nInviolably hard, their breathless shape retain. \n\nThe magic shield he thence in triumph bore, \nResolved, in pity to the human race, \nHer noxious hands its might should guide no more, \nAnd bade the seas conceal its Hydra face: \nOh! kindly meant, though much defeated grace! \nFor though the o'erwhelming weight of sounding waves \nConceal its rugged orb a little space, \nSnatched by Glacella from the dark deep caves, \nOnce more the arm of Love with potent spell it braves. \n\nBut Psyche, rescued from their cruel scorn, \nUrges her knight to hasten from the shore: \nThe buoyant vessel on the billows borne \nRides proudly o'er the mounting surge once more; \nAgain they spread the sails, the feathered oar \nSkims with impatient stroke the sparkling tide; \nThe blushing Hymen now their smiles restore \nAgain to frolic gaily at their side, \nThough still their playful taunts reproach their slumbering guide. \n\nPsyche looks back with horror on the coast; \nBlack, drear, and desolate is all the scene: \nThe rocky cliffs still human shape may boast; \nThere the sad victims of the cruel Queen, \nMemorials of her baneful power, are seen: \nNo vine crowned hills, no glowing vales appear, \nNor the white cottage laughs upon the green; \nThe black and leafless thorn alone is there, \nAnd the chill mountains lift their summits wild and bare. \n\nHer spirits lighten as they leave behind \nThe dreary prospect of Glacella's isle; \nShe blest with gladdened heart the light-winged wind \nThat bears her swiftly from a scene so vile; \nWith glistening eye, and hope's prophetic smile, \nShe hears her knight foretel their dangers o'er, \nThat sure success shall crown their fated toil, \nAnd soon arriving at that happy shore, \nLove shall again be found, and leave his bride no more. \n\nNow, from light slumbers and delicious dreams, \nThe jocund cry of joy aroused the fair; \nThe morn that kissed her eyes with golden beams, \nBade her the universal transport share; \nDivinely breathed the aromatic air, \nAnd Psyche's heart, half fainting with delight, \nIn the peculiar odour wafted there \nRecalled the breezes which, o'er scenes most bright, \nTheir wings of perfume shook, and lingering stayed their flight. \n\nThe lovely shore the mariners descry, \nAnd many a gladsome cheer the prospect hails; \nIts graceful hills rise full before the eye, \nWhile eagerly expanding all their sails \nThey woo the freshness of the morning gales: \nThe approaching scenes new opening charms display, \nAnd Psyche's palpitating courage fails, \nShe sees arrived at length the important day, \nUncertain yet of power the mandate to obey. \n\nBut one dear object every wish confines, \nHer spouse is promised in that bower of rest; \nAnd shall the sun, that now so cheerful shines, \nIndeed behold her to his bosom prest, \nAnd in his heavenly smiles of fondness blest? \nOh! \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctis too much!-exhausted life she fears \nWill struggling leave her agitated breast, \nEre to her longing eyes his form appears, \nOr the soft hand of Love shall wipe away her tears. \n\nOh! how impatience gains upon the soul \nWhen the long promised hour of joy draws near! \nHow slow the tardy moments seem to roll! \nWhat spectres rise of inconsistent fear! \nTo the fond doubting heart its hopes appear \nToo brightly fair, too sweet to realize; \nAll seem but day-dreams of delight too dear! \nStrange hopes and fears in painful contest rise, \nWhile the scarce trusted bliss seems but to cheat the eyes. \n\nBut safely anchored in the happy port, \nLed by her knight the golden sands she prest: \nHis heart beat high, his panting breath heaved short, \nAnd sighs proclaim his agitated breast \nBy some important secret thought opprest: \n'At length,' he cries, 'behold the fated spring! \n'Yon rugged cliff conceals the fountain blest, \n'(Dark rocks its crystal source o'ershadowing,) \n'And Constance swift for thee the destined urn shall bring.' \n\nHe speaks, but scarce she hears, her soul intent \nSurveys as in a dream each well known scene: \nNow from the pointed hills her eye she bent \nInquisitive o'er all the sloping green; \nThe graceful temple meet for Beauty's queen, \nThe orange groves that ever blooming glow, \nThe silvery flood, the ambrosial air serene, \nThe matchless trees that fragrant shade bestow, \nAll speak to Psyche's soul, all seem their queen to know. \n\nLet the vain rover, who his youth hath past \nMisled in idle search of happiness, \nDeclare, by late experience taught at last, \nIn all his toils he gained but weariness, \nWooed the coy goddess but to find that less \nShe ever grants where dearest she is bought; \nShe loves the sheltering bowers of home to bless, \nMarks with her peaceful hand the favourite spot, \nAnd smiles to see that Love has home his Psyche brought. \n\nOn the dear earth she kneels the turf to press, \nWith grateful lips and fondly streaming eyes, \n'Are these the unknown bowers of Happiness? \n'Oh! justly called, and gained at last!' she cries, \nAs eagerly to seize the urn she flies. \nBut lo! while yet she gazed with wondering eye \nConstance ascends the steep to gain the prize, \nThe eagle's eyry is not built so high \nAs soon she sees his star bright blazing to the sky. \n\nWith light and nimble foot the boy descends, \nAnd lifts the urn triumphant in his hand; \nLow at the turf-raised altar Psyche bends, \nWhile her fond eyes her promised Love demand; \nClose at her side her faithful guardians stand, \nAs thus with timid voice she pays her vows, \n'Venus, fulfilled is thine adored command, \nThy voice divine the suppliant's claim allows, \n'The smile of favour grant, restore her heavenly spouse.' \n\nScarce on the altar had she placed the urn, \nWhen lo! in whispers to her ravished ear \nSpeaks the soft voice of Love! 'Turn, Psyche, turn! \n'And see at last, released from every fear, \n'Thy spouse, thy faithful knight, thy lover here!' \nFrom his celestial brow the helmet fell, \nIn joy's full glow, unveiled his charms appear, \nBeaming delight and love unspeakable, \nWhile in one rapturous glance their mingling souls they tell. \n\nTwo tapers thus, with pure converging rays, \nIn momentary flash their beams unite, \nShedding but one inseparable blaze \nOf blended radiance and effulgence bright, \nSelf-lost in mutual intermingling light; \nThus, in her lover's circling arms embraced, \nThe fainting Psyche's soul, by sudden flight, \nWith his its subtlest essence interlaced; \nOh! bliss too vast for thought! by words how poorly traced! \n\nFond youth! whom Fate hath summoned to depart, \nAnd quit the object of thy tenderest love, \nHow oft in absence shall thy pensive heart \nCount the sad hours which must in exile move, \nAnd still their irksome weariness reprove; \nDistance with cruel weight but loads thy chain \nWith every step which bids thee farther rove, \nWhile thy reverted eye, with fruitless pain, \nShall seek the trodden path its treasure to regain. \n\nFor thee what rapturous moments are prepared! \nFor thee shall dawn the long expected day! \nAnd he who ne'er thy tender woes hath shared, \nHath never known the transport they shall pay, \nTo wash the memory of those woes away; \nThe bitter tears of absence thou must shed, \nTo know the bliss which tears of joy convey, \nWhen the long hours of sad regret are fled, \nAnd in one dear embrace thy pains compensated! \n\nEven from afar beheld, how eagerly \nWith rapture thou shalt hail the loved abode! \nPerhaps already, with impatient eye, \nFrom the dear casement she hath marked thy road, \nAnd many a sigh for thy return bestowed: \nEven there she meets thy fond enamoured glance: \nThy soul with grateful tenderness o'erflowed, \nWhich firmly bore the hand of hard mischance, \nFaints in the stronger power of joy's o'erwhelming trance. \n\nWith Psyche thou alone canst sympathise, \nThy heart benevolently shares her joy! \nSee her unclose her rapture beaming eyes, \nAnd catch that softly pleasurable sigh, \nThat tells unutterable ecstasy! \nWhile hark melodious numbers through the air, \nOn clouds of fragrance wafted from the sky, \nTheir ravished souls to pious awe prepare, \nAnd lo! the herald doves the Queen of Love declare. \n\nWith fond embrace she clasped her long lost son, \nAnd gracefully received his lovely bride, \n'Psyche! thou hardly hast my favour won!' \nWith roseate smile her heavenly parent cried, \n'Yet hence thy charms immortal, deified, \n'With the young Joys, thy future offspring fair, \n'Shall bloom for ever at thy lover's side; \n'All ruling Jove's high mandate I declare, \n'Blest denizen of Heaven! arise its joys to share.' \n\nShe ceased, and lo! a thousand voices, joined \nIn sweetest chorus, Love's high triumph sing; \nThere, with the Graces and the Hours entwined, \nHis fairy train their rosy garlands bring, \nOr round their mistress sport on halcyon wing; \nWhile she enraptured lives in his dear eye, \nAnd drinks immortal love from that pure spring \nOf never-failing full felicity, \nBathed in ambrosial showers of bliss eternally! \n\nDreams of Delight farewel! your charms no more \nShall gild the hours of solitary gloom! \nThe page remains-but can the page restore \nThe vanished bowers which Fancy taught to bloom? \nAh, no! her smiles no longer can illume \nThe path my Psyche treads no more for me; \nConsigned to dark oblivion's silent tomb \nThe visionary scenes no more I see, \nFast from the fading lines the vivid colours flee!"}
