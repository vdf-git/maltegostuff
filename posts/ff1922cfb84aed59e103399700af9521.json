{"subject": "NIGHTMORNINGSKY", "text": "I'd like to see the tree as it once stood\nbefore me, childhood, the branch and leaf\na single form of transport, ecstasy\nshaking my body I give to the leaves,\nthe leaves return, my stare all interchange.\n\nBut that was when I had a sky to name\nsince I had a belief in constancy\nlike everyone. The sky was my background,\nthe drama of the tree and me, one act,\nthen three, then five, a Shakespearean play script.\nsome tragic flaw in hero, heroine,\nyet to be discovered.\n                             But now the sky\nclouds even dawn with a black mist that falls\nfrom all things and all imaginings.\n\nThe tree in my backyard is caught in this.\nWhen I look for the sky it is still there\nbut now a matter of my memory\nor prophecy.\n                 Where is the root, bough, stem\nset clearly against a morning, clearing?"}
