{"subject": "Black Ink", "text": "The darkness of this night is greater \n   than the power of a sultan. \nInk from my books, shelf upon shelf of them, \n   streams down the curtains. \nEvery book is an overturned inkwell. \nPatience, I say. Day will dawn, \nAnd the colours begin to spread. Snatching the brush, \nI strive to paint the curtains the rose of dawn, \n   and the walls, green. \nNow waves come washing in, blue flecked with white, \n   above the shelves."}
