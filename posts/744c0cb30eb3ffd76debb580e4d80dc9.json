{"subject": "Javanese Dancers", "text": "Twitched strings, the clang of metal, beaten drums, \nDull, shrill, continuous, disquieting: \nAnd now the stealthy dancer comes \nUndulantly with cat-like steps that cling; \n\nSmiling between her painted lids a smile, \nMotionless, unintelligible, she twines \nHer fingers into mazy lines, \nThe scarves across her fingers twine the while. \n\nOne, two, three, four glide forth, and, to and fro, \nDelicately and imperceptibly, \nNow swaying gently in a row, \nNow interthreading slow and rhythmically, \n\nStill, with fixed eyes, monotonously still, \nMysteriously, with smiles inanimate, \nWith lingering feet that undulate, \nWith sinuous fingers, spectral hands that thrill \n\nIn measure while the gnats of music whirr, \nThe little amber-coloured dancers move, \nLike painted idols seen to stir \nBy the idolators in a magic grove."}
