{"subject": "The New Freethinker", "text": "John Grubby who was short and stout \nAnd troubled with religious doubt, \nRefused about the age of three \nTo sit upon the curate's knee; \n(For so the eternal strife must rage \nBetween the spirit of the age \nAnd Dogma, which, as is well known, \nDoes simply hate to be outgrown). \nGrubby, the young idea that shoots, \nOutgrew the ages like old boots; \nWhile still, to all appearance, small, \nWould have no Miracles at all; \nAnd just before the age of ten \nFirmly refused Free Will to men. \nThe altars reeled, the heavens shook, \nJust as he read of in the book; \nFlung from his house went forth the youth \nAlone with tempests and the Truth. \nUp to the distant city and dim \nWhere his papa had bought for him \nA partnership in Chepe and Deer \nWorth, say twelve hundred pounds a year. \nBut he was resolute. Lord Brute \nHad found him useful; and Lord Loot, \nWith whom few other men would act, \nValued his promptitude and tact; \nNever did even philanthrophy \nEnrich a man more rapidly: \n'Twas he that stopped the Strike in Coal, \nFor hungry children racked his soul; \nTo end their misery there and then \nHe filled the mines with Chinamen \nSat in that House that broke the Kings, \nAnd voted for all sorts of things -- \nAnd rose from Under-Sec. to Sec. \nWith scarce a murmur or a check. \nSome grumbled. Growlers who gave less \nThan generous worship to success, \nThe little printers in Dundee, \nWho got ten years for blasphemy, \n(Although he let them off with seven) \nRespect him rather less than heaven. \nNo matter. This can still be said: \nNever to supernatural dread \nNever to unseen deity, \nDid Sir John Grubby bend the knee; \nNor was he bribed by fabled bliss \nTo kneel to any world but this. \nThe curate lives in Camden Town, \nHis lap still empty of renown, \nAnd still across the waste of years \nJohn Grubby, in the House of Peers, \nFaces that curate, proud and free, \nAnd never sits upon his knee."}
