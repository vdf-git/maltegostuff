{"subject": "King Cahill's Farewell To The Rye Field", "text": "WRITTEN TO THE LONDONDERRY AIR\n\n'Tira autumn sun your shadow's flung, my Cahill,\nUpon the field where now your reapmg's done,\nLo, there! And lo! Your reaper's wreath of rushes\nIs on your forehead like a kingly crown.\n\n'And I have come to name you King of Connacht,\nAnd bid you where O'Connor's muster grows:\nNo shadow-king, but one to front the Norman,\nAnd rear the standard that all Eire knows.'\n\n'Farewell,' he said, 'farewell the field I've sickled,\nFarewell the youths whose backs were bent with mine,\nFarewell the maids whose singing now comes to me\n'O Brighid, bless our fields, our roofs, our kine!''\n\n'No Norman keep shall frown above your labors,\nNo pale they'll make to hold our Irish deer;\nA true-born scion of Connacht's kings, I go now:\nThis brand, my father's sword, shall lead your axe,\nyour spear.'"}
