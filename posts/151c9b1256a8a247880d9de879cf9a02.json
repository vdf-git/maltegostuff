{"subject": "Twilight", "text": "Pestilence, disease, and war\nhaunt this sorry place.\nAnd nothing lasts forever;\nthat's a truth we have to face.\n\nWe spend vast energy and time\nplotting death for one another.\nNo one, nowhere, is ever safe.\nNot father, child, or mother.\n\nIs the end of the world a-coming?\nIs that the Devil they hear humming?\nAre those doomsday bells a-ringing?\nIs that the Devil they hear singing?\n\nOr are their dark fears exaggerated?\nAre these doom-criers addlepated?\n\nThose who fear the coming of all Hells\nare those who should be feared themselves\n\nThere's no escape\nFrom death's embrace,\nthough you lead it on\na merry chase.\n\nThe dogs of death\nenjoy the chase.\nJust see the smile\non each hound's face.\n\nThe chase can't last;\nthe dogs must feed.\nIt will come to pass\nWith terrifying speed.\n\nThe hounds, the hounds\ncome baying at his heels.\nThe hounds! The hounds!\nThe breath of death he feels."}
