{"subject": "Earth's Eternity", "text": "Man, Earth's poor shadow! talks of Earth's decay:\nBut hath it nothing of eternal kin?\nNo majesty that shall not pass away?\nNo soul of greatness springing up within?\nThought marks without hoar shadows of sublime,\nPictures of power, which if not doomed to win\nEternity, stand laughing at old Time\nFor ages: in the grand ancestral line\nOf things eternal, mounting to divine,\nI read Magnificence where ages pay\nWorship like conquered foes to the Apennine,\nBecause they could not conquer. There sits Day\nToo high for Night to come at--mountains shine,\nOutpeering Time, too lofty for decay."}
