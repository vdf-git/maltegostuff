{"subject": "The Wind Will Take Us Away", "text": "In my little night, alas\nThe storm has a fateful tryst \nwith the sweet sleep of  the trees.\n\nIn my little night, alas\nThe freezing fright of ruin streams.\n\nListen!\nThe shadows are stepping by\u2026\nWe must flee.\n\nThis bliss seems so odd to me,\nI am addicted to my despair,\nI feel that something will disrupt\nthis flowing peace of our quiet night.\n\n**&amp;**\n\nListen!\nThe shadows are stepping by\u2026\nWe must flee.\n\nDon\u2019t you see?\nOur roof is shaking in fear of collapse,\nand over this roof,  an immense dark cloud,\nlike a dull, grieving crowd,\nis expecting the moment of cry.\n\nDon\u2019t you hear?\nNight is marching behind the window\u2019s glass\nand the wind is cutting our yard\u2019s breath\nIt seems that  stranger eyes\nare watching this house.\n\nListen!\nThe shadows are stepping by\u2026\nWe must flee.\n\n**&amp;**\n\nYou,\nO green like the soul of the leaves,\nPut your hands into mine,\nAnd hold them like the burning memories of love.\n\nYou,\nO green like the soul of the leaves,\nLeave your lips to the stroke of mine,\nAnd savor them like the swell flavor of an old wine.\n\nIf we forget,\nThe wind will take us away,\nThe wind will take us away.\nTranslation: Maryam Dilmaghani, May 2006, October 2006, Montreal."}
