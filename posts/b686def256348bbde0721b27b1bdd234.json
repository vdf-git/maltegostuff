{"subject": "Fingal's Lamen,", "text": "To friends attent, my sad lament, \nI with dool and sorrow roar; \nThese naked walls for pity call, \nAnd grieve my heart full sore. \nMy children too, stand in my view, \nFor help they look on me; \nMy wife, the plague too of my life, \nComforted cannot be. \nFor madness keen, I've blister'd been, \nThey laud'num pour'd in me; \nNor was I spar'd the city-guard, \nAnd bedlam threat'ned me. \nI'm a Highlandman from a martial clan, \nAnd bred to the claymore; \nIn foreign land with heart in hand, \nI've seen my en'mies gore. \nMay ev'ry curse with an empty purse, \nO Cairnton, light on thee: \nMay the Devil teaze and quickly seize \nThyself as thou didst me. \nMay gaugers poind, for their excise, \nThy copper and mash-tun, \nAnd may they come, to thy surprise, \nTo do as thou hast done. \nMay the arrow broad, the curse of God, \nWhich 'stablish'd first excise, \nUpon thy door be fixed sure, \nThere to remain always. \nAnd if for debt, thy final fate, \nThou shalt be e'er opprest; \nMay thou such aid have full repaid, \nLike Fingal be redrest."}
