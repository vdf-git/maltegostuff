{"subject": "Mama's Promise", "text": "I have no answer to the blank inequity\nof a four-year-old dying of cancer.\nI saw her on TV and wept\nwith my mouth full of meatloaf.\n\nI constantly flash on disasters now;\nred lights shout Warning. Danger.\neverywhere I look.\nI buckle him in, but what if a car\nwith a grille like a sharkbite\nroared up out of the road?\nI feed him square meals,\nbut what if the fist of his heart \nshould simply fall open?\nI carried him safely\nas long as I could,\nbut now he's a runaway\non the dangerous highway.\nWarning. Danger.\nI've started to pray.\n\nBut the dangerous highway\ncurves through blue evenings\nwhen I hold his yielding hand\nand snip his minuscule nails\nwith my vicious-looking scissors.\nI carry him around\nlike an egg in a spoon,\nand I remember a porcelain fawn,\na best friend's trust,\nmy broken faith in myself.\nIt's not my grace that keeps me erect\nas the sidewalk clatters downhill\nunder my rollerskate wheels.\n\nSometimes I lie awake\ntroubled by this thought:\nIt's not so simple to give a child birth;\nyou also have to give it death,\nthe jealous fairy's christening gift.\n\nI've always pictured my own death\nas a closed door,\na black room,\na breathless leap from the mountaintop\nwith time to throw out my arms, lift my head,\nand see, in the instant my heart stops,\na whole galaxy of blue.\nI imagined I'd forget,\nin the cessation of feeling,\nwhile the guilt of my lifetime floated away\nlike a nylon nightgown,\nand that I'd fall into clean, fresh forgiveness.\n\nAh, but the death I've given away\nis more mine than the one I've kept:\nfrom my hands the poisoned apple,\nfrom my bow the mistletoe dart.\n\nThen I think of Mama,\nher bountiful breasts.\nWhen I was a child, I really swear,\nMama's kisses could heal.\nI remember her promise,\nand whisper it over my sweet son's sleep:\n\n When you float to the bottom, child,\n like a mote down a sunbeam,\n you'll see me from a trillion miles away:\n my eyes looking up to you,\n my arms outstretched for you like night."}
