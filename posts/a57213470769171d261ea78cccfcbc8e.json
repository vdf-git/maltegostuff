{"subject": "Song (Untitled #10)", "text": "Come to me in any shape! \nAs a victor crown'd with vine, \nIn thy curls the clustering grape, - \nOr a vanquished slave: \n'Tis thy coming that I crave, \nAnd thy folding serpent twine, \nClose and dumb; \nNe'er from that would I escape; \nCome to me in any shape! \nOnly come! \n\nOnly come, and in my breast \nHide thy shame or show thy pride; \nIn my bosom be caressed, \nNever more to part; \nCome into my yearning heart; \nI, the serpent, golden-eyed, \nTwine round thee; \nTwine thee with no venomed test; \nAbsence makes the venomed nest; \nCome to me! \n\nCome to me, my lover, come! \nViolets on the tender stem \nDie and wither in their bloom, \nUnder dewy grass; \nCome, my lover, or, alas! \nI shall die, shall die like them, \nFrail and lone; \nCome to me, my lover, come! \nLet thy bosom be my tomb: \nCome, my own!"}
