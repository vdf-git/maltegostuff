{"subject": "Sonnet Cclxxvi:", "text": "A golden circle for my lady's hand, \nCrowned with a ruby 'twixt the outspread wings \nOf that eternal globe which brooding swings \nOver the mystery or the eldest land. \nSuch is the ring, and thus my fancy planned \nThe fiery jewel, as a sign that brings \nThe fountain whence my glowing passion springs \nEver before her, when her eyes command. \nO winged globe, be present in her mind \nWith the remembrance that the love we pledge \nNot upon earth contented rest can find. \nSoul-like, immortal, on the crumbling edge \nOf time it stands, its venturous plumes to fledge \nFor flights as mystic as the viewless wind."}
