{"subject": "Riddle", "text": "Where far in forest I am laid,\nIn a place ringed around by stones,\nLook for no melancholy shade,\nAnd have no thoughts of buried bones;\nFor I am bodiless and bright,\nAnd fill this glade with sudden glow;\nThe leaves are washed in under-light;\nShade lies upon the boughs like snow."}
