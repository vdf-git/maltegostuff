{"subject": "To A Dead Friend", "text": "It is as if a silver chord\nWere suddenly grown mute,\nAnd life's song with its rhythm warred\nAgainst a silver lute.\n\nIt is as if a silence fell\nWhere bides the garnered sheaf,\nAnd voices murmuring, 'It is well,'\nAre stifled by our grief.\n\nIt is as if the gloom of night\nHad hid a summer's day,\nAnd willows, sighing at their plight,\nBent low beside the way.\n\nFor he was part of all the best\nThat Nature loves and gives,\nAnd ever more on Memory's breast\nHe lies and laughs and lives."}
