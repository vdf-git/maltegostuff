{"subject": "Sarah Cynthia Slyvia Stout Would Not Take The Garbage Out", "text": "Sarah Cynthia Sylvia Stout\nWould not take the garbage out!\nShe'd scour the pots and scrape the pans,\nCandy the yams and spice the hams, \nAnd though her daddy would scream and shout,\nShe simply would not take the garbage out.\nAnd so it piled up to the ceilings:\nCoffee grounds, potato peelings,\nBrown Bananas, rotten peas,\nChunks of sour cottage cheese.\nIt filled the can, it covered the floor, \nIt cracked the window and blocked the door\nWith bacon rinds and chicken bones,\nDrippy ends of ice cream cones,\nPrune pits, peach pits, orange peel,\nGloppy glumps of cold oatmeal,\nPizza crusts and withered greens,\nSoggy beans and tangerines,\nCrusts of black burned buttered toast,\nGrisly bits of beefy roasts...\nThe garbage rolled down the hall,\nIt raised the roof, it broke the wall...\nGreasy napkins, cookie crumbs,\nGlobs of gooey bubble gum,\nCellophane from green baloney,\nRubbery blubbery macaroni,\nPeanut butter, caked and dry,\nCurdled milk and crusts of pie,\nMoldy melons, dried-up mustard,\nEggshells mixed with lemon custard,\nCold french fries and rancid meat,\nYellow lumps of Cream of Wheat.\nAt last the garbage reached so high\nThat finally it touched the sky.\nAnd all the neighbors moved away,\nAnd none of her friends would come to play.\nAnd finally Sarah Cynthia Slylvia Stout said,\n'Ok, I'll take the garbage out!'\nBut then, of course, it was too late...\nThe garbage reached across the state,\nFrom New York to the Golden Gate.\nAnd there, in the garbage she did hate,\nPoor Sarah met an awful fate,\nThat I cannot right now relate\nBecause the hour is much too late.\nBut children, remember Sarah Stout\nAnd always take the garbage out!"}
