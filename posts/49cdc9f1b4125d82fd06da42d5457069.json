{"subject": "Allegiances", "text": "It is time for all the heroes to go home\nif they have any, time for all of us common ones\nto locate ourselves by the real things\nwe live by.\n\nFar to the north, or indeed in any direction,\nstrange mountains and creatures have always lurked-\nelves, goblins, trolls, and spiders:-we\nencounter them in dread and wonder,\n\nBut once we have tasted far streams, touched the gold,\nfound some limit beyond the waterfall,\na season changes, and we come back, changed\nbut safe, quiet, grateful.\n\nSuppose an insane wind holds all the hills\nwhile strange beliefs whine at the traveler's ears,\nwe ordinary beings can cling to the earth and love\nwhere we are, sturdy for common things."}
