{"subject": "Aspens", "text": "All day and night, save winter, every weather,\nAbove the inn, the smithy and the shop, \nThe aspens at the cross-roads talk together\nOf rain, until their last leaves fall from the top.\n\nOut of the blacksmith's cavern comes the ringing\nOf hammer, shoe and anvil; out of the inn\nThe clink, the hum, the roar, the random singing -\nThe sounds that for these fifty years have been. \n\nThe whisper of the aspens is not drowned, \nAnd over lightless pane and footless road, \nEmpty as sky, with every other sound\nNo ceasing, calls their ghosts from their abode,\n\nA silent smithy, a silent inn, nor fails\nIn the bare moonlight or the thick-furred gloom, \nIn the tempest or the night of nightingales, \nTo turn the cross-roads to a ghostly room.\n\nAnd it would be the same were no house near. \nOver all sorts of weather, men, and times, \nAspens must shake their leaves and men may hear\nBut need not listen, more than to my rhymes.\n\nWhatever wind blows, while they and I have leaves\nWe cannot other than an aspen be\nThat ceaselessly, unreasonably grieves, \nOr so men think who like a different tree."}
