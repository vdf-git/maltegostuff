{"subject": "Earlier Poems : Autumn", "text": "With what a glory comes and goes the year!\nThe buds of spring, those beautiful harbingers\nOf sunny skies and cloudless times, enjoy\nLife's newness, and earth's garniture spread out;\nAnd when the silver habit of the clouds\nComes down upon the autumn sun, and with\nA sober gladness the old year takes up\nHis bright inheritance of golden fruits,\nA pomp and pageant fill the splendid scene. \n\nThere is a beautiful spirit breathing now\nIts mellow richness on the clustered trees,\nAnd, from a beaker full of richest dyes,\nPouring new glory on the autumn woods,\nAnd dipping in warm light the pillared clouds.\nMorn on the mountain, like a summer bird,\nLifts up her purple wing, and in the vales\nThe gentle wind, a sweet and passionate wooer,\nKisses the blushing leaf, and stirs up life\nWithin the solemn woods of ash deep-crimsoned,\nAnd silver beech, and maple yellow-leaved,\nWhere Autumn, like a faint old man, sits down\nBy the wayside a-weary. Through the trees\nThe golden robin moves. The purple finch,\nThat on wild cherry and red cedar feeds,\nA winter bird, comes with its plaintive whistle,\nAnd pecks by the witch-hazel, whilst aloud\nFrom cottage roofs the warbling blue-bird sings,\nAnd merrily, with oft-repeated stroke,\nSounds from the threshing-floor the busy flail.\n\nO what a glory doth this world put on\nFor him who, with a fervent heart, goes forth\nUnder the bright and glorious sky, and looks\nOn duties well performed, and days well spent!\nFor him the wind, ay, and the yellow leaves,\nShall have a voice, and give him eloquent teachings.\nHe shall so hear the solemn hymn that Death\nHas lifted up for all, that he shall go\nTo his long resting-place without a tear."}
