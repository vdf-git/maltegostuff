{"subject": "Stop-Time", "text": "At times I've travelled far from you\u2500\nbrought to my knees by want \nin white rooms in distant cities\nand always, music phantoms me\u2500\nfevered, carnal\u2500\nthe rock and roll of my youth,\nthe blues of Clapton and B.B. King, \nthe jazz dark and peeling, \nMiles and Monk and Billie,\nthe straight statements of gospel,\nMahaliah Jackson's every note a prayer\nthat reaches me for brief instants,\nafter dinner at Frederick's and Robert's\nwhere gulls were circling, \nseven settings of the sun sliding into English Bay. \nI stood under the catalpa tree that sang white blossoms onto my hair \nand through my fingers and I was home.\nBlackbirds in the milk-blue light before dawn\nscoring the silence.\nStop-time on the wet embouchure of a trumpet.\nMusic waiting in a white room,\nwhite on white playing on\nin the rabid world, and I your winter queen, your one and only."}
