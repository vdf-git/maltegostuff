{"subject": "The Bean Eaters", "text": "They eat beans mostly, this old yellow pair.\nDinner is a casual affair.\nPlain chipware on a plain and creaking wood, \nTin flatware.\n\nTwo who are Mostly Good.\nTwo who have lived their day,\nBut keep on putting on their clothes\nAnd putting things away.\n\nAnd remembering . . .\nRemembering, with twinklings and twinges,\nAs they lean over the beans in their rented back room that\nis full of beads and receipts and dolls and cloths,\ntobacco crumbs, vases and fringes."}
