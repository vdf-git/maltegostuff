{"subject": "The Folly Of Brown - By A General Agent", "text": "I knew a boor - a clownish card\n(His only friends were pigs and cows and\nThe poultry of a small farmyard),\nWho came into two hundred thousand.\n\nGood fortune worked no change in BROWN,\nThough she's a mighty social chymist;\nHe was a clown - and by a clown\nI do not mean a pantomimist.\n\nIt left him quiet, calm, and cool,\nThough hardly knowing what a crown was -\nYou can't imagine what a fool\nPoor rich uneducated BROWN was!\n\nHe scouted all who wished to come\nAnd give him monetary schooling;\nAnd I propose to give you some\nIdea of his insensate fooling.\n\nI formed a company or two -\n(Of course I don't know what the rest meant,\nI formed them solely with a view\nTo help him to a sound investment).\n\nTheir objects were - their only cares -\nTo justify their Boards in showing\nA handsome dividend on shares\nAnd keep their good promoter going.\n\nBut no - the lout sticks to his brass,\nThough shares at par I freely proffer:\nYet - will it be believed? - the ass\nDeclines, with thanks, my well-meant offer!\n\nHe adds, with bumpkin's stolid grin\n(A weakly intellect denoting),\nHe'd rather not invest it in\nA company of my promoting!\n\n\"You have two hundred 'thou' or more,\"\nSaid I.  \"You'll waste it, lose it, lend it;\nCome, take my furnished second floor,\nI'll gladly show you how to spend it.\"\n\nBut will it be believed that he,\nWith grin upon his face of poppy,\nDeclined my aid, while thanking me\nFor what he called my \"philanthroppy\"?\n\nSome blind, suspicious fools rejoice\nIn doubting friends who wouldn't harm them;\nThey will not hear the charmer's voice,\nHowever wisely he may charm them!\n\nI showed him that his coat, all dust,\nTop boots and cords provoked compassion,\nAnd proved that men of station must\nConform to the decrees of fashion.\n\nI showed him where to buy his hat\nTo coat him, trouser him, and boot him;\nBut no - he wouldn't hear of that -\n\"He didn't think the style would suit him!\"\n\nI offered him a county seat,\nAnd made no end of an oration;\nI made it certainty complete,\nAnd introduced the deputation.\n\nBut no - the clown my prospect blights -\n(The worth of birth it surely teaches!)\n\"Why should I want to spend my nights\nIn Parliament, a-making speeches?\n\n\"I haven't never been to school -\nI ain't had not no eddication -\nAnd I should surely be a fool\nTo publish that to all the nation!\"\n\nI offered him a trotting horse -\nNo hack had ever trotted faster -\nI also offered him, of course,\nA rare and curious \"old master.\"\n\nI offered to procure him weeds -\nWines fit for one in his position -\nBut, though an ass in all his deeds,\nHe'd learnt the meaning of \"commission.\"\n\nHe called me \"thief\" the other day,\nAnd daily from his door he thrusts me;\nMuch more of this, and soon I may\nBegin to think that BROWN mistrusts me.\n\nSo deaf to all sound Reason's rule\nThis poor uneducated clown is,\nYou canNOT fancy what a fool\nPoor rich uneducated BROWN is."}
