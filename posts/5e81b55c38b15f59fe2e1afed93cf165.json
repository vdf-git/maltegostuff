{"subject": "Walking Through The Upper East Side", "text": "All over the district, on leather couches\n&amp; brocade couches, on daybeds\n&amp; 'professional divans,' they are confessing.\nThe air is thick with it,\nthe ears of analysts must be sticky.\n\nWords fill the air above couches &amp; hover there\nhanging like smog. I imagine\nimpossible Steinberg scrolls,\nunutterable sounds suspended in inked curlicues\nwhile the Braque print &amp; the innocuous Utrillo\nlook on look on look on.\n\nMy six analysts for example-\n\nthe sly Czech who tucked his shoelaces\nunder the tongues of his shoes,\nthe mistress of social work with orange hair,\nthe famous old german who said:\n'You sink, zerefore you are,'\nthe bouncy American who loved to talk dirty,\nthe bitchy widow of a famous theoretician,\n&amp; another-or was it two?-I have forgotten-\nthey rise like a Greek chorus in my dreams.\nThey reproach me for my messy life.\nThey do not offer to refund my money.\n\n&amp; the others-siblings for an hour or so-\nghosts whom I brushed in &amp; out of the door.\nSometimes the couch was warm from their bodies.\nOnly our coats knew each other,\nrubbing shoulders in the dark closet."}
