{"subject": "Sleep", "text": "Sleep is no servant of the will,\nIt has caprices of its own:\nWhen most pursued,--'tis swiftly gone;\nWhen courted least, it lingers still.\nWith its vagaries long perplext,\nI turned and turned my restless sconce,\nTill one bright night, I thought at once\nI'd master it; so hear my text!\n\nWhen sleep will tarry, I begin\nMy long and my accustomed prayer;\nAnd in a twinkling sleep is there,\nThrough my bed-curtains peeping in.\nWhen sleep hangs heavy on my eyes,\nI think of debts I fain would pay;\nAnd then, as flies night's shade from day,\nSleep from my heavy eyelids flies.\n\nAnd thus controlled the winged one bends\nEv'n his fantastic will to me;\nAnd, strange, yet true, both I and he\nAre friends,--the very best of friends.\nWe are a happy wedded pair,\nAnd I the lord and she the dame;\nOur bed--our board--our hours the same,\nAnd we're united everywhere.\n\nI'll tell you where I learnt to school\nThis wayward sleep:--a whispered word\nFrom a church-going hag I heard,\nAnd tried it--for I was no fool.\nSo from that very hour I knew\nThat having ready prayers to pray,\nAnd having many debts to pay,\nWill serve for sleep and waking too."}
