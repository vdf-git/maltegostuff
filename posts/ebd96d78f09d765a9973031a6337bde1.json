{"subject": "Buddha In Glory", "text": "Center of all centers, core of cores,\nalmond self-enclosed, and growing sweet--\nall this universe, to the furthest stars\nall beyond them, is your flesh, your fruit.\n\nNow you feel how nothing clings to you;\nyour vast shell reaches into endless space,\nand there the rich, thick fluids rise and flow.\nIlluminated in your infinite peace,\n\na billion stars go spinning through the night,\nblazing high above your head.\nBut in you is the presence that\nwill be, when all the stars are dead."}
