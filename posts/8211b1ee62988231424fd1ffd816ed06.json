{"subject": "The Wingless Archangels", "text": "Beyond the bourn of dreams, their fortunate sphere,\nGolden and large in some rich galaxy,\nRolls upon ways prolonged of harmony;\nAnd they, with wingless toil of many a year,\nUnto the calm of heavens have clomb anear\u2014\nWise with the secrets of eternity,\nAnd forcing truce with time. . . . They deem them free\nFrom change, and from the old, unchanging fear.\n\nBut on their immortality is blight\u2014\nWhose dream betraying deserts have undone:\nThey turn, where winds make chill the ashen light,\nBlown as from space and bleak oblivion;\nAnd mark the dim, portentous breath of Night,\nA mist penumbral on the noontide sun."}
