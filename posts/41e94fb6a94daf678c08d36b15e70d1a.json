{"subject": "Happiness", "text": "I have been taught never to brag but now\nI cannot help it: I keep\na beautiful garden, all abundance,\nindiscriminate, pulling itself\nfrom the stubborn earth: does it offend you\nto watch me working in it,\ntouching my hands to the greening tips or\ntearing the yellow stalks back, so wild\nthe living and the dead both\nsnap off in my hands?\nThe neighbor with his stuttering\nfingers, the neighbor with his broken\nlove: each comes up my drive\nto receive his pitying,\naccustomed consolations, watches me\nwork in silence awhile, rises in anger,\nwalks back. Does it offend them to watch me\nnot mourning with them but working\nfitfully, fruitlessly, working\nthe way the bees work, which is to say\nby instinct alone, which looks like pleasure?\nI can stand for hours among the sweet\nnarcissus, silent as a point of bone.\nI can wait longer than sadness. I can wait longer\nthan your grief. It is such a small thing\nto be proud of, a garden. Today\nthere were scrub jays, quail,\na woodpecker knocking at the white-\nand-black shapes of trees, and someone's lost rabbit\nscratching under the barberry: is it\nindiscriminate? Should it shrink back, wither,\nand expurgate? Should I, too, not be loved?\nIt is only a little time, a little space.\nWhy not watch the grasses take up their colors in a rush\nlike a stream of kerosene being lit?\nIf I could not have made this garden beautiful\nI wouldn't understand your suffering,\nnor care for each the same, inflamed way.\nI would have to stay only like the bees,\nbeyond consciousness, beyond\nself-reproach, fingers dug down hard\ninto stone, and growing nothing.\nThere is no end to ego,\nwith its museum of disappointments.\nI want to take my neighbors into the garden\nand show them: Here is consolation.\nHere is your pity. Look how much seed it drops\naround the sparrows as they fight.\nIt lives alongside their misery.\nIt glows each evening with a violent light."}
