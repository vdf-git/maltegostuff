If I did what I do\nto get by as a fashion statement I'd find that\ndegrading. The correct equation never threatens love.\nThe correct equation in which faith\ncan be substituted without any loss for longing - a language\nin which I could have been so painlessly saved\nwhich you were supposed to invent for me, but didn't -\nI'd find that degrading.\n\nI'm not enclosing hugs, I don't send kisses, I wage\nwar on all fronts. Write back to me asap.\n\nTranslation: Maria Jastrz\u0119bska"}
