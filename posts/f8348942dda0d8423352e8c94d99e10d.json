{"subject": "Music", "text": "Down the quiet eve,\nThro' my window with the sunset\nPipes to me a distant organ\nFoolish ditties;\n\nAnd, as when you change\nPictures in a magic lantern,\nBooks, beds, bottles, floor, and ceiling\nFade and vanish,\n\nAnd I'm well once more . . .\nAugust flares adust and torrid,\nBut my heart is full of April\nSap and sweetness.\n\nIn the quiet eve\nI am loitering, longing, dreaming . . .\nDreaming, and a distant organ\nPipes me ditties.\n\nI can see the shop,\nI can smell the sprinkled pavement,\nWhere she serves-her chestnut chignon\nThrills my senses!\n\nO, the sight and scent,\nWistful eve and perfumed pavement!\nIn the distance pipes an organ . . .\nThe sensation\n\nComes to me anew,\nAnd my spirit for a moment\nThro' the music breathes the blessed\nAirs of London."}
