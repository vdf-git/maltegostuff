{"subject": "Poetry.", "text": "To me the world's an open book\nOf sweet and pleasant poetry;\nI read it in the running brook\nThat sings its way toward the sea.\nIt whispers in the leaves of trees,\nThe swelling grain, the waving grass,\nAnd in the cool, fresh evening breeze\nThat crisps the wavelets as they pass.\n\nThe flowers below, the stars above,\nIn all their bloom and brightness given,\nAre, like the attributes of love,\nThe poetry of earth and heaven.\nThus Nature's volume, read aright,\nAttunes the soul to minstrelsy,\nTinging life's clouds with rosy light,\nAnd all the world with poetry."}
