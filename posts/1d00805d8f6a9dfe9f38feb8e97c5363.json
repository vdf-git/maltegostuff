{"subject": "On The Potomac River U.S.A.", "text": "At close of June's most burning day,\nWe took a ship and sailed away :\nIn mid-Potomac stream sailed we.\nTo Old Point Comfort by the sea.\n\nThe heavy hanging air of dusk\nWas thick with scent of fainting musk.\nAnd through the tired willow trees\nStirred never sound or breath of breeze.\n\nSo still it was, that from afar\nWe seemed to hear a falling star,\nAnd every drop we heard, that dript\nFrom off the paddle as it dipped.\n\nThe fireflies lit their yellow lamps.\nAnd danced along the marshy damps ;\nThey skimmed and shot, and skimmed again.\nWhile beetles droned a dance-refrain.\n\nThe old ship pushed the mists apart,\nAnd crawled along with throbbing heart,\nPausing from time to time for breath\nBeside some jetty, still as death.\n\nThe moon rose up all reddish gold.\nAnd lit the swirhng misty fold\nOf fog along the river bank,\nWhere grew the creepers dark and rank.\n\nSometimes the lonely 'look-out' cried\n'All's well': the water swished and sighed\nAn endless and protesting song,\nAs stealthily we crept along.\n\nUntil at last the wind blew free.\nWhere the Potomac met the sea ;\nAnd not so very far away\nThe shores of Old Point Comfort lay."}
