{"subject": "Roll On Time, Roll On", "text": "Air -- \"Roll on, Silver Moon.\"\nRoll on time, roll on, as it always has done,\nSince the time this world first begun;\nIt can never change my love that I gave a dear man,\nFaithful friend, I gave my heart and hand.\n\nCHORUS:\n\nRoll on time, roll on, it can never turn back\nTo the time of my maiden days -- \nTo the time of my youth it can never turn back\nWhen I wandered with my love, bright and gay.\n\nI was happy then as a girl could ever be,\nAnd live on this earth here below -- \nI was happy as a lark and as busy as a bee,\nFor in fashion or in style I did not go.\n\nMy parents were poor and they could not dress me so,\nFor they had not got the money to spare,\nAnd it may be better so, for I do not think fine clothes\nMake a person any better than they are.\n\nSome people are getting so they think a poor girl,\nThough she be bright and intelligent and gay,\nShe must have nice clothes, or she is nothing in this world,\nIf she is not dressed in style every day.\n\nRemember never to judge people by their clothes,\nFor our brave, noble Washington said,\n\"Honorable are rags, if a true heart they enclose,\"\nAnd I found it was the truth when I married."}
