{"subject": "I Wander In The Month Of May", "text": "Spring sends young fishes to the sea,\nYoung fledglings to the air;\nThe jocund fishes frolic free,\nThe happier fledglings pair.\nI wander in the month of May,\nI see the world a-bloom,\nBut know its garlands overlay\nThe secrets of the tomb.\nFor while the robins build and sing,\nTo me the breath of flowers\nAs captives to the memory bring\nThe ghosts of vanished hours. \nAnd 'mid these forms of dead delight\nTo mine own self I seem\nA phantom wandering in the night,\u2014\nA woman in a dream."}
