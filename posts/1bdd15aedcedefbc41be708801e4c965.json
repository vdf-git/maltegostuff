{"subject": "The End Of The Chapter", "text": "Ah, yes, the chapter ends to-day;\nWe even lay the book away;\nBut oh, how sweet the moments sped\nBefore the final page was read!\n\nWe tried to read between the lines\nThe Author's deep-concealed designs;\nBut scant reward such search secures;\nYou saw my heart and I saw yours.\n\nThe Master,--He who penned the page\nAnd bade us read it,--He is sage:\nAnd what he orders, you and I\nCan but obey, nor question why.\n\nWe read together and forgot\nThe world about us. Time was not.\nUnheeded and unfelt, it fled.\nWe read and hardly knew we read.\n\nUntil beneath a sadder sun,\nWe came to know the book was done.\nThen, as our minds were but new lit,\nIt dawned upon us what was writ;\n\nAnd we were startled. In our eyes,\nLooked forth the light of great surprise.\nThen as a deep-toned tocsin tolls,\nA voice spoke forth: 'Behold your souls!'\n\nI do, I do. I cannot look\nInto your eyes: so close the book.\nBut brought it grief or brought it bliss,\nNo other page shall read like this!"}
