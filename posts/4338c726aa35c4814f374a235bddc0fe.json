{"subject": "Written On A Summer Evening", "text": "The church bells toll a melancholy round,\nCalling the people to some other prayers,\nSome other gloominess, more dreadful cares,\nMore harkening to the sermon's horrid sound.\nSurely the mind of man is closely bound\nIn some blind spell: seeing that each one tears\nHimself from fireside joys and Lydian airs,\nAnd converse high of those with glory crowned.\nStill, still they toll, and I should feel a damp,\nA chill as from a tomb, did I not know\nThat they are dying like an outburnt lamp, - \nThat 'tis their sighing, wailing, ere they go\nInto oblivion -that fresh flowers will grow,\nAnd many glories of immortal stamp."}
