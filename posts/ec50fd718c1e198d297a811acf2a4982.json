{"subject": "Banking Coal", "text": "Whoever it was who brought the first wood and coal\nTo start the Fire, did his part well;\nNot all wood takes to fire from a match,\nNor coal from wood before it\u2019s burned to charcoal.\nThe wood and coal in question caught a flame\nAnd flared up beautifully, touching the air\nThat takes a flame from anything.\n\nSomehow the fire was furnaced,\nAnd then the time was ripe for some to say,\n\u201cRight banking of the furnace saves the coal.\u201d\nI\u2019ve seen them set to work, each in his way,\nThough all with shovels and with ashes,\nNever resting till the fire seemed most dead;\nWhereupon they\u2019d crawl in hooded night-caps\nContentedly to bed. Sometimes the fire left alone\nWould die, but like as not spiced tongues\nRemaining by the hardest on till day would flicker up,\nNever strong, to anyone who cared to rake for them.\nBut roaring fires never have been made that way.\nI\u2019d like to tell those folks that one grand flare\nTransferred to memory tissues of the air\nIs worth a like, or, for dull minds that turn in gold,\nAll money ever saved by banking coal."}
