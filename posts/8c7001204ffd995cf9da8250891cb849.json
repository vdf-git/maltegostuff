{"subject": "Dear Room", "text": "1\n\nAre you still Chinese yellow?\nAre your blinds still drawn\nagainst prying eyes on the tops of buses?\nHow well I remember you,\nperched beside a traffic-light\non the corner of Ladbroke Grove,\nour tree-house lookout post,\nshuddering and shaking all night\nto the jamming of gears,\nthe headlights of cars\nkerb-crawling the platform where we slept.\nYou held us suspended\nhalfway between heaven and earth that year.\nWe climbed up into the fork\nof our lookout tree\nand kicked the ladder away.\n\n2\n\nYou were always more part of the street\nthan part of the house,\nwhich only seemed to exist\nas a doorway, a darkened hall,\nan excited flight of stairs.\nYou were a half-floor,\ntacked to the side of the building\nas an afterthought, an extension of the landing\nsuspended in midair.\nWe tried not to walk too heavily.\n\nRoom, you taught us to live dangerously,\nstriped light coming through the blinds\nand falling on the bed\nwhere we lay too close to the edge.\nLove in that half-world\nwas a seabird's egg, tapered and weighted\nto roll only in that circle\nwhich the ledge allowed was tenable.\nIf one of us lost balance\nwe would tumble into the street.\n\n3\n\nI've heard she keeps you on\nas a studio, somewhere to escape to\nfrom new-found domesticity.\nOnce or twice a week - or is it less? -\nshe'll drop by to water the plants, sulk,\nor do a little work\nsorting through her old stuff for jumble sale.\nI think of her, getting ready to go out,\nmeeting my gaze in the long mirror,\neyes already sheeted for departure.\n\nRoom, you must be wondering\nwhat she is planning to do with you\nnow that everything is stripped bare, made good,\npainted matt magnolia.\nI've been wondering the same thing myself.\nAs she picks up an old blue dress\nand holds it against herself for a moment,\nI almost imagine her\nstaring at me across London,\ndaring me to blink."}
