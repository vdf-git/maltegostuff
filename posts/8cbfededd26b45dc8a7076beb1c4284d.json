{"subject": "Tamer And Hawk", "text": "I thought I was so tough,\nBut gentled at your hands,\nCannot be quick enough\nTo fly for you and show\nThat when I go I go\nAt your commands.\n\nEven in flight above\nI am no longer free:\nYou seeled me with your love,\nI am blind to other birds\u2014\nThe habit of your words\nHas hooded me.\n\nAs formerly, I wheel\nI hover and I twist,\nBut only want the feel,\nIn my possessive thought,\nOf catcher and of caught\nUpon your wrist.\n\nYou but half civilize,\nTaming me in this way.\nThrough having only eyes\nFor you I fear to lose,\nI lose to keep, and choose\nTamer as prey."}
