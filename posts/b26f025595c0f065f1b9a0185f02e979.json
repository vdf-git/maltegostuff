{"subject": "Judging", "text": "Our friends and loved ones that we have lost from this life\n We may meet again someday\n If somewhere along the line\n Some of us don't go astray\n\n We should not be too quick to judge\n The ones that have passed on\n The judging should be lifted up to the man\n That sits upon the throne\n\n He knows all of our strengths and weaknesses\n Also all of our greatest fears\n Some of us he doesn't have to worry much about\n An some of us he has to hold near\n\n Like the shepherd who found he had lost one of his sheep\n AT the end of a long day\n He left the rest of his flock\n To find the one that had gone astray."}
