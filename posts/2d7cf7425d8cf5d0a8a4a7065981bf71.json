{"subject": "For the Old Gnostics", "text": "The Fathers put their trust in the end of the world \nAnd they were wrong.   The Gnostics were right and not \nRight.   Dragons copulate with their knobby tails. \nSome somnolent wealth rises unconcerned, \nOver there!   In the world!   Ponderous stubborn \nSorrow weighs down the flying Gospels. \nSome enormous obstacle blocks our way. \nThe untempered soul grumbles in empty light."}
