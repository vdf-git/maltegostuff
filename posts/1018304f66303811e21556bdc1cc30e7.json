{"subject": "Along The Paths O' Glory", "text": "Along the paths o' glory there are faces new to-day,\nThere are youthful hearts and sturdy that have found the westward way.\nFrom the rugged roads o' duty they have turned without a sigh,\nTo mingle with their brothers who were not afraid to die.\nAnd they're looking back and smiling at the loved ones left behind,\nWith the Old Flag flying o'er them, and they're calling 'Never mind.\n\n'Never mind, oh, gentle mothers, that we shall not come again;\nNever mind the years of absence, never mind the days of pain,\nFor we've found the paths o' glory where the flags o' freedom fly,\nAnd we've learned the things we died for are the truths that never die.\nNow there's never hurt can harm us, and the years will never fade\nThe memory of the soldiers of the legions unafraid.'\n\nAlong the paths o' glory there are faces new to-day,\nAnd the heavenly flags are flying as they march along the way;\nFor the world is safe from hatred; men shall know it at its best\nBy the sacrifice and courage of the boys who go to rest.\nNow they've claimed eternal splendor and they've won eternal youth,\nAnd they've joined the gallant legions of the men who served the truth."}
