{"subject": "The Hive At Gettysburg", "text": "IN the old Hebrew myth the lion's frame,\nSo terrible alive,\nBleached by the desert's sun and wind, became\nThe wandering wild bees' hive;\nAnd he who, lone and naked-handed, tore\nThose jaws of death apart,\nIn after time drew forth their honeyed store\nTo strengthen his strong heart.\nDead seemed the legend: but it only slept\nTo wake beneath our sky;\nJust on the spot whence ravening Treason crept\nBack to its lair to die,\nBleeding and torn from Freedom's mountain bounds,\nA stained and shattered drum\nIs now the hive where, on their flowery rounds,\nThe wild bees go and come.\nUnchallenged by a ghostly sentinel,\nThey wander wide and far,\nAlong green hillsides, sown with shot and shell,\nThrough vales once choked with war.\nThe low reveille of their battle-drum\nDisturbs no morning prayer;\nWith deeper peace in summer noons their hum\nFills all the drowsy air.\nAnd Samson's riddle is our own to-day,\nOf sweetness from the strong,\nOf union, peace, and freedom plucked away\nFrom the rent jaws of wrong.\nFrom Treason's death we draw a purer life,\nAs, from the beast he slew,\nA sweetness sweeter for his bitter strife\nThe old-time athlete drew!"}
