{"subject": "A Mermaid\u2019s Song -", "text": "NOW the dancing sunbeams play\nOn the green and glassy sea;\nCome, and I will lead the way,\nWhere the pearly treasures be.\nCome with me, and we will go\nWhere the rocks of coral grow;\nFollow, follow, follow me.\nCome, behold what treasures lie\nDeep below the rolling waves,\nRiches hid from human eye\nDimly shine in ocean's caves;\nStormy winds are far away,\nEbbing tides brook no delay;\nFollow, follow, follow me."}
