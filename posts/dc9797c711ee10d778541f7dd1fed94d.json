{"subject": "A Hymn To The Moon", "text": "Written in July, in an arbour\nThou silver deity of secret night, \nDirect my footsteps through the woodland shade; \nThou conscious witness of unknown delight, \nThe Lover's guardian, and the Muse's aid! \nBy thy pale beams I solitary rove, \nTo thee my tender grief confide; \nSerenely sweet you gild the silent grove, \nMy friend, my goddess, and my guide. \nE'en thee, fair queen, from thy amazing height, \nThe charms of young Endymion drew; \nVeil'd with the mantle of concealing night; \nWith all thy greatness and thy coldness too."}
