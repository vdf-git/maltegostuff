{"subject": "Stuffed Silence", "text": "Winds define the path now, in order not to submit\nthe discovery of another guilt. \nThe glory stumbles.\nBefore the altar, man becomes a souvenir.\nMechanically you walk like a robot, proud and erect, \ncannot commit suicide.\n\nSecret of discovering a faith was, not to kill yourself.\nShivering in awakened reality, \nyou grope with cauterized vision, \nto resolve the conflict. \nThe revelation does not come. \nUnchained freedom will come late, \nwhen you become the destiny.\n\nEverseeking a revolution, brain will find a false excuse.\nThe archives do not give a clue, \nnot exactly the  circumstances, \nbut history  collected the dirt.\nConcepts could not bring out, \ntransformation of a prejudiced spirit. \nfear and stuffed silence had the answer."}
