{"subject": "Quatrains", "text": "/1/ \n\nI sent you a few words \nones that are now rare - \nif they reach you one day, \nhide them, there's no way to understand me \n/2/ \n\nthe space that exists within a word \nis like our home: \nthere are pictures, sounds, and gestures in it -\nand yet we are forbidden to decipher it \n/3/ \n\nfor those who still believe in words: \nsilent is their surging core, pitch-dark is their heart of fire - \nbut when will we ever understand the sea? \nand the eternal fire? \n/4/ \n\nwhat do we find beyond words: \na flower garden? deep space? \nin the garden, so many things are left unsaid \nin space, so stark is the void \n/5/ \n\nwhat else is left to cling on to? some words \ninsist on bursting through reality's edge - \nupon reaching the other shore, will it still be meaningful, \nto you, everything I want to say? \n/6/ \n\nin every word you read there are always \nmissing letters - \nyou will find them again someday \namidst thickets of memories.\nTranslation: Hasif Amini and Sapardi Djoko Damono"}
