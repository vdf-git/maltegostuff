{"subject": "Two Windows", "text": "1.\nOne looks into the sun lawn, and the steep\nCurved slopes of hills, set sharp against the sky,\nWith tufted woods encinctured, waving high\nO'er vales below, where broken shadows sleep.\nHere, looking forth before the first faint cry\nOf mother-bird, fluttering a drowsy wing\nAbove her brood, awakes the full-voiced choir,\nEre yet the morning tips the hills with fire,\nAnd turns the drapery of the east to gold,\nMy wondering eyes the opening heavens behold,\nWhere far within deep calleth unto deep,\nAnd the whole world stands hushed and worshipping.\nEven thus,--I muse,--shall heaven's gates unfold,\nWhen earth beholds the coming of her King.\n\nII.\n\nThis opens on the sunset, and the sea\nFrom its high casement: never twice the same\nGrand picture rises in its sea-girt frame\nIslets of pearl, and rocks of porphyry\nAnd cliffs of jasper, touched with sunset flame,\nAnd island-trees--that look like Eden's--grow\nPalm-like and slender, in gradations fine,\nThat fade and die along the horizon line,\nAnd the wide heavens become--above--below--\nA luminous sea without a boundary\n\nNay wistful heart,--at day-dawn, or at noon--\nOr midnight watch--the Bridegroom cometh soon;\nBy yonder shining path--or pearly gate;\nThe word is sure,--thou therefore, watch and wait."}
