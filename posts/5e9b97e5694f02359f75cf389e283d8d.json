{"subject": "The Darker Side.", "text": "They say that all nature is smiling and gay,\n  And the birds the most happy of all,\nBut the sparrow, pursued by the sparrowhawk,\n  Savors more of the wormwood and gall.\n\nThey say that all nature is smiling and gay,\n  But the groan may dissemble the laugh;\nE'en now from the meadow is wafted the sound\n  Of a bovine bewailing her calf.\n\nThey say that all nature is smiling and gay,\n  But the moss often covers the rock;\nEvery animal form is beset by a foe,\n  For the wolf always follows the flock.\n\nFor the animal holds all inferior flesh\n  As its just and legitimate prey;\nEvery scream of the eagle a panic creates\n  As the weaker things scamper away.\n\nThey say that all nature is smiling and gay,\n  But the smiles are all needed to sweeten\nThe struggle we see so incessantly waged\n  To eat, and avoid being eaten.\n\nAnd men, with their genial competitive ways\n  Present no decided improvements,\nFor their personal gain they will sacrifice all\n  Who may stand in the way of their movements."}
