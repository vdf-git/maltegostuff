{"subject": "Living Incognito", "text": "I refuse to give in.\nGagged like human sacrifice, \nthe face of defiance\u2015 \nclings onto the dark stains \nof bright moon.\n\nThere was no bond on\ncaressing. The vigil wouldn't \nend after smashing the \nlamps to invoke the darkness.\n\nThere was a day, when \nyou laughed over the spitting \nof rosy wounds. The \npsyche could alter the moods.\n\nWhen you are alone in \nthe dusk, I will pledge a \nfire in night, past human's \nsinged pride.\n\nIn the rose buds, you \ncan find ethereal memories \nof uncommitted sins."}
