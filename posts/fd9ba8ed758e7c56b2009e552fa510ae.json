{"subject": "The Two Painters: A Tale", "text": "Say why in every work of man\nSome imperfection mars the plan?\nWhy join'd in every human art\nA perfect and imperfect part?\nIs it that life for art is short?\nOr is it nature's cruel sport?\nOr would she thus a moral teach;\nThat man should see, but never reach,\nThe height of excellence, and show\nThe vanity of works below?\nOr consequence of Pride, or Sloth;\nOr rather the effect of both?\nWhoe'er on life his eye has cast,\nI fear, alas, will say the last!\n\nOnce on a time in Charon's wherry\nTwo Painters met, on Styx's ferry.\nGood sir, said one, with bow profound,\nI joy to meet thee under ground,\nAnd though with zealous spite we strove\nTo blast each other's fame above,\nYet here, as neither bay nor laurel\nCan tempt us to prolong our quarrel,\nI hope the hand which I extend\nWill meet the welcome of a friend.\nSweet sir! replied the other Shade,\nWhile scorn on either nostril play'd,\nThy proffer'd love were great and kind\nCould I in thee a \nrival\nfind.-\nrival, sir! returned the first,\nReady with rising wind to burst,\nThy meekness, sure, in this I see;\nWe are not rivals, I agree:\nAnd therefore am I more inclin'd\nTo cherish one of humble mind,\nWho apprehends that one above him\nCan never condescend to love him.\n\nNor longer did their courteous guile,\nLike serpent, twisting through a smile,\nEach other sting in civil phrase,\nAnd poison with envenom'd praise;\nFor now the fiend of anger rose,\nDistending each death-withered nose,\nAnd, rolling fierce each glassy eye,\nLike owlets' at the noonday sky,\nSuch flaming vollies pour'd of ire\nAs set old Charon's phlegm on fire.\nPeace! peace! the grizly boatman cried,\nYou drown the roar of Styx's tide;\nUnmanner'd ghosts! if such your strife,\n'Twere better you were still in life!\nIf passions such as these you show\nYou'll make another Earth below;\nWhich, sure, would be a viler birth,\nThan if we made a Hell on Earth.\nAt which in loud defensive strain\n'Gan speak the angry Shades again.\nI'll hear no more, cried he; 'no more'\nIn echoes hoarse return'd the shore.\nTo Minos' court you soon shall hie,\n(Chief Justice here) 'tis he will try\nYour jealous cause, and prove at once\nThat only dunce can hate a dunce.\n\nThus check'd, in sullen mood they sped,\nNor more on either side was said;\nNor aught the dismal silence broke,\nSave only when the boatman's stroke,\nDeep-whizzing through the wave was heard,\nAnd now and then a spectre-bird,\nLow-cow'ring, with a hungry scream.\nFor spectre-fishes in the stream.\n\nNow midway pass'd, the creaking oar\nIs heard upon the fronting shore;\nWhere thronging round in many a band,\nThe curious ghosts beset the strand.\nNow suddenly the boat they 'spy,\nLike gull diminish'd in the sky;\nAnd now, like cloud of dusky white,\nSlow sailing o'er the deep of night,\nThe sheeted group within the bark\nIs seen amid the billows dark.\nAnon the keel with grating sound\nThey hear upon the pebbly ground.\nAnd now with kind, officious hand,\nThey help the ghostly crew to land.\n\nWhat news? they cried with one accord\nI pray you, said a noble lord,\nTell me if in the world above\nI still retain the people's love:\nOr whether they, like us below,\nThe motives of a Patriot know?\nAnd me inform, another said,\nWhat think they of a Buck that's dead?\nHave they discerned that, being dull,\nI knock'd my wit from watchmen's skull?\nAnd me, cried one, of knotty front,\nWith many a scar of pride upon't\nResolve me if the world opine\nPhilosophers are still divine;\nThat having hearts for friends too small,\nOr rather having none at all,\nProfess'd to love, with saving grace,\nThe \nabstract\nof the human race?\nAnd I, exclaim'd a fourth, would ask\nWhat think they of the Critick's task?\nPerceive they now our shallow arts;\nThat merely from the want of parts\nTo write ourselves, we gravely taught\nHow books by others should be wrought?\nWhom interrupting, then inquir'd\nA fifth, in squalid garb attir'd,\nDo now the world with much regard\nIn mem'ry hold the dirty Bard,\nWho credit gain'd for genius rare\nBy shabby coat and uncomb'd hair?\nOr do they, said a Shade of prose,\nWith many a pimple's ghost on nose,\nTh' eccentric author still admire,\nWho wanting that same genius' fire,\nDiving in cellars underground,\nIn pipe the spark ethereal found:\nWhich, fann'd by many a ribbald joke,\nFrom brother tipplers puff'd in smoke,\nSuch blaze diffused with crackling loud,\nAs blinded all the staring croud?\nAnd last, with jealous glancing eye,\nThat seem'd in all around to pry,\nA Painter's ghost in voice suppres'd,\nThus questioning, the group address'd;\n\nSweet strangers, may I too demand,\nHow thrive the offspring of my hand?\nWhether, as when in life I flourish'd,\nThey still by puffs of fame are nourish'd?\nOr whether have the world discern'd\nThe tricks by which my fame was earn'd;\nThat, lacking in my pencil skill,\nI made my tongue its office fill:\nThat, marking (as for love of truth)\nIn others' works a limb uncouth,\nOr face too young, or face too old,\nOr colour hot, or colour cold;\nOr hinting, (if to praise betray'd)\n'Though coloured well, it yet might \nfade\n;'\nAnd 'though its grace I can't deny,\nYet pity 'tis so hard and dry.'-\nI thus by implication show'd\nThat mine were wrought in better mode;\nAnd talking thus superiors down,\nObliquely raise my own renown?\nIn short, I simply this would ask,-\nIf Truth has stript me of the mask;\nAnd, chasing Fashion's mist away,\nExpos'd me to the eye of day-\nA Painter false, without a heart,\nWho lov'd himself, and not his art?\n\nAt which, with fix'd and fishy\nThe Strangers both express'd amaze.\nGood Sir, said they, 'tis strange you dare\nSuch meanness of yourself declare.\n\nWere I on earth, replied the Shade,\nI never had the truth betray'd;\nFor there (and I suspect like you)\nI ne'er had time myself to view.\nYet, knowing that 'bove all creation\nI held myself in estimation,\nI deem'd that what I \nlov'd\nthe \nbest\n\nOf every virtue was possess'd.\nBut \nhere\nin colours black and true,\nMen see themselves, who never knew\nTheir motives in the worldly strife,\nOr real characters through life.\nAnd here, alas! I scarce had been\nA little day, when every sin\nThat slumber'd in my living breast,\nBy Minos rous'd from torpid rest,\nLike thousand adders, rushing out,\nEntwin'd my shuddering limbs about.-\nOh, strangers, hear!-the truth I tell-\nThat fearful sight I saw was Hell.\nAnd, oh I with what unmeasur'd wo\nDid bitterness upon me flow,\nWhen thund'ring through the hissing air,\nI heard the sentence of Despair-\n'Now never hope from Hell to flee;\nYourself is all the Hell you see!'-\n\nHe ceas'd. But still with stubborn pride\nThe Rival Shades each other eyed;\nWhen, bursting with terrifick sound,\nThe voice of Minos shook the ground,\nThe startled ghosts on either side,\nLike clouds before the wind, divide;\nAnd leaving far a passage free,\nEach, conning his defensive plea,\nWith many a crafty lure for grace.\nThe Painters onward hold their pace.\nAnon before the Judgement Seat,\nWith sneer confronting sneer they meet:\nAnd now in deep and awful strain,\nPiercing like fiery darts the brain,\nThus Minos spake. Though I am he,\nFrom whom no secret thought may flee;\nWho sees it ere the birth be known\nTo him, that claims it for his own;\nYet would I still with patience hear\nWhat each may for himself declare,\nThat all in your defence may see\nThe justice pure of my decree.-\nBut, hold!-It ill beseems my place\nTo hear debate in such a case:\nBe therefore thou, Da Vinci's shade,\nWho when on earth to men display'd\nThe scattered powers of human kind\nIn thy capacious soul combin'd;\nBe thou the umpire of the strife,\nAnd judge as thou wert still in life.\n\nThus bid, with grave becoming air,\nTh' appointed judge assum'd the chair.\nAnd now with modest-seeming air,\nThe rivals straight for speech prepare:\nAnd thus, with hand upon his breast,\nThe Senior Ghost the Judge address'd:\nThe world, (if ought the world I durst\nIn this believe) did call me first\nOf those, who by the magick play\nOf harmonizing colours, sway\nThe gazer's sense with such surprise,\nAs make him disbelieve his eyes.\n'Tis true that some of vision dim,\nOr squeamish taste, or pedant whim,\nMy works assail'd with narrow spite;\nAnd, passing o'er my colour bright,\nReproach'd me for my want of grace,\nAnd silks and velvets out of place;\nAnd vulgar form, and lame design,\nAnd want of character; in fine,\nFor lack of worth of every kind\nTo charm or to enlarge the mind.\nNow this, my Lord, as will appear,\nWas nothing less than malice sheer,\nTo stab me, like assassins dark,\nBecause I did not hit a mark,\nAt which (as I have hope of fame)\nI never once design'd to aim.\nFor seeing that the life of man\nWas scarcely longer than a span;\nAnd, knowing that the Graphic Art\nNe'er mortal master'd but \nin part\n;\nI wisely deem'd 'twere labour vain,\nShould I attempt the \nwhole\nto gain;\nAnd therefore, with ambition high,\nAspir'd to reach what pleas'd the eye;\nWhich, truly, sir, must be confess'd,\nA part that far excels the rest:\nFor if, as all the world agree,\n'Twixt Painting and fair Poesy\nThe diff'rence in the mode be found,\nOf colour this, and that of sound,\n'Tis plain, o'er every other grace,\nThat colour holds the highest place;\nAs being that distinctive part,\nWhich bounds it from another art.\nIf therefore, with reproof severe\nI've galled my pigmy Rival here,\n'Twas only, as your Lordship knows,\nBecause his foolish envy chose\nTo rank his classic forms of mud\nAbove my wholesome flesh and blood.\n\nThus ended parle the Senior Shade.\nAnd now, as scorning to upbraid,\nWith curving, \nparabolick\nsmile,\nContemptuous, eying him the while,\nHis Rival thus: 'Twere vain, my Lord,\nTo wound a gnat by spear or sword;\nIf therefore \nI\n, of greater might,\nWould meet this \nthing\nin equal fight,\n'Twere fit that I in size should be\nAs mean, diminutive, as he;\nOf course, disdaining to reply,\nI pass the wretch unheeded by.\nBut since your Lordship deigns to know\nWhat I in my behalf may show,\nWith due submission, I proclaim,\nThat few on earth have borne a name\nMore envied or esteem'd than mine,\nFor grace, expression, and design,\nFor manners true of every clime,\nAnd composition's art sublime.\nIn academick lore profound,\nI boldly took that lofty ground,\nWhich, as it rais'd me near the sky,\nWas thence for vulgar eyes too high;\nOr, if beheld, to them appear'd\nBy clouds of gloomy darkness blear'd.\nYet still that misty height I chose,\nFor well I knew the world had those,\nWhose sight, by learning clear'd of rheum,\nCould pierce with ease the thickest gloom.\nThus, perch'd sublime, 'mid clouds I wrought,\nNor heeded what the vulgar thought.\nWhat, though with clamour coarse and rude\nThey jested on my colours crude;\nComparing with malicious grin,\nMy drapery to bronze and tin,\nMy flesh to brick and earthen ware,\nAnd wire of various kinds my hair;\nOr (if a landscape-bit they saw)\nMy trees to pitchforks crown'd with straw;\nMy clouds to pewter plates of thin edge,\nAnd fields to dish of eggs and spinage;\nYet this, and many a grosser rub,\nLike fam'd Diogenes in tub,\nI bore with philosophic nerve,\nNay, gladly bore; for, here observe,\n\n'Twas that which gave to them offense,\nDid constitute my excellence.\n\nI see, my Lord, at this you stare:\nYet thus I'll prove it to a hair.-\nAs Mind and Body are distinct,\nThough long in social union link'd,\nAnd as the only power they boast,\nIs merely at each other's cost;\nIf both should hold an equal station,\nThey'd both be kings without a nation:\nIf therefore, one would paint the Mind\nIn partnership with Body join'd,\nAnd give to each an equal place,\nWith each an equal truth and grace,\n'Tis clear the picture could not fail\nTo be without or head or tail.\nAnd therefore as the Mind alone\nI chose should fill my graphick throne,\nTo fix her pow'r beyond dispute,\nI trampled Body under foot:\nThat is, in more prosaick dress,\nAs I the passions would express,\nAnd as they ne'er could be portray'd\nWithout the subject Body's aid,\nI show'd no more of that than merely\nSufficed to represent them clearly:\nAs thus-by simple means and pure\nOf light and shadow, and contour:\nBut since what mortals call complexion,\nHas with the mind no more connexion\nThan ethicks with a country dance,\nI left my col'ring all to chance;\nWhich oft (as I may proudly state)\nWith Nature war'd at such a rate,\nAs left no mortal hue or stain\nOf base, corrupting flesh, to chain\nThe Soul to Earth; but, free as light,\nE'en let her soar till out of sight.\n\nThus spake the champion bold of mind;\nAnd thus the Colourist rejoin'd:\nIn truth, my Lord, I apprehend,\nIf I by \nwords\nwith him contend,\nMy case is gone; far he, by gift\nOf what is call'd the \ngab\n, can shift\nThe right for wrong, with such a sleight,\nThat right seems wrong and wrong the right;\nNay, by his twisting logick make\nA square the form of circle take.\nI therefore, with submission meet,\nIn justice do your Grace intreat\nTo let awhile your judgment pause,\nThat \nworks\nnot \nwords\nmay plead our cause.\nLet Merc'ry then to Earth repair,\nThe works of both survey with care,\nAnd hither bring the best of each,\nAnd save us further waste of speech.\n\nSuch fair demand, the Judge replied,\nCould not with justice be denied.\nGood Merc'ry, hence! I fly, my Lord,\nThe Courier said. And, at the word,\nHigh-bounding, wings his airy flight\nSo swift his form eludes the sight;\nNor aught is seen his course to mark,\nSave when athwart the region dark\nHis brazen helm is spied afar,\nBright-trailing like a falling star.\n\nAnd now for minutes ten there stole\nA silence deep o'er every soul-\nWhen, lo! again before them stands\nThe courier's self with empty hands.\nWhy, how is this? exclaim'd the twain;\nWhere are the \npictures\n, sir? Explain!\nGood sirs, replied the God of Post,\nI scarce had reached the other coast,\nWhen Charon told me, one he ferried\nInform'd him they were dead and buried:\nThen bade me hither haste and say,\nTheir ghosts were now upon the way.\nIn mute amaze the Painters stood.\nBut soon upon the Stygian flood,\nBehold! the spectre-pictures float,\nLike rafts behind the towing boat:\nNow reach'd the shore, in close array,\nLike armies drill'd in Homer's day,\nWhen marching on to meet the foe,\nBy bucklers hid from top to toe,\nThey move along the dusky fields,\nA grizly troop of painted shields:\nAnd now, arrived in order fair,\nA gallery huge they hang in air.\n\nThe ghostly croud with gay surprize\nBegan to rub their stony eyes:\nSuch pleasant lounge, they all averr'd,\nNone saw since he had been interr'd;\nAnd thus, like connoisseurs on Earth,\nBegan to weigh the pictures' worth:\nBut first (as deem'd of higher kind)\nExamin'd they the works of \nMind\n.\nPray what is this? demanded one.-\nThat, sir, is Phoebus, alias, Sun:\nA classick work you can't deny;\nThe car and horses in the sky,\nThe clouds on which they hold their way,\nProclaim him all the God of Day.\nNay, learned sir, his dirty plight\nMore fit beseems the God of Night.\nBesides, I cannot well divine\nHow mud like this can ever shine.-\nThen look at that a little higher.-\nI see 'tis Orpheus, by his lyre.\nThe beasts that listening stand around,\nDo well declare the force of sound:\nBut why the fiction thus reverse,\nAnd make the power of song a curse?\nThe ancient Orpheus soften'd rocks,\nYours changes living things to blocks.-\nWell, this you'll sure acknowledge fine,\nParnassus' top with all the Nine.\nAh, \nthere\nis beauty, soul and fire,\nAnd all that human wit inspire!-\nGood sir, you're right; for being stone,\nThey're each to blunted wits a hone.\nAnd what is that? inquir'd another.-\nThat, sir, is Cupid and his Mother.-\nWhat, Venus? sure it cannot be:\nThat skin begrim'd ne'er felt the sea;\nThat Cupid too ne'er knew the sky;\nFor lead, I'm sure, could never fly.-\nI'll hear no more, the Painter said,\nYour souls are, like your bodies, dead!\n\nWith secret triumph now elate,\nHis grinning Rival 'gan to prate.\nOh, fie! my friends; upon my word,\nYou're too severe: he should be \nheard\n;\nFor \nMind\ncan ne'er to glory reach,\nWithout the usual aid of \nspeech\n.\nIf thus howe'er, you seal his doom,\nWhat hope have I unknown to Rome?\nBut since the \ntruth\nbe your dominion,\nI beg to hear your just opinion.\nThis picture then-which some have thought\nBy far the best I ever wrought-\nObserve it well with critick ken;\n'Tis Daniel in the Lion's Den.-\n'Tis flesh itself! exclaim'd a Critick.\nBut why make Daniel paralytick?\nHis limbs and features are distorted.\nAnd then his legs are badly sorted.\n'Tis true, a miracle you've hit,\nBut not as told in Holy Writ;\nFor there the miracle was braving,\nWith \nbones unbroke\n, the Lion's craving;\nBut yours (what ne'er could man befall)\nThat he should \nlive with none at all\n.-\nAnd pray, inquir'd another spectre,\nWhat Mufti's that at pious lecture?\nThat's Socrates, condemned to die;\nHe next, in sable, standing by,\nIs Galen, come to save his friend,\nIf possible, from such an end;\nThe other figures, group'd around,\nHis Scholars, wrapt in woe profound.-\nAnd am I like to this portray'd?\nExclaim'd the Sage's smiling Shade.\nGood Sir, I never knew before\nThat I a Turkish turban wore,\nOr mantle hemm'd with golden stitches,\nMuch less a pair of satin breeches;\nBut as for him in sable clad,\nThough wond'rous kind, 'twas rather mad\nTo visit one like me forlorn,\nSo long before himself was born.\nAnd what's the next? inquir'd a third;\nA jolly blade upon my word!-\n'Tis Alexander, Philip's son,\nLamenting o'er his battles won;\nThat now his mighty toils are o'er,\nThe world has nought to conquer more.\nAt which, forth stalking from the host,\nBefore them stood the Hero's Ghost-\nWas that, said he, my earthly form,\nThe Genius of the battle-storm?\nFrom top to toe the figure's Dutch!\nAlas, my friend, had I been such,\nHad I that fat and meaty skull,\nThose bloated cheeks, and eyes so dull,\nThat driv'ling mouth, and bottle nose,\nThose shambling legs, and gouty toes;\nThus form'd to snore throughout the day,-\nAnd eat and drink the night away;\nI ne'er had felt the fev'rish flame\nThat caus'd my bloody thirst for fame;\nNor madly claim'd immortal birth,\nBecause the vilest brute on Earth:\nAnd, oh! I'd not been doom'd to hear,\nStill whizzing in my blister'd ear,\nThe curses deep, in damning peals,\nThat rose from 'neath my chariot wheels,\nWhen I along the embattled plain\nWith furious triumph crush'd the slain:\nI should not thus be doom'd to see,\nIn every shape of agony,\nThe victims of my cruel wrath,\nFor ever dying, strew my path;\nThe grinding teeth, the lips awry,\nThe inflated nose, the starting eye,\nThe mangled bodies writhing round,\nLike serpents, on the bloody ground;\nI should not thus for ever seem\nA charnel house, and scent the steam\nOf black, fermenting, putrid gore,\nRank oozing through each burning pore;\nBehold, as on a dungeon wall,\nThe worms upon my body crawl,\nThe which, if I would brush away,\nAround my clammy fingers play,\nAnd, twining fast with many a coil,\nIn loathsome sport my labor foil.\n\nEnough! the frighted Painter cried,\nAnd hung his head in fallen pride.\n\nNot so the other. He, of stuff\nMore stubborn, ne'er would cry enough;\nBut like a soundly cudgell'd oak,\nMore sturdy grew at every stroke,\nAnd thus again his ready tongue\nWith fluent logick would have rung:\nMy Lord, I'll prove, or I'm a liar-\nWhom interrupting then with ire,\nThus check'd the Judge: Oh, proud yet mean!\nAnd canst thou hope from me to screen\nThy foolish heart, and o'er it spread\nA veil to cheat th' omniscient dead?\nAnd canst thou hope, as once on Earth,\nApplause to gain by specious worth;\nLike those that still by sneer and taunt\nWould prove pernicious what they want;\nAnd claim the mastership of Art,\nBecause thou only know'st a \npart\n?\n\nHad'st thou from Nature, not the Schools\nDistorted by pedantic rules,\nWith patience wrought, such logic vain\nHad ne'er perverted thus thy brain:\nFor Genius never gave delight\nBy means of what offends the sight:\nNor hadst thou deem'd, with folly mad,\nThou could'st to Nature's beauties \nadd\n,\nBy \ntaking from her that which gives\nThe best assurance that she lives;\nBy imperfection give attraction,\nAnd multiply them by subtraction.\nDid Raffaelle thus, whose honour'd ghost\nIs now Elysium's fairest boast?\nFar diff'rent He. Though weak and lame\nIn parts that gave to others fame,\nYet sought not \nhe\nby such defect\nTo swindle praise for \nwise neglect\n\nOf \nvulgar\ncharms, that only \nblind\n\nThe dazzled eye to those of Mind.\nBy Heaven impressed with Genius' seal,\nAn eye to see, and heart to feel,\nHis soul through boundless Nature rov'd,\nAnd seeing felt, and feeling lov'd.\nBut weak the power of mind at will\nTo give the hand the painter's skill;\nFor mortal works, maturing slow,\nFrom patient care and labour flow:\nAnd hence restrain'd, his youthful hand\nObey'd a master's dull command;\nBut soon with health his sickly style\nFrom Leonardo learn'd to smile;\nAnd now from Bonarroti caught\nA nobler Form; and now it sought\nOf colour fair the magic spell,\nAnd trac'd her to the Friar's cell.\nNo foolish pride, no narrow rule\nEnslav'd his soul; from every School,\nWhatever fair, whatever grand,\nHis pencil, like a potent wand,\nTransfusing, bade his canvass grace.\nProgressive thus, with giant pace.\nAnd energy no toil could tame,\nHe climb'd the rugged mount of Fame:\nAnd soon had reach'd the summit bold,\nWhen Death, who there delights to hold\nHis fatal watch, with envious blow\nQuick hurl'd him to the shades below.\n\nThus check'd the Judge the champion vain\nOf \nClassic Form\n; and thus in strain,\nBy anger half and pity mov'd,\nThe ghostly Colourist reprov'd.\nAnd what didst \nThou\naspire to gain,\n\nWho\ndar'd'st the will of Jove arraign,\nThat bounded thus within a span\nThe little life of little man;\nWith shallow art deriving thence\nExcuses for thy indolence?\n'Tis cant and hypocritic stuff!\nThe life of man is long enough:\nFor did he but the half improve\nHe would not quarrel thus with Jove.\n\nBut most I marvel (if it be\nThat aught may wond'rous seem to me)\nThat Jove's high Gift, your noble Art,\nBestow'd to raise Man's grov'ling heart,\nRefining with ethereal ray\nEach gross and selfish thought away,\nShould pander turn of paltry pelf,\nImprisoning each within himself;\nOr like a gorgeous serpent, be\nYour splendid source of misery,\nAnd, crushing with his burnish'd folds,\nStill narrower make your narrow souls.\n\nBut words can ne'er reform produce,\nIn Ignorance and Pride obtuse.\nThen know, ye rain and foolish Pair!\nYour doom is fix'd a yoke to bear\nLike beasts on Earth; and, thus in tether,\nFive Centuries to paint together.\nIf, thus by mutual labours join'd,\nYour jarring souls should be combin'd,\nThe faults of each the other mending,\nThe powers of both harmonious blending;\nGreat Jove, perhaps, in gracious vein,\nMay send your souls on Earth again;\nYet there One only Painter be;\nFor thus the eternal Fates decree:\nOne Leg alone shall never run,\nNor two Half-Painters make but One."}
