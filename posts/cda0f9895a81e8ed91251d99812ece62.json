The lesser flamingoes\nwere going to shed the pink color.\n\nNude as a python, the kiss\nof pomegranates, kills by asphyxiation.\nI suffer in the hands of protests.\nThe black ice now enters the eye of a needle.\n\nA barefoot noun feeds the junta.\nThe butter babies will serve the poetry \nof poor on the mats of principles.\nI will remain unslept on straw.\n\nA newspaper eats the story this side.\nAfter the bloodbath surgeons weep.\nAn armless lover hugs a priest \nfor not calling the gods."}
