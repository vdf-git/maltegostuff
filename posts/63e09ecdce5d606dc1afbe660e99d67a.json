{"subject": "Youth", "text": "A whip cracks in the wood, and cattle low\nAnd through the underbrush are heard to\nCrash heavily. Leaves rustle. Snowdrops show\nTheir blue heads here and there. A sudden, furtive\n\nWind starts to blow, and ashen clouds are swept\nAcross the skies, a cool, fresh rain presaging\u2026\nThe heart grieves and is glad that life is, strangely,\nVast like the steppe and empty like the steppe."}
