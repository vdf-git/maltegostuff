{"subject": "VERSE COMES FROM THE NIGHT", "text": "In the city of mist the feast\nOf nights is a wood\nOf dark heads of hair and stars. \n\nDisturbing me with its pale fingers of dew\nLike lovers' surprising words, \nIts silence maddens the solitary plazas, \nThe streets, the silent spaces\nThrough which the mysterious, eternal air, passes.\n\nIt is the murmur, the winds\nLikeat nightfall the shadow\nof a head of hair between hands. \nIt is the murmur drifting in the wind, \nIn the lugubrious wind\nWhere lights and mirrors\nOf the nocturnal city whimper.\n\nIt is the murmur, the syllables \nThat are born and bring a song\nTo the heart that dreams, \nA song, the syllables\nGrowing amidst the fog\nOr like a naked flower under the rain\n(We have never loved so much, no one\nCan ever say we have loved so much\nIn one night. \nIn our hearts horizons resound\nAnd the vicinity of the earth also resounds.)\n\nSilent verse was in the night,\nClear verse was the instinct\nUnder rough bark or bitter skin.\nVerse, words girdle the slender\nBodies of the women, \nTheir bodies clear in the moonlight\nSuspended in music, \nSyllables girdled the bodies\nLike ardent voices, like flames.\n\nIt is a tree of rain that moans in the wind\nIts songs,\nThe blood rises like a river softly sobbing\nAnd I endure the inflamed sadness of a cry\nSpread out in the middle of the night.\n\nOf the thirsty night, the innumerable night,\nOf the night that keeps \nDesires like shadows, \nOf the painful, mute, beloved songs,\nShadows of desires, \nShadows of an old, bitter silence. \nBitter, yes, drifting silence in which nothing is left\nBut the poem of the night\nAs a remembrance wounded by the edge of a kiss."}
