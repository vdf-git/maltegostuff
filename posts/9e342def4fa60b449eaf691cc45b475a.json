{"subject": "Sierra Kid", "text": "\"I've been where it hurts.\" the Kid \n\nHe becomes Sierra Kid\n\n        I passed Slimgullion, Morgan Mine, \n        Camp Seco, and the rotting Lode. \n             Dark walls of sugar pine --, \n             And where I left the road \n\n             I left myself behind; \n             Talked to no one, thought \n        Of nothing. When my luck ran out \n        Lived on berries, nuts, bleached grass. \n             Driven by the wind \n             Through great Sonora pass, \n\n             I found an Indian's teeth; \n             Turned and climbed again \n        Without direction, compass, path, \n        Without a way of coming down, \n             Until I stopped somewhere \n             And gave the place a name. \n\n             I called the forests mine; \n             Whatever I could hear \n        I took to be a voice: a man \n        Was something I would never hear.\n\nHe faces his second winter in the Sierra\n\n        A hard brown bug, maybe a beetle, \n        Packing a ball of sparrow shit -- \n             What shall I call it? \n        Shit beetle? Why's it pushing here \n        At this great height in the thin air \n             With its ridiculous waddle \n\n        Up the hard side of Hard Luck Hill? \n        And the furred thing that frightened me -- \n             Bobcat, coyote, wild dog -- \n        Flat eyes in winter bush, stiff tail \n        Holding his ground, a rotted log. \n             Grass snakes that wouldn't die, \n\n        And night hawks hanging on the rim \n        Of what was mine. I know them now; \n             They have absorbed a mind \n        Which must endure the freezing snow \n        They endure and, freezing, find \n             A clear sustaining stream.\n\nHe learns to lose\n\n             She was afraid \n             Of everything, \n        The little Digger girl. \n             Pah Utes had killed \n             Her older brother \n        Who may have been her lover \n             The way she cried \n             Over his ring -- \n\n             The heavy brass \n             On the heavy hand. \n        She carried it for weeks \n             Clenched in her fist \n             As if it might \n        Keep out the loneliness \n             Or the plain fact \n             That he was gone. \n\n             When the first snows \n             Began to fall \n        She stopped her crying, picked \n             Berries, sweet grass, \n             Mended her clothes \n        And sewed a patchwork shawl. \n             We slept together \n             But did not speak. \n\n             It may have been \n             The Pah Utes took \n        Her off, perhaps her kin. \n             I came back \n             To find her gone \n        With half the winter left \n             To face alone -- \n             The slow grey dark \n\n             Moving along \n             The dark tipped grass \n        Between the numbed pines. \n             Night after night \n             For four long months \n        My face to her dark face \n             We two had lain \n             Till the first light.\n\nCivilization comes to Sierra Kid\n\n             They levelled Tater Hill \n                 And I was sick. \n        First sun, and the chain saws \n             Coming on; blue haze, \n                 Dull blue exhaust \n        Rising, dust rising, and the smell. \n\n             Moving from their thatched huts \n                 The crazed wood rats \n        By the thousand; grouse, spotted quail \n             Abandoning the hills \n                 For the sparse trail \n        On which, exposed, I also packed. \n\n             Six weeks. I went back down \n                 Through my own woods \n        Afraid of what I knew they'd done. \n             There, there, an A&amp;P, \n                 And not a tree \n        For Miles, and mammoth hills of goods. \n\n             Fat men in uniforms, \n                 Young men in aprons \n        With one face shouting, \"He is mad!\" \n             I answered: \"I am Lincoln, \n                 Aaron Burr, \n        The aging son of Appleseed. \n\n             \"I am American \n                 And I am cold.\" \n        But not a one would hear me out. \n             Oh God, what have I seen \n                 That was not sold! \n        They shot an old man in the gut.\n\nMad, dying, Sierra Kid enters the capital\n\n                 What have I changed? \n        I unwound burdocks from my hair \n                 And scalded stains \n                 Of the black grape \n        And hid beneath long underwear \n                 The yellowed tape. \n\n                 Who will they find \n        In the dark woods of the dark mind \n                 Now I have gone \n                 Into the world? \n        Across the blazing civic lawn \n                 A shadow's hurled \n\n                 And I must follow. \n        Something slides beneath my vest \n                 Like melted tallow, \n                 Thick but thin, \n        Burning where it comes to rest \n                 On what was skin. \n\n                 Who will they find? \n        A man with no eyes in his head? \n                 Or just a mind \n                 Calm and alone? \n        Or just a mouth, silent, dead, \n                 The lips half gone? \n\n                 Will they presume \n        That someone once was half alive \n                 And that the air \n                 Was massive where \n        The sickening pyracanthus thrive \n                 Staining his tomb? \n\n                 I came to touch \n        The great heart of a dying state. \n                 Here is the wound! \n                 It makes no sound. \n        All that we learn we learn too late, \n                 And it's not much."}
