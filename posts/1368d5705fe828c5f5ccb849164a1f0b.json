{"subject": "Flowers and Weeds", "text": "This fragile hothouse plant of mine\nIn perfect bloom,\nThis flower whose varied tints combine\nThe costliest jewel to outshine,\nThis native of some tropic clime,\nThis princess of a royal line,\nAh! would she own\nThat low, coarse weed by yonder fence,\nA cousin to her excellence?\n\nAnd yet the truth must needs proclaim,\nWith Fate's stern pen;\nThe weed, a thing of blight and blame,\nBears in its coarse low life the same\nRemote and honored family name,\nAs this, my pet of floral fame;\nWith flowers and men\nThe ties of nature sometimes bind\nTo rudest natures left behind.\n\nThe honored, virtuous life must blush\nOfttimes in vain,\nFor kindred lives whose baseness crush\nThe buds of promise in their flush,\nAnd make their names a funeral hush,\nAnd pure affection's fountains gush,\nTo bear a stain;\nCondemn not truth for error's deeds,\nWhile flowers are flowers and weeds are weeds."}
