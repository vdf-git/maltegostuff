{"subject": "Little Nell's Funeral", "text": "And now the bell, - the bell \nShe had so often heard by night and day \nAnd listened to with solemn pleasure, \nE'en as a living voice, - \nRung its remorseless toll for her, \nSo young, so beautiful, so good. \n\nDecrepit age, and vigorous life, \nAnd blooming youth, and helpless infancy, \nPoured forth, - on crutches, in the pride of strength \nAnd health, in the full blush \nOf promise, the mere dawn of life, - \nTo gather round her tomb. Old men were there, \nWhose eyes were dim \nAnd senses failing, - \nGrandames, who might have died ten years ago, \nAnd still been old, - the deaf, the blind, the lame, \nThe palsied, \nThe living dead in many shapes and forms, \nTo see the closing of this early grave. \nWhat was the death it would shut in, \nTo that which still could crawl and keep above it! \n\nAlong the crowded path they bore her now; \nPure as the new fallen snow \nThat covered it; whose day on earth \nHad been as fleeting. \nUnder that porch, where she had sat when Heaven \nIn mercy brought her to that peaceful spot, \nShe passed again, and the old church \nReceived her in its quiet shade. \n\nThey carried her to one old nook, \nWhere she had many and many a time sat musing, \nAnd laid their burden softly on the pavement. \nThe light streamed on it through \nThe colored window, - a window where the boughs \nOf trees were ever rustling \nIn the summer, and where the birds \nSang sweetly all day long."}
