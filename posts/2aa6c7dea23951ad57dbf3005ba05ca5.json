{"subject": "Sonnet Lii. To The Yellow Cistus.", "text": "Flower, that with thy silken tapestry\nOf flexile petals interwove with green,\nClothest the mountain walls of this calm scene;\nWe, a love--led poetic company,\nPronounce thee happy; if happiness it be\nIn every cleft the bright gray rocks between\nTo plant thy seemly gems, and reign the queen\nOf path--side blossoms over wood and lea.\nLive, and of those poor fools who idly moan\nThy fragile lifetime's shortness, reck not aught;\nThou diest not, when thy ripe blossoms are strown\nOn the damp earth, or by the tempest caught;\nThou hast a future life to them unknown,\nIn the eternity of human thought."}
