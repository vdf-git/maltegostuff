{"subject": "Birds, Converging", "text": "Sun salved, we sit on the front porch, careful\nwhen we speak, watching the crows swagger near\nthe property line, dabbing - what. A nest\nof grubs? Ice-wintered berries? New grass shoots?\nSuch purposeful pecking. They pause, sky-tipped.\nResume their work. Curious, we step close -\na starling twitches at their feet. One eye\ngone, the other blinking fast, rib cage open\nto the sun as the snow unravels from\nour roof, soaking the lawn. Your arm touches mine\nand all the words we had this morning fall\naway like the empty husks piled under the feeder,\nseeds cracked open by the birds, converging."}
