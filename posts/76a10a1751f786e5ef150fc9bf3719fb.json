{"subject": "A Letter", "text": "Dear philosophers, I get sad when I think.\nIs it the same with you?\nJust as I'm about to sink my teeth into the noumenon,\nSome old girlfriend comes to distract me.\n\u00bbShe's not even alive!\u00ab I yell to heaven.\n\nThe wintry light made me go out of my way.\nI saw beds covered with identical gray blankets.\nI saw grim-looking men holding a naked woman\nWhile they hosed her with cold water.\nWas that to calm her nerves, or was it punishment?\n\nI went to visit my friend Bob who said to me:\n\u00bbWe reach the real by overcoming the seduction\n     of images.\u00ab\nI was overjoyed, until I realized\nSuch abstinence will never be possible for me.\nI caught myself looking out the window.\n\nBob's father was taking their dog for a walk.\nHe moved with pain; the dog waited for him.\nThere was no one else in the park,\nOnly bare trees with an infinity of tragic shapes\nTo make thinking difficult."}
