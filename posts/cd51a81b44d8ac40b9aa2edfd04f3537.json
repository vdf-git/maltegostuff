{"subject": "Jes' Wonderin'!", "text": "I WONDER if they're bitin' way off yonder in the bay! \nI wonder if they're fightin' very hard t' git away! \nI wonder if they're hungry, an' would grab a silver spoon\nTh' way that I remember they used t' do in June! \nI wonder if Ole Daddy's caught his big one yet this year;\nAn' I guess the boss is wonderin' why I'm sittin' idle here.\n\nI wonder if the lily pads are just as thick t'day \nAs what they were in by-gone times when I was on the bay!\nI wonder if my favorite spot right now is occupied \nBy some one else, an' if it's come t' be a stranger's pride; \nAn' if he knows its secrets, too, an' holds 'em just as dear, \nAn' if the boss is wonderin' why I'm sittin' wonderin' here.\n\nI wonder if the gulls fly 'round the way they used t' do, \nT' grab the minnows now an' then that in the bay I threw!\nI wonder if I still could cast as true as what I did \nWhen I could land it every time where some big one was hid!\nAn' O, I wonder if the day will ever come again \nWhen I shall hear a singing reel, the way I heard it then."}
