{"subject": "Atavism", "text": "O beauteous daughter of a mighty race! \nIn thy fair features and thy radiant eyes \nLike bright clouds floating over brighter skies \nThe shadows of a glorious past we trace. \nFramed in the oval of thy perfect face \nFlit the pale belles of bygone centuries; \nA hint of lawgivers and jurists lies \nIn that pure brow where strength is wed with grace. \nAnd looking on thy profile's symmetry \nA world-famed face across my memory comes, \n'Neath the slouched hat a watching eagle's eye, \nWhere down the dusty line goes riding by, \nWith blare of trumpets and hoarse growl of drums, \nTecumseh Sherman marching to the sea."}
