{"subject": "The Second Hymn For Advent; Or Christ's Coming To Jerusalem In Triumph", "text": "Lord come away, \nWhy dost Thou stay? \nThy rode is ready; and Thy paths, made strait, \nWith longing expectation, wait \nThe consecration of Thy beauteous feet. \nRide on triumphantly; behold we lay \nOur lusts and proud wills in Thy way. \nHosanna! welcome to our hearts! Lord, here \nThou hast a temple too, and full as dear \nAs that of Sion, and as full of sin: \nNothing but thieves and robbers dwel therein, \nEnter, and chase them forth, and cleanse the floore; \nCrucifie them, that they may never more \nProfane that holy place \nWhere Thou hast chose to set Thy face. \nAnd then if our stiff tongues shall be \nMute in the praises of Thy Deity; \nThe stones out of the Temple-wall \nShall cry aloud and call \nHosanna! and Thy glorious footsteps greet. \nAmen."}
