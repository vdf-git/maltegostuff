{"subject": "Moon-Magician-Manacle-Mother, Or Harry Houdini Rising", "text": "The Man in the Moon flaunts\nhis freedom in his mostly intact tux: the bell\nmoon, a weight that cannot hold him,\nthe tightrope, a chain that also\ndoes not bind. An audience watches\nas always wild with applause at his brave\nfeats while he extracts black\nsilhouette women from the cage\nof his mouth, how many caught like keys\nunder his glib tongue,\nbehind the bars of his teeth a mystery. They\nhang clipped to his rope like clothes in the wind\nwhile they contemplate,\ndangling, their own no-less daunting\nescape. Make no mistake. They are the white\nmoon's dark eyes. Look at their hands\nwhich hold the pen, the brush, the magic\nwand sticks. When they bring their\nsisters to safety, they will drop, fly,\nleap from his line. Write their\nown history. Title themselves.\nIt's not the (so-called)  Magician\nwho interests me, but the mother,\nthe wife, who taught moon &amp; manacle,\nkey keeping, sharp-edged juggling. Stage\nmangaged her tail off. Sewed his shorts.\nThink how many of them tip-toed\naround to get one show off."}
