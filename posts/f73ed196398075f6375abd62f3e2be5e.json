{"subject": "Paderewski", "text": "IF songs were perfume, color, wild desire; \nIf poet's words were fire \nThat burned to blood in purple-pulsing veins; \nIf with a bird-like thrill the moments throbbed to hours; \nIf summer's rains \nTurned drop by drop to shy, sweet, maiden flowers; \nIf God made flowers with light and music in them, \nAnd saddened hearts could win them; \nIf loosened petals touched the ground \nWith a caressing sound; \nIf love's eyes uttered word \nNo listening lover e'er before had heard; \nIf silent thoughts spake with a bugle's voice; \nIf flame passed into song and cried, 'Rejoice! Rejoice!' \nIf words could picture life's, hope's, heaven's eclipse \nWhen the last kiss has fallen on dying eyes and lips; \nIf all of mortal woe \nStruck on one heart with breathless blow on blow; \nIf melody were tears, and tears were starry gleams \nThat shone in evening's amethystine dreams; \nAh, yes, if notes were stars, each star a different hue, \nTrembling to earth in dew; \nOr if the boreal pulsings, rose and white, \nMade a majestic music in the night; \nIf all the orbs lost in the light of day \nIn the deep, silent blue began their harps to play; \nAnd when in frightening skies the lightnings flashed \nAnd storm-clouds crashed, \nIf every stroke of light and sound were but excess of beauty; \nIf human syllables could quick refashion \nThat fierce electric passion; \nIf other art could match (as were the poet's duty) \nThe grieving, and the rapture, and the thunder \nOf that keen hour of wonder, \u2014 \nThat light as if of heaven, that blackness as of hell, \u2014 \nHow the great master played then might I dare to tell. \nII \nHow the great master played! And was it he \nOr some disbodied spirit which had rushed \nFrom silence into singing; and had crushed \nInto one startled hour a life's felicity, \nAnd highest bliss of knowledge \u2014that all life, grief, wrong, \nTurn at the last to beauty and to song!"}
