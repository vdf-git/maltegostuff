{"subject": "Censor Literarum", "text": "So, Parson Stebbins, you've released your chin\nTo say that here, and here, we press-folk ail.\n'Tis a great thing an editor to skin\nAnd hang his faulty pelt upon a nail\n(If over-eared, it has, at least, no tail)\nAnd, for an admonition against sin,\nPoint out its maculations with a rod,\nAnd act, in short, the gentleman of God.\n\n'Twere needless cruelty to spoil your sport\nBy comment, critical or merely rude;\nBut you, too, have, according to report,\nDespite your posing as a holy dude,\nImperfect spiritual pulchritude\nFor so severe a judge. May't please the court,\nWe shall appeal and take our case at once\nBefore that higher court, a taller dunce.\n\nSir, what were _you_ without the press? What spreads\nThe fame of your existence, once a week,\nFrom the Pacific Mail dock to the Heads,\nWarning the people you're about to wreak\nUpon the human ear your Sunday freak?\nWhereat the most betake them to their bed\nThough some prefer to slumber in the pews\nAnd nod assent to your hypnotic views.\n\nUnhappy man! can you not still your tongue\nWhen (like a luckless brat afflict with worms,\nBy cruel fleas intolerably stung,\nOr with a pang in its small lap) it squirms?\nStill must it vulgarize your feats of lung?\nNo preaching better were, the sun beneath,\nIf you had nothing there behind your teeth."}
