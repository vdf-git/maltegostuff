Cow skull \nin the pasture; back room \nwhere the brain was: \nspacious hut for me. \n\nSmall then, and smaller. \nMy desire's to stay alive \nand be no larger \nthan a sliver \nlodged in my own heart. \n\nAnd if the heart's a rock \nI'll whack it with this tin \ncup and eat the sparks, \nalways screaming, always \nscreaming for more."}
