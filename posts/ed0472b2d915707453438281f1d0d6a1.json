{"subject": "My Heart, When First The Black-Bird Sings", "text": "MY heart, when first the blackbird sings,\nMy heart drinks in the song:\nCool pleasure fills my bosom through\nAnd spreads each nerve along.\n\nMy bosom eddies quietly,\nMy heart is stirred and cool\nAs when a wind-moved briar sweeps\nA stone into a pool\n\nBut unto thee, when thee I meet,\nMy pulses thicken fast,\nAs when the maddened lake grows black\nAnd ruffles in the blast."}
