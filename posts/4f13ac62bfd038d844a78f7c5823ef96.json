{"subject": "Content Written Off Ithaca", "text": "I could not find the little maid Content,\nSo out I rushed, and sought her far and wide;\nBut not where Pleasure each new fancy tried,\nHeading the maze of reeling merriment,\nNor where, with restless eyes and bow half bent,\nLove in a brake of sweetbrier smiled and sighed,\nNor yet where Fame towered crowned and glorified,\nFound I her face, nor wheresoe'er I went.\nSo homeward back I crawled like wounded bird,\nWhen lo! Content sate spinning at my door:\nAnd when I asked her where she was before-\n''Here all the time,'' she said; ''I never stirred;\nToo eager in your search, you passed me o'er,\nAnd, though I called, you neither saw nor heard.''"}
