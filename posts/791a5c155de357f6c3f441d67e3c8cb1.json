{"subject": "Extracts From A Medical Poem. The Stability Of Science", "text": "THE feeble sea-birds, blinded in the storms,\nOn some tall lighthouse dash their little forms,\nAnd the rude granite scatters for their pains\nThose small deposits that were meant for brains. \nYet the proud fabric in the morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sun\nStands all unconscious of the mischief done;\nStill the red beacon pours its evening rays\nFor the lost pilot with as full a blaze,\u00e2\u20ac\u201d\u00c2\u00ad\nNay, shines, all radiance, o\u00e2\u20ac\u2122er the scattered fleet\nOf gulls and boobies brainless at its feet.\n\nI tell their fate, though courtesy disclaims\nTo call our kind by such ungentle names;\nYet, if your rashness bid you vainly dare,\nThink of their doom, ye simple, and beware.\n\nSee where aloft its hoary forehead rears\nThe towering pride of twice a thousand years! \nFar, far below the vast incumbent pile\nSleeps the gray rock from art\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s AEgean isle\nIts massive courses, circling as they rise,\nSwell from the waves to mingle with the skies;\nThere every quarry lends its marble spoil,\nAnd clustering ages blend their common toil;\nThe Greek, the Roman, reared its ancient walls,\nThe silent Arab arched its mystic halls;\nIn that fair niche, by countless billows laved,\nTrace the deep lines that Sydenham engraved;\nOn yon broad front that breasts the changing swell,\nMark where the ponderous sledge of Hunter fell;\nBy that square buttress look where Louis stands,\nThe stone yet warm from his uplifted hands;\nAnd say, O Science, shall thy life-blood freeze,\nWhen fluttering folly flaps on walls like these?"}
