{"subject": "Cape Romain", "text": "The breakers are foaming and dashing along,\nThe pelican sits on the wave;\nThe sea-gull and curlew are mingling their song,\nWith the scream of the winds as they rave.\n\nThe horizon discovers three desolate isles,\nTo life and to verdure unknown;\nSave the rattlesnake, where in his malice he coils,\nOr the myrtle in pity hath grown.\n\nThere are wrecks on the coast\u2014there are bones on the shore.\nAnd a murderer's beacon on high,\nThat invites him to enter, who goes forth no more,\nAnd yields him allurements to die.\n\nO'erpassing in safety the perilous sea,\nThe mariner welcomes the land;\nHow short his illusion\u2014how fatal his glee,\nHis corpse is ashore on the strand.\n\nThe day-star of mercy shall dawn on the scene,\nAnd the signal of piety show\nWhere the wreck of the innocent victim has been,\nAnd guard the survivor from woe.\n\nAh! who to a nation of freemen is dear,\nIf not the bright son of the wave? \nWhen his home, and his wife, and his children, grow near,\nOh! beckon him not to his grave."}
