{"subject": "Boy O' Mine", "text": "'Boy o' mine, boy o' mine, this is my prayer for you,\nThis is my dream and my thought and my care for you:\nStrong be the spirit which dwells in the breast of you,\nNever may folly or shame get the best of you;\nYou shall be tempted in fancied security,\nBut make no choice that is stained with impurity.\n\nBoy o' mine, boy o' mine, time shall command of you\nThought from the brain of you, work from the hand of you;\nVoices of pleasure shall whisper and call to you;\nLuring you far from the hard tasks that fall to you;\nThen as you're meeting life's bitterest test of men,\nGod grant you strength to be true as the best of men.\n\nBoy o' mine, boy o' mine, singing your way along,\nCling to your laughter and cheerfully play along;\nKind to your neighbor be, offer your hand to him,\nYou shall  grow great as your heart shall expand to him;\nBut when for victory sweet you are fighting there,\nKnow that your record of life you are writing there.\n\nBoy o' mine, boy o' mine, this is my prayer for you;\nNever may shame pen one line of despair for you;\nNever may conquest or glory mean all to you;\nCling to your honor whatever shall fall to you;\nRather than victory, rather than fame to you,\nChoose to be true and let nothing bring shame to you.'"}
