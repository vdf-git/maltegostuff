{"subject": "Pleasing Dad", "text": "When I was but a little lad, not more than two or three,\nI noticed in a general way my dad was proud of me.\nHe liked the little ways I had, the simple things I said;\nSometimes he gave me words of praise, sometimes he stroked my head;\nAnd when I'd done a thing worth while, the thought that made me glad\nWas always that I'd done my best, and that would please my dad.\n\nI can look back to-day and see how proud he used to be\nWhen I'd come home from school and say they'd recommended me.\nI didn't understand it then, for school boys never do,\nBut in a vague and general way it seems to me I knew\nThat father took great pride in me, and wanted me to shine,\nAnd that it meant a lot to him when I'd done something fine.\n\nThen one day out of school I went, amid the great world's hum,\nAn office boy, and father watched each night to see me come.\nAnd I recall how proud he was of me that wondrous day\nWhen I could tell him that, unasked, the firm had raised my pay.\nI still can feel that hug he gave, I understand the joy\nIt meant to him to learn that men were trusting in his boy.\n\nI wonder will it please my dad? How oft the thought occurs\nWhen I am stumbling on the paths, beset with briars and burrs!\nHe isn't here to see me now, alone my race I run,\nAnd yet some day I'll go to him and tell him all I've done.\nAnd oh I pray that when we meet beyond life's stormy sea\nThat he may claim the old-time joy of being proud of me."}
