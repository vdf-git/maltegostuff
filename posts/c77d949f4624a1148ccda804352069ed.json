{"subject": "Love\u2019s Fearlessness -", "text": "I love, and therefore silent I remain,\nBecause I love, no jealousy is near;\nI love! and love's expression can restrain,\nAnd nothing gives to me who love a fear.\nI love! and all the loved one's joy is mine,\nThough yielded it may be from others' love;\nAnd Love, sweet Love, entirely, I am thine;\nI place my faith in power of thine to move,\nAnd I will trust thee to the very end.\nMy love will live through each impulsive thought\nThat wayward fancy may for love's sake send.\nLove is by instinct known, and found, not sought,\nYet love to strong faith ever yields at last,\nAnd I so surely love, all doubt is past."}
