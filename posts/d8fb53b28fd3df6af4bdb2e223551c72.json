{"subject": "Restlessness", "text": "Would I had waked this morn where Florence smiles,\nA-bloom with beauty, a white rose full-blown,\nYet rich in sacred dust, in storied stone,\nPrecious past all the wealth of Indian isles-\nFrom olive-hoary Fiesole to feed\nOn Brunelleschi's dome my hungry eye,\nAnd see against the lotus-colored sky,\nSpring the slim belfry graceful as a reed.\nTo kneel upon the ground where Dante trod,\nTo breathe the air of immortality\nFrom Angelo and Raphael-TO BE-\nEach sense new-quickened by a demi-god.\nTo hear the liquid Tuscan speech at whiles,\nFrom citizen and peasant, to behold\nThe heaven of Leonardo washed with gold-\nWould I had waked this morn where Florence smile!"}
