{"subject": "Lines", "text": "Those are the features, those the smiles,\nThat first engag'd my virgin heart:\nI feel the pencil'd image true,\nI feel the mimic pow'r of art.\n\nFor ever on my soul engrav'd\nHis glowing cheek, his manly mien;\nI need not thee, thou painted shade,\nTo tell me what my Love has been.\n\nO dearer now, tho' bent with age,\nThan in the pride of blooming youth!\nI knew not then his constant heart,\nI knew not then his matchless truth.\n\nFull many a year, at random tost,\nThe spot of many an adverse gale,\nTogether, hand in hand, we've stray'd\nO'er dreary hill, and lonely vale.\n\nHope only flattered to betray,\nHer keenest shafts misfortune shot:\nIn spite of prudence, spite of care,\nDependence was our bitter lot.\n\nIll can'st thou bear the sneer of wealth,\nAverted looks, and rustic scorn;\nFor thou wert born to better hopes,\nAnd bright rose thy vernal morn.\n\nThy ev'ning hours to want expos'd,\nI cannot, cannot bear to see:\nWere but thy honest heart at ease,\nI care not what becomes of me.\n\nBut tho', my Love, the winds of woe\nBeat cold upon thy silver hairs,\nThy ANNA'S bosom still is warm;\nAffection still shall soothe thy cares.\n\nAnd Conscience, with clouded ray,\nThe cottage of our age will cheer;\nFriendship will lift our humble latch,\nAnd Pity pour her healing tear."}
