{"subject": "Gertrude", "text": "Many sweet flowers in the prairie shine,\nAnd many in the wood; \nBut the fairest flower of all is mine, \nMy darling young Gertrude. \nHer hazel eyes so roguish bright, \nPilled with her dear soul's radiant light \nHer rosy, pouting lips invite \nThe long, warm kiss: \nAnd yesterday, at last, I heard \nFrom that sweet mouth the welcome word \nThat makes existence bliss: \nMy promised wife, star of my life, \nMy darling young Gertrude!\nMany a bird in the prairie sings,\nAnd many in the wood: \nBut none whose song so sweetly rings \nAs that of my Gertrude: \nThe happy day draws swiftly near, \nWhen, trusting to my love sincere, \nShe will become tenfold more dear,\u2014 \nThat bright, glad day,\nWhen in my loving, loyal arms, \nEnfolding all her glowing charms, \nA thousand times I'll say, \n'My dear, sweet wife! star of my life! \nMy darling young Gertrude!'"}
