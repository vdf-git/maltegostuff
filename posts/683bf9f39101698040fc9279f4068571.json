{"subject": "Memories Of The Blue And Gray", "text": "We are gathered here a feeble few\nOf those who wore the gray-\nThe larger and the better part\nHave mingled with the clay:\nYet not so lost but now and then\nThrough dimming mist we see\nThe deadly calm of Stonewall's face,\nThe lion-front of Lee.\n\nThe men who followed where they led\nAre scattered far and wide-\nIn every valley of the South,\nOn every mountain side,\nThe earth is hallowed by the blood\nOf those who, in the van,\nGave up their lives for what they deemed\nThe sacred rights of man.\n\nAnd you who faced the boys in blue\n(When like a storm they rose),\nAnd played with Life and laughed at Death\nAmong such stalwart foes,\nNeed never cast your eyes to earth\nOr bow your heads with shame-\nThough fortune frown, your names are down\nUpon the Roll Of Fame.\n\nThe flag you followed in the fight\nWill never float again-\nThank God it sunk to endless rest\nWithout a blot or stain!\nAnd in its place 'Old Glory' rose\nWith all its stars restored;\nAnd smiling Peace, with rapture, raised\nA pean to the Lord.\n\nWe love both flags\u2026let smiles and tears\nTogether hold their sway;\nOne won our hearts in days agone-\nOne owns our love today.\nWe claim them both with all their wealth\nOf honor and of fame-\nOne lives, triumphant, in the sun;\nAnd one a hallowed name.\n\nA few short years and 'Yank' and 'Reb,'\nBeneath their native sod,\nWill wait until the Judgement Day\nThe calling voice of God-\nThe Great Commander's smile will beam\nOn that Enrollment Day,\nAlike on him who wore the blue\nAnd him who wore the gray."}
