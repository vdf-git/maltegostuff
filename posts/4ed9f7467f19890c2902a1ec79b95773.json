{"subject": "Inheriting My Grandmother's Nightmare", "text": "Consider the adhesiveness of things\n       to the ghosts that prized them,\nthe 'olden days' of birthday spoons\n       and silver napkin rings.\nToo carelessly I opened\n       that velvet drawer of heirlooms.\nThere lay my grandmother's soul\nbegging under veils of tarnish to be brought back whole.\n\nShe who was always a climate in herself,\n       who refused to vanish\nas the nineteen-hundreds grew older and louder,\n       and the wars worse,\nand her grandchildren, bigger and ruder\n       in her daughter's house.\nHow completely turned around\nher lavender world became, how upside down.\n\nAnd how much, under her 'flyaway' hair,\n       she must have suffered,\nsitting there ignored by the dinner guests\n       hour after candlelit hour,\nrubbed out, like her initials on the silverware,\n       eating little, passing bread,\nuntil the wine's flood, the smoke's blast,\nthe thunderous guffaws at last roared her to bed.\n\nIn her tiny garden of confidence,\n       wasted she felt, and furious.\nShe fled to church, but Baby Jesus\n       had grown out of his manger.\nShe read of Jews in the New Haven Register\n       gassed or buried alive.\nEvery night, at the wheel of an ambulance,\nshe drove and drove, not knowing how to drive.\n\nShe died in '55, paralyzed, helpless.\n       Her no man's land survived.\nI light my own age with a spill\n       from her distress. And there it is,\nher dream, my heirloom, my drive downhill\n       at the wheel of the last bus,\nthe siren's wail, the smoke, the sickly smell.\nThe drawer won't shut again. It never will."}
