{"subject": "Atlas; Or The Minister Of State", "text": "TO THE LORD TREASURER OXFORD\n1710\n\nAtlas, we read in ancient song,\nWas so exceeding tall and strong,\nHe bore the skies upon his back,\nJust as the pedler does his pack;\nBut, as the pedler overpress'd\nUnloads upon a stall to rest,\nOr, when he can no longer stand\nDesires a friend to lend a hand;\nSo Atlas, lest the ponderous spheres\nShould sink, and fall about his ears,\nGot Hercules to bear the pile,\nThat he might sit and rest awhile.\nYet Hercules was not so strong,\nNor could have borne it half so long.\nGreat statesmen are in this condition;\nAnd Atlas is a politician,\nA premier minister of state;\nAlcides one of second rate.\nSuppose then Atlas ne'er so wise;\nYet, when the weight of kingdoms lies\nToo long upon his single shoulders,\nSink down he must, or find upholders."}
