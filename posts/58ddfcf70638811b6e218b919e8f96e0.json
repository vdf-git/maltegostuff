{"subject": "I Trust In Dragons!", "text": "One afternoon I sidetracked into a church,\nmaybe for shelter, maybe for silence.\nRed brick, a soft flutter of moths,\na dark-filled painting on a darkling wall.\n\n           Gee up, dragon, get him! With the south-east wind at your wing!\n\nIn the painting, in a rhythm of creacking pews,\nlike a No-theatre classic - George and the Dragon\nhave led each other on into a sacred contest\neye to eye, known of a thousand years.\n\n          Gee up, dragon, get him! Devour that good-for-nothing George!\n\nThat day in the church, ten wing-hours away, \nI recognised you, Drako, among the monks,\nin the whites of your eyes flashed a golden age,\nwhen, in human skin, you tended tourist flocks.\n\n         Gee up, dragon, get him. Burn down that house of cowards!\n\nTranslated from Estonian by Miriam McIlfatrick-Ksenofontov"}
