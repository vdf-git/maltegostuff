{"subject": "Heart Of Dreams", "text": "Give me a dream of my own \nTo keep in my heart.  \nThat will never part \nFor dreams are many things.  \nThat go on all through life \nGod put dreams in your \nHeart so get up and fight \nBecause there is no doubt  \nYour dreams won't come true \nIf you don't make it a golden rule \nThat is why dreams \nJust come true for a few \nSo keep a dream in your heart \nFor dreams are yours \nSo grow old with them \nAnd never let them part."}
