{"subject": "Picture Puzzle Piece", "text": "One picture puzzle piece\nLyin' on the sidewalk,\nOne picture puzzle piece\nSoakin' in the rain.\nIt might be a button of blue\nOn the coat of the woman\nWho lived in a shoe.\nIt might be a magical bean,\nOr a fold in the red\nVelvet robe of a queen.\nIt might be the one little bite\nOf the apple her stepmother\nGave to Snow White.\nIt might be the veil of a bride\nOr a bottle with some evil genie inside.\nIt might be a small tuft of hair\nOn the big bouncy belly\nOf Bobo the Bear.\nIt might be a bit of the cloak\nOf the Witch of the West\nAs she melted to smoke.\nIt might be a shadowy trace\nOf a tear that runs down an angel's face.\nNothing has more possibilities\nThan one old wet picture puzzle piece."}
