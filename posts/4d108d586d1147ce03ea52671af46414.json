{"subject": "Stella\u2019s Birth-Day. 1724-5 -", "text": "As when a beauteous nymph decays,\nWe say she's past her dancing days;\nSo poets lose their feet by time,\nAnd can no longer dance in rhyme.\nYour annual bard had rather chose\nTo celebrate your birth in prose:\nYet merry folks, who want by chance\nA pair to make a country dance,\nCall the old housekeeper, and get her\nTo fill a place for want of better:\nWhile Sheridan is off the hooks,\nAnd friend Delany at his books,\nThat Stella may avoid disgrace,\nOnce more the Dean supplies their place.\nBeauty and wit, too sad a truth!\nHave always been confined to youth;\nThe god of wit and beauty's queen,\nHe twenty-one and she fifteen,\nNo poet ever sweetly sung,\nUnless he were, like Phoebus, young;\nNor ever nymph inspired to rhyme,\nUnless, like Venus, in her prime.\nAt fifty-six, if this be true,\nAm I a poet fit for you?\nOr, at the age of forty-three,\nAre you a subject fit for me?\nAdieu! bright wit, and radiant eyes!\nYou must be grave and I be wise.\nOur fate in vain we would oppose:\nBut I'll be still your friend in prose:\nEsteem and friendship to express,\nWill not require poetic dress;\nAnd if the Muse deny her aid\nTo have them sung, they may be said.\nBut, Stella, say, what evil tongue\nReports you are no longer young;\nThat Time sits with his scythe to mow\nWhere erst sat Cupid with his bow;\nThat half your locks are turn'd to gray?\nI'll ne'er believe a word they say.\n'Tis true, but let it not be known,\nMy eyes are somewhat dimmish grown;\nFor nature, always in the right,\nTo your decays adapts my sight;\nAnd wrinkles undistinguished pass,\nFor I'm ashamed to use a glass:\nAnd till I see them with these eyes,\nWhoever says you have them, lies.\nNo length of time can make you quit\nHonour and virtue, sense and wit;\nThus you may still be young to me,\nWhile I can better hear than see.\nO ne'er may Fortune show her spite,\nTo make me deaf, and mend my sight!"}
