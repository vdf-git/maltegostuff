{"subject": "The Proof Of Worth", "text": "The Proof Of Worth\nThough victory's proof of the skill you possess,\nDefeat is the proof of your grit;\nA weakling can smile in his days of success,\nBut at trouble's first sign he will quit.\nSo the test of the heart and the test of your pluck\nIsn't skies that are sunny and fair,\nBut how do you stand to the blow that is struck\nAnd how do you battle despair?\n\nA fool can seem wise when the pathway is clear\nAnd it's easy to see the way out,\nBut the test of man's judgment is something to fear,\nAnd what does he do when in doubt?\nAnd the proof of his faith is the courage he shows\nWhen sorrows lie deep in his breast;\nIt's the way that he suffers the griefs that he knows\nThat brings out his worst or his best.\n\nThe test of a man is how much he will bear\nFor a cause which he knows to be right,\nHow long will he stand in the depths of despair,\nHow much will he suffer and fight?\nThere are many to serve when the victory's near\nAnd few are the hurts to be borne,\nBut it calls for a leader of courage to cheer\nThe men in a battle forlorn.\n\nIt's the way you hold out against odds that are great\nThat proves what your courage is worth,\nIt's the way that you stand to the bruises of fate\nThat shows up your stature and girth.\nAnd victory's nothing but proof of your skill,\nVeneered with a glory that's thin,\nUnless it is proof of unfaltering will,\nAnd unless you have suffered to win."}
