{"subject": "My Love My Wife", "text": "Oh! My darling I have loved You all these years,\n Through sickness and health through laughter and tears\n Forty five years we have been together\n In joy and sorrow, fair and foul weather\n Although we're not as young as we used to be\n I have always loved you and at times you have loved me\n I have loved you with all my heart\n I love you right from the start\n There were times when there was a doubt\n Whenever we quarreled, when ever we shout;\n But that soon passed and we would go on as before\n Each day I loved you all the more\n There were times when I didn't show it\n But I still loved you and you know it\n Maybe I didn't love you with a lot of passion\n Yet I loved you always in my fashion\n Maybe I wasn't as sexy as you\n But my love for you was always true\n We raised a family, the kids are grown\n The time has come for us to be alone;\n All these years you have been my life\n My sweetheart, my love, my wife."}
