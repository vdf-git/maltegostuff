To be afraid of thee\nOne must to thine Artillery\nHave left exposed a Friend\u2014\nThan thine old Arrow is a Shot\nDelivered straighter to the Heart\nThe leaving Love behind.\n\nNot for itself, the Dust is shy,\nBut, enemy, Beloved be\nThy Batteries divorce.\nFight sternly in a Dying eye\nTwo Armies, Love and Certainty\nAnd Love and the Reverse."}
