{"subject": "Charisma", "text": "The caterpillar on the lawn\u2015 \nin the name of god, \neating away the copper, \nthe blue veins of thighs.\n\nBarefoot I come to wish \nyou farewell. You must stand\u2015 \nin the decaying woods, \nto pronounce me dead.\n\nThe auburn fawn climbs on \nthe podium, to mimic a birdsong.\nIt was sloth time. Moon was \naway and it was dark.\n\nThe eagle swoops on tiny \nbreasts, popping up from the \nnest of muse. There were no \nfeathers and no beak left."}
