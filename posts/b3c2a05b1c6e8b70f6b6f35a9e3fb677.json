{"subject": "Lucy Gray, Or Solitude", "text": "Oft I had heard of Lucy Gray: \nAnd, when I crossed the wild, \nI chanced to see at break of day \nThe solitary child. \n\nNo mate, no comrade Lucy knew; \nShe dwelt on a wide moor, \n- The sweetest thing that ever grew \nBeside a human door! \n\nYou yet may spy the fawn at play, \nThe hare upon the green; \nBut the sweet face of Lucy Gray \nWill never more be seen. \n\n'To-night will be a stormy night-  \nYou to the town must go; \nAnd take a lantern, Child, to light \nYour mother through the snow.' \n\n'That, Father! will I gladly do: \n'Tis scarcely afternoon-  \nThe minster-clock has just struck two, \nAnd yonder is the moon! ' \n\nAt this the Father raised his hook, \nAnd snapped a faggot-band; \nHe plied his work; - and Lucy took \nThe lantern in her hand. \n\nNot blither is the mountain roe: \nWith many a wanton stroke \nHer feet disperse the powdery snow, \nThat rises up like smoke. \n\nThe storm came on before its time: \nShe wandered up and down; \nAnd many a hill did Lucy climb: \nBut never reached the town. \n\nThe wretched parents all that night \nWent shouting far and wide; \nBut there was neither sound nor sight \nTo serve them for a guide. \n\nAt day-break on a hill they stood \nThat overlooked the moor; \nAnd thence they saw the bridge of wood, \nA furlong from their door. \n\nThey wept- and, turning homeward, cried, \n'In heaven we all shall meet; ' \n- When in the snow the mother spied \nThe print of Lucy's feet. \n\nThen downwards from the steep hill's edge \nThey tracked the footmarks small; \nAnd through the broken hawthorn hedge, \nAnd by the long stone-wall; \n\nAnd then an open field they crossed: \nThe marks were still the same; \nThey tracked them on, nor ever lost; \nAnd to the bridge they came. \n\nThey followed from the snowy bank \nThose footmarks, one by one, \nInto the middle of the plank; \nAnd further there were none! \n\n- Yet some maintain that to this day \nShe is a living child; \nThat you may see sweet Lucy Gray \nUpon the lonesome wild. \n\nO'er rough and smooth she trips along, \nAnd never looks behind; \nAnd sings a solitary song \nThat whistles in the wind."}
