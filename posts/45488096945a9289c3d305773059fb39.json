{"subject": "A Poet's Epitaph", "text": "Art thou a Statist in the van \nOf public conflicts trained and bred? \n--First learn to love one living man; \n'Then' may'st thou think upon the dead. \n\nA Lawyer art thou?--draw not nigh! \nGo, carry to some fitter place \nThe keenness of that practised eye, \nThe hardness of that sallow face. \n\nArt thou a Man of purple cheer? \nA rosy Man, right plump to see? \nApproach; yet, Doctor, not too near, \nThis grave no cushion is for thee. \n\nOr art thou one of gallant pride, \nA Soldier and no man of chaff? \nWelcome!--but lay thy sword aside, \nAnd lean upon a peasant's staff. \n\nPhysician art thou? one, all eyes, \nPhilosopher! a fingering slave, \nOne that would peep and botanise \nUpon his mother's grave? \n\nWrapt closely in thy sensual fleece, \nO turn aside,--and take, I pray, \nThat he below may rest in peace, \nThy ever-dwindling soul, away! \n\nA Moralist perchance appears; \nLed, Heaven knows how! to this poor sod: \nAnd he has neither eyes nor ears; \nHimself his world, and his own God; \n\nOne to whose smooth-rubbed soul can cling \nNor form, nor feeling, great or small; \nA reasoning, self-sufficing thing, \nAn intellectual All-in-all! \n\nShut close the door; press down the latch; \nSleep in thy intellectual crust; \nNor lose ten tickings of thy watch \nNear this unprofitable dust. \n\nBut who is He, with modest looks, \nAnd clad in homely russet brown? \nHe murmurs near the running brooks \nA music sweeter than their own. \n\nHe is retired as noontide dew, \nOr fountain in a noon-day grove; \nAnd you must love him, ere to you \nHe will seem worthy of your love. \n\nThe outward shows of sky and earth, \nOf hill and valley, he has viewed; \nAnd impulses of deeper birth \nHave come to him in solitude. \n\nIn common things that round us lie \nSome random truths he can impart,-- \nThe harvest of a quiet eye \nThat broods and sleeps on his own heart. \n\nBut he is weak; both Man and Boy, \nHath been an idler in the land; \nContented if he might enjoy \nThe things which others understand. \n\n--Come hither in thy hour of strength; \nCome, weak as is a breaking wave! \nHere stretch thy body at full length; \nOr build thy house upon this grave."}
