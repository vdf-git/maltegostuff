{"subject": "Le vieux Moulin", "text": "Is a well amid wet grass the road abuts.\nA layer of humus where oak beams once stood\ngives two clumps of wild loosestrife the guts\nto stand up tall like trees within a wood.\n\nTwo bands of stalks it lies between.\nAgainst them, right and left, its legs are packed,\nRising to hips quite worthy of a queen,\nold gold lying on a millstone that's cracked.\n\nFrom above between two purple patches viewed,\nRecumbent golden flesh of a Sybil divine\nin a Mycenaean shaft, but maddeningly crude\nmasked upon the slivers she can recline\n\nfrom breaches in the Ardennes cellar wall.\nThe silence thickens when the mask is broken,\nriver ravine air forms a calm, enduring hall\nwhen the clenched jaw releases words unspoken:\n\n\"All you call gold may be just bronze and brown.\nI at my level see the roots that bind the ground\nand grey fungi made of glued moth down,\nand past my hand ants lug their larvae round.'\n\nTranslated by Paul Vincent"}
