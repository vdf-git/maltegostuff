{"subject": "Trial", "text": "I\n\nWhether the idle prisoner through his grate\nWatches the waving of the grass-tuft small,\nWhich, having colonized its rift i' th' wall,\nAccepts God's dole of good or evil fate,\nAnd from the sky's just helmet draws its lot\nDaily of shower or sunshine, cold or hot;-\nWhether the closer captive of a creed,\nCooped up from birth to grind out endless chaff,\nSees through his treadmill-bars the noonday laugh,\nAnd feels in vain, his crumpled pinions breed;-\nWhether the Georgian slave look up and mark,\nWith bellying sails puffed full, the tall cloud-bark\nSink northward slowly,-thou alone seem'st good,\nFair only thou, O Freedom, whose desire\nCan light in muddiest souls quick seeds of fire,\nAnd strain life's chords to the old heroic mood.\nII\n\nYet are there other gifts more fair than thine,\nNor can I count him happiest who has never\nBeen forced with his own hand his chains to sever,\nAnd for himself find out the way divine;\nHe never knew the aspirer's glorious pains,\nHe never earned the struggle's priceless gains.\nOh, block by block, with sore and sharp endeavor,\nLifelong we build these human natures up\nInto a temple fit for Freedom's shrine,\nAnd, Trial ever consecrates the cup\nWherefrom we pour her sacrificial wine."}
