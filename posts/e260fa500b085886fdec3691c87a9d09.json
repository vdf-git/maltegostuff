{"subject": "Possessions", "text": "They spent my life plotting against me.\nWith nothing to do but cultivate themselves,\nbut to be there, aligning their shadows,\nthey were planning to undo me,\nwanting to own me completely.\n\nThey have marched through the rooms,\ntheir presences litter the surfaces\nclose at my elbow calling attention.\nWhen I sleep they begin with their meetings,\nwhen I leave home they hold a convention.\nThe minutes, the notes, the chairman\ncalls order, the lamps signal aye. When I die\nthey'll start in on another,\neasy at first, learning his ways.\nNow they're gone, taken from me, good luck.\nIf I kept them I'd never be free. I'd die\nand have to begin picking everything up,\nall the waste paper, baby teeth, beards,\nI'd have to go back for the fingernails.\n\nSo I'm shut of them, all the gossip and malice,\nthe tables, the chairs with their jokes on me.\nAll the prying. the scandals. The telephone\nstored it all up. the books lied to me.\n\nThat's why I came here, bringing nothing.\nThere was nothing to do but leave things.\nI saved only a few: smells of tobacco\nand blankets, a dream of a waterfall,\na length of ribbon, my name, my number,\nthe holes in my suitcase."}
