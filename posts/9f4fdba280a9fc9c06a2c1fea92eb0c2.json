{"subject": "In the 70's, I Confused Macram? and Macabre", "text": "I. \nI wanted the macabre plant holder \nhanging in Janet and Chrissy's apartment. \nMy friend said her cousin tried to kill himself \nby putting his head through the patterns \nof in his mother's spiderplant hanger, but \nthe hook broke from the ceiling and he fell \nknocking over their lava lamp, their 8-track player. \nHis brother almost died a week later when \nhe became tangled in the milfoil at Echo Lake. \nI said it could have been a very \nmacram? summer for that family. \n\nII. \nWhen I looked outside for sticks to make a God's Eye \nto hang my bedroom wall, I found a mouse \nflattened, its white spine stretching past its tail. \nAnd a few feet away from that, \na dead bird with an open chest. \nIts veins wrapped tightly together. \nThis neighborhood with its macram? details \ncrushed into the street. I wanted \nmy mother to console me, remind me \nthat sometimes we escape. \nBut when I returned to my house \nit was empty, except for the macabre owl \nmy mother had almost finished, its body left \non the kitchen table, while she ran out to buy more beads."}
