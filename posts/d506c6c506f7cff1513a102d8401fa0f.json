{"subject": "To Mother Jacqueline", "text": "My dear and lovely Mother \nVery strong and never tired \nFor us you could stand the fire \nTo make us be more than others. Forever pretty Jacqueline \nI want you to know, beside all \nI promise not to ever fall \nBelow what you drawed, yes that line. Yes! Your Mother named you Tchieudji \nLiterally means visitor \nNo! A gift from the Creator \nOur education was a gift. I know, whatever I've become \nIs because of you my Mother \nTaught me to be above others \nAnd care every time I come home. Whatever I may do, ever \nYou remain, yes, my only love \nThe only reason why I move \nAnd I thank you forever."}
