{"subject": "Sonnet Vi", "text": "Give me the treble of thy horns and hoofs, \nThe ponderous undertones of 'bus and tram, \nA garret and a glimpse across the roofs \nOf clouds blown eastward over Notre Dame, \nThe glad-eyed streets and radiant gatherings \nWhere I drank deep the bliss of being young, \nThe strife and sweet potential flux of things \nI sought Youth's dream of happiness among! \nIt walks here aureoled with the city-light, \nForever through the myriad-featured mass \nFlaunting not far its fugitive embrace, -- \nHeard sometimes in a song across the night, \nCaught in a perfume from the crowds that pass, \nAnd when love yields to love seen face to face."}
