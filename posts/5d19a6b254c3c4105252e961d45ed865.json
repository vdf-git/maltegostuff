{"subject": "Fragment Of A Proposed Drama 1832. Alcibiades Loquitur.", "text": "--Like a great river, toward the rising sun\nBroad Hellespont is flowing: far beyond,\nOver a land of never--dying names,\nTower the brows of Ida. I can see\nThe white waves chase each other on the deep,\nBetween our Chersonese and Vulcan's isle;\nAnd there, where the azure level of the sea\nFlush meets the laughing blue, full many a league\nMy thought sails daily till above the waves\nGray headlands rise, and Acro--Sunium's fane\nTraces its glittering shafts upon the sky.\nO A thens--O my mother--couldst thou now\nMake peace in my torn bosom: couldst thou now\nReceive thy son, as thou receivedst him,\nWith thronging ports and humming populace,--\nCould I but now be standing as I stood\nUpon the sacred way, where grateful passed\nThe holy pomp beneath my guarding hand!\n--But why thus weak? Is it that all is lost?\nMay not the tumult of wild battle yet\nBe poured around me? may not yet again\nThe horse wave dash about the ploughing prow, And subject cities"}
