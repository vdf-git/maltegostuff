{"subject": "The Long, Lone Road", "text": "YOU that had the soft path\nAnd the lights, brightly glowing,\nYour laugh is very still, and your hands are very chill,\nAnd where may you be going?\n'Though the light of dawn be breaking,\nAnd the birds of morning call \u2014\nAll the flowers and trees awaking \u2014\n'Tis the long road I'm taking,\nThe long road, the lone road that has no end at all.'\nYou that have the red gold,\nAnd the gift of money-making,\nSince your journey has no end, sure you'll need a heap to spend,\nAnd how much will you be taking?\n'O there's little need for spending\nWhen the grey shadows fall,\nAnd the twilight lies unending\nOn the way I'll soon be wending \u2014\nThe long road, the lone road that has no end at all.'\nYou that had the choice wines,\nIn the frail cups glowing \u2014\nIs there any need to ask if you'll take a golden flask\nOn the road you'll be going?\n'When I walk, a spirit shrinking,\nWhere the grey shadows fall,\nThere'll be little need, I'm thinking,\nFor the rich delights of drinking\nOn the long road, the lone road that has no end at all!'\nYou that sought the rich man\nAnd the ladies \u2014 jewelled, glowing \u2014\nSince the way is far to wend, sure you'll need a true-heart friend\nOn the road you'll be going?\n'Nay! \u2014 and not an ear shall heed me\nThough I call, call, call,\nWhen the beckoning shadows lead me;\nAnd no prayer of heart shall speed me\nOn the long road, the lone road that has no end at all!'\nYou that had the hard heart\nAnd the selfish soul uncaring,\nIs there any deed at all that shall let a comfort fall\nOn the road you'll be going?\n'Hush! the lights of day have ended,\nAnd the grey shadows fall,\nAnd, by no sweet thought attended,\nI must wander, unbefriended,\nDown the long road, the lone road that has no end at all!'"}
