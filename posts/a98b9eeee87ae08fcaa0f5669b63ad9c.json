{"subject": "Woodman And Echo", "text": "Close Echo hears the woodman's axe,\nTo double on it, as in glee,\nWith clap of hands, and little lacks\nOf meaning in her repartee.\nFor all shall fall,\nAs one has done,\nThe tree of me,\nOf thee the tree;\nAnd unto all\nThe fate we wait\nReveals the wheels\nWhereon we run:\nWe tower to flower,\nWe spread the shade,\nWe drop for crop,\nAt length are laid;\nAre rolled in mould,\nFrom chop and lop:\nAnd are we thick in woodland tracks,\nOr tempting of our stature we,\nThe end is one, we do but wax\nFor service over land and sea.\nSo, strike! the like\nShall thus of us,\nMy brawny woodman, claim the tax.\nNor foe thy blow,\nThough wood be good,\nAnd shriekingly the timber cracks:\nThe ground we crowned\nShall speed the seed\nOf younger into swelling sacks.\n\nFor use he hews,\nTo make awake\nThe spirit of what stuff we be:\nOur earth of mirth\nAnd tears he clears\nFor braver, let our minds agree;\nAnd then will men\nWithin them win\nAn Echo clapping harmony."}
