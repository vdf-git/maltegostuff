{"subject": "In This Field", "text": "Queued workers process in silent rows\nwearing faces grooved by commerce into masks.\nEtched inside a timeworn intaglio\nis an unconscious V that is deep and thin.\nBeneath tin arms marking ornate clocks,\nmanque figurines pirouette each half hour;\nas clockwork ticks and tocks into thunder grow\nbecoming the hammer blows of a grand piano in Dis.\nEtched inside a timeworn intaglio\nare paper channels where ancient voices remain.\nEyes fail on the heads of frayed apparitions\nunable to decipher what is real and who is not.\n\nClockwork ticks and tocks into thunder grow,\nunder corrugated rooftops eigth-notes pound\nhome into a perlieu of rapt Perdition.\nUnable to look out of windows, unable to go outside;\neyes fail on the heads of frayed apparitions\ndriven to desperation by the suffering of supermen.\n\nSanity smells like formaldehyde\nit is stuffed into a dusty jar, into a funeral \nhome, into a perlieu of rapt Perdition.\nThere is no jubilee in faith, only in freedom\nonly broken shackles grant manumission.\n\nAdmire the beatitudes sandwiched within sweet \nunconscious V, for \nsanity smells like formaldehyde; \nit is pinned down, analyzed by children\nbiologists.\nBeneath tin arms marking clocks\nwearing faces grooved by commerce into masks;\nonly broken shackles grant manumission.\nOn the floors of major cities, on a million broken cuffs\nqueued workers process in silent rows."}
