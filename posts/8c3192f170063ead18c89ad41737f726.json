{"subject": "Lotus Hurt By The Cold", "text": "How many times, like lotus lilies risen  \n Upon the surface of a river, there  \n Have risen floating on my blood the rare  \nSoft glimmers of my hope escaped from prison.\n\nSo I am clothed all over with the light\n And sensitive beautiful blossoming of passion;\n Till naked for her in the finest fashion  \nThe flowers of all my mud swim into sight.  \n\nAnd then I offer all myself unto  \n This woman who likes to love me: but she turns\n A look of hate upon the flower that burns  \nTo break and pour her out its precious dew.  \n\nAnd slowly all the blossom shuts in pain,  \n And all the lotus buds of love sink over  \n To die unopened: when my moon-faced lover,\nKind on the weight of suffering, smiles again."}
