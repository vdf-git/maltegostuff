{"subject": "My Nevada", "text": "Back east some say, there's no life out in Nevada\n Others say, oh yeah I was there once, I gambled and lost it all,\n in Nevada.\n But I wonder, if they really know my Nevada.\n\n As I get up in the morning, I can hear the coyotes a yelping.\n Then on my run, I see a doe and her fawn playing and oh, there's\n a couple of ground squirrels a playing.\n Then before I know it, my run is over.\n\n I then heard a story, from a neighbor.\n The fish are biting, on the upper part of the Humboldt River.\n\n Now I wonder what they would say,\n Did God really put all this in Nevada?"}
