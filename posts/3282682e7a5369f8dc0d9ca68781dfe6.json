{"subject": "Apollo Laughs", "text": "'APOLLO laughs,' the proverb tells,\nFar echo of old oracles,\nA Delphic waif, \u2014'Once in the year,\nApollo laughs.' O laughter clear\nAs sunshine, blithe as golden bells!\nWhat mortal folly parallels\nOlympian jest and so impels\nTo mirth till Heaven's bright charioteer,\nApollo, laughs?\n'Tis when the annual critic knells\nThe death of poetry, while swells\nSome faint, fresh wood-note, pioneer\nOf music earth shall thrill to hear.\nThen at Apollo's infidels\nApollo laughs."}
