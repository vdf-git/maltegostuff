{"subject": "The Midas Touch", "text": "A clear October day with all the world\nA blaze of gold where frost had touched the leaves,\nThe goldenrod's tall scepters by the fence,\nThe harvest's gold in heaps and stacks and sheaves.\nMy eyes were gladdened by the friendly sun,\nMy thoughts were gay as melodies of birds,\nI walked along the road, while in my heart\nWas golden song that sought to find the words.\nSome thought... I can't recall it... broke the spell,\nSome memory with hate and hurt imbued,\nRose up like fog to gray the radiant scene\nWhile in my heart dark distillations brewed.\nMy swinging stride slowed to a dragging plod,\nMy pleasant dreams and happy musings fled.\nThe world itself was golden as before\nUntil my thoughts had turned that gold to lead.\nI had reversed the Midas touch of old.\nI practice now to turn dull lead to gold."}
