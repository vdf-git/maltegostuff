{"subject": "A POLITICALLY INCORRECT ODE TO WHITMAN", "text": "Whitman isn't in\nHe will not be in\nThis year or the next\n\nHe's gone out\nFar out where the two\nAmericas meet like kissing whales\n\nBeyond the net\nOf the universities\nWhitman celebrates his absence\n\nOld grampus\nWithout a postmodern\nStitch on him he reads himself\n\nSitting naked\nOn leaves of grass\nSounding his barbaric yawp\n\nForever thirty-seven\nAnd in perfect health chewing\nThe heads off dandelions and theorists\n\nWhich right-thinking critic\nWould not like to put to sleep\nThis unconcerned ecologically hazardous\n\nPhallogocentric brute\nOnce and for all in that\nEndlessly rocking cradle of his?\n\nBut damn Whitman!\nThere's no putting him out\nHe says his sex contains all bodies, souls\n\nThis his self-description:\nStern, acrid, large, undissuadable\nAnd help! Also draining the pent-up rivers\n\nOf himself\nInto women and demanding\nPerfection from his love-spendings\n\nWhitman alters\nWhat he grandly calls\nThe base of all metaphysics\n\nHis gods\nAre stones and sinews\nOr an occult Brahma encountered\n\nInterminably\nFar back on that reckless\nPassage to India descending radiating\n\nHis incantatory texts\nAnd striding back and forth between\nVaunt'd Ionia and Sanskrit and the Vedas\n\nAffected by a chronic logorrhoea\nIt's clear the fellow abhors silence, babbling\nAll the time of puzzles to be solv'd and blanks to be fill'd\n\nBlissfully ignorant\nThat erasure is essential\nWords treacherous and that doubt wafts in every human soul\n\nAh how I'd like\nTo introduce Walt to wordplay\nBrackets and all the joys of paranomasia\n\nHow he'd love it too!\nWhit(e)man caring not a whit\nCareening down passion's witless slopes\n\nWaltzing with Whitman\nCould be such fun but he flatly\nRefuses to rise to all my intellectual baits\n\nHe says he will not be\nDarken'd and daz'd by books any more\nHe will steer for deep waters only and the farthest\n\nShore\nAnd, sorry, poor dullards\nNoodling in the groves of academe\n\nWhitman will not\nBe in this year or the next\nIt's the uncharted courses he's out to explore!"}
