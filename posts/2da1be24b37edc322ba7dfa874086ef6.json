{"subject": "Spring", "text": "When winter, with a frown severe,\nHad parted with the worn--out year;\nThe worn--out year, in health decay'd,\nHad run the course--to bloom and fade;\nA snow--wreath'd mantle close infolds,\nA clasp of icy diamonds holds;\nHer former pleasantness forgot,\nHer woods, her groves, remember'd not.\nThe lovely varying tints of green\nFaded as if they'd never been,\nFor who that sees that poplar now\nWould think e'er verdure cloth'd its brow!\nIts robes are gone, and there remain\nAutumnal leaves of yellow stain;\nThe blustering tyrant long had torn\nThe lingering leaf from the poor thorn,--\nThe lingering leaf, though fond to stay,\nWas swept by the rude blast away;\nAnd, falling on the russet ground,\nGave to the ear a wintry sound.\n\nBut Time, whom monarchs must obey,\nNow melts this frozen pomp away;\nSending his harbingers the hours\nBefore, to speak for fragrant bowers;\nBidding the green--rob'd Spring come forth,\nAnd strike the Tyrant of the north.\nWith lightsome foot they steal away,\nAnd find her with her birds at play;\nPouring such songs in the young ear,\nAs suit the season of the year.\n\nFlora the pattern flowers was showing,\nWhich on her couch were sweetly blowing;\nWhile the light zephyr, pertly gay,\nNow brought the scents, now bore away.\n''Accept, sweet Spring,'' gay Flora said,\n''This snowdrop with its lowly head;\nWrapt up in many a fleece of snow,\nThe little lady loves to go;\nBut her pale cheek would ne'er be seen,\nDid I not trim her coif with green.\nMy sweetest violet next behold,--\nHow blue it looks, inhuman cold!\nYet not thy chilling hand can stay\nThose sweets that scorn to wait for May!\nThe harebell now her goblet bears\nWith brimful cup of dewy tears,\nWhich o'er primroses pale she sheds,\nThat scarce have strength to leave their beds,\nTill daisies and gay cowslips lead\nTheir weaker sisters o'er the mead,\nAnd pendant leaves begin to spread\nA waving shelter over head;\nThe woods and groves await thy will,\nThe sickly plant to spare or kill;\nCome then, thou sower of the meads,\nAnd scatter all the promis'd seeds!\nWhen done, where'er thou mov'st along,\nLeaves, plants, and flowers shall round thee throng;\nWhich wandering near the tinkling rill,\nShall, stooping, seem to listen still.''\n\nNot all the incense Flora pours--\nNot all the offerings of the hours,\nCould make her leave her blessed retreat,\nHad Hope not charm'd her from her seat;\nShe, with a hand held out to bless,\nAnd smiles that look'd like happiness,\nDeclar'd 'twas ever to be found;\nThen folding the sweet hours around,\nBade her their joyous footsteps heed,\nNor fear to sow the smallest seed.\n\nFearful she rose, lest the rough wind\nTo infant buds should prove unkind;--\n''Though now they seem with health to glow,\nTheir painted leaves may never blow;\nShould blights arise, oft met before,\nI ne'er should see these nurslings more;\nBut since the hours have led the way,\nHave bath'd in tears this April day,\nThrough all the groves once more I'll range,\nOnce more their dusky liveries change.''\nA flowery chaplet binds her hair,\n(The sweetest wreath a Nymph can wear,)\nHer dark green robe was border'd round\nWith every flower that loves the ground;\nHer tresses, negligently gay,\nStray'd far behind, too fond of play,\nBecause her curls it sadly teases\nTo be pull'd rudely by the breezes;\nA basket o'er her arm was hung,\nAnd plenteous were the seeds she flung;\nThe fanning zephyrs help'd her toil,\nAnd mix'd the seeds with every soil;\nTo the hoar rock the ashlings bear,\nWho doubt their hold and tremble there,\nBut, when a footing once they find,\nCourt the rough crag, and scorn the wind.\n\nNow fluttering leaves crowd on the spray,\nAnd birds, more fluttering still than they,\nThe freshest, softest mosses cull,--\nFrom warmest sheep the warmest wool,--\nThe pliant hair to bind around,--\nThe firmest clay to lay the ground,\nAnd, to support the mossy roof,\nSome well--known twig of 'custom'd proof,\nAnd, that the nestlings mayn't be found,\nWith bark the nest is roughcast round;\nThe brittle eggs in feathers lie,\nThe leafy door deceives the eye;\nThe little parent, doom'd to share\nThe pleasures with a parent's care,\nIn darkest foliage hides her head,\nOf birds, of beasts, of man afraid;\nWhile on the leafy neighbouring tree\nHer sweet mate keeps her company;\nAnd, when the young ones chirp for food,\nHe skims the brook, and scours the wood;\nThe gilded insects catch his eye;--\nWhy dost thou shine, then, glittering fly?\nThy lustre only serves to show\nThy covert to thy deadliest foe!\n\nBut now still Eve her mantle threw\nO'er the soft sky of sweetest blue;\nThe happy bird on topmost spray,\n''Singing the last song of the day,''\nRejoic'd aloud that th' hour of rest\nWas rocking now her quiet nest,\nAnd that she knew the rising morn\nWould show her many a hoard of corn;\nAt distance saw a wandering tribe\nThat every darkening thicket ey'd;\nAnd, where the matted moss had wound\nThe hawthorn's antique root around,\nAll full of mirth, and full of glee,\nThey hope the blackbird's nest to see,\nWhose bright blue eggs, in graceful line,\nWould 'midst the rows of pewter shine;\nThere speckl'd and the brown unite,\nThe iron--gray and yellow--white;\nNor could the little wren's escape,\nThough smallest thing of oval shape.\nThese plunderers, as others do,\nHang out their ill--got wealth to view,\nWhen dressers deck'd for Sunday's show\nCall forth their platters row by row;\nWhat though by some unlucky stroke\nThe king or queen or prince is broke;\nWhat though they can no more contain\nThe mantling juice in every vein,\nTo show you that they yet are there,\nThey edge behind, and half appear,\nStill eking out the grand design\nOf making all the house look fine.\nWhat more could high--priced baubles do!\nGo, search the empty world through!\nThe hard--wrought, far--sought, diamond bring--\nThat much admired glittering thing;\nFrom China or Japan go draw\nThe gilded chair and works of show;\nBid France her silken loom employ,\nAnd Gobelins weave the fall of Troy;\nPanama bid her pearls dispose\nIn innocent and humble rows;\nYet still, if such things do but please,\nThe cottage shelf may rival these;\nFor all depends, we mostly find,\nUpon the eye within the mind;\nThen, Ignorance, in quiet rest,\nThou'rt soonest pleas'd, and cheaply blest!\n\nBut think not yet the search is o'er,\nAnd school--imps look for eggs no more;\nFor now among the yellow broom\nYou hear their little busy hum.\nThe watching parent from his tower\nListens, and tunes his pipe no more;\nBut, as the satchel--boy draws near,\nHis bristling feathers shake with fear;\nFrom bough to bough he hops, and tries\nTo lead from home their searching eyes;\nA broken wing pretends to show\nDragg'd on the ground, and fluttering low,\nDisabl'd; see, he cannot fly,\nThough oft he lamely seems to try;\nDeceiv'd, the imps believe it true,\nAnd through the prickling hedge pursue,\nTill scratch'd and miserably torn,\nAnd bled by every wounding thorn,\nThe happy parent darts on high,\nAnd almost seems to reach the sky.\nAmaz'd, provok'd, the sufferers now\nExamine every twisted bough;\nToo soon the quick--ey'd rifler sees\nThe well--hid nest midst arching trees;\nSoon, soon he bears them into day,\nAnd laughing hurries all away.\n\nNow Morn in all her bloom arose,\nHer sleeping--curtains half unclose;\nAnd looking from her crimson bed,\nOn Night's pale cheek warm blushes spread;\nHer saffron robe gay woodbine tied,\nWhich nodded to the breeze that sigh'd;\nHer golden slippers, pearl'd with dew,\nA riband bound of azure hue;\nAnd in her hand a vase of flowers\nThat ope and close at certain hours;\nHer chamber leaves; and in her car,\nThat erst was once the morning star,\nBegan her journey through the sky,\nBidding each shade of orient dye\nFall on the mountain's hoary head,\nWhere curling mists gray honours shed,--\nThere watch the god of rising day,\nAnd in devotion melt away.\n\n'Twas now the ploughman whistl'd o'er\nThose surrow'd fields he mow'd before;\nAnd nut--brown Labour, hard of hand,\nHad not one moment's leave to stand;\nNot e'en the resting--spade to hold\nWhile some strange village tale was told.\n'Tis Eve that Leisure brings along,\nCompanion of the tale and song;\nAt her approach, in sober weeds,\nWhen wandering through the daisied meads,\nHer thoughtful musings shepherds tell\nTo bid the gaudy sun farewell.\nYears seem to've shown her all her folly,--\nTo've thrown a shade of melancholy\nAcross her brow, and ever hung\nTh' instructive lesson on her tongue.\n\nBut not to scorn the aids of dress,\nAnd make her person please the less,\nThink not, all ornament refusing,\nOr subjects that are but amusing,\nShe will not take an equal part,\nOr play--unless to win the heart.\n'Tis she who blows the pipe so shrill,\nAnd winds the note around the hill,\nTill nymphs and swains the signal hear,\nAnd dancing in the dale appear.\nWith veil thrown up she joins the throng,\nNor grave nor gay she moves along;\nWith matron--mixture in her air,\nNor void of mirth, nor free from care;\nDress'd in a robe of clouded gray,\nHer mourning for the loss of Day,\nWhose parting beams her toils renew\nTo sprinkle every herb with dew;\nThe pearly dew, ''so sweetly clear,\nTo hang in every cowslip's ear,''\nThere trembling till the morning's ray\nShall see it shine and melt away.\nFor now her mists were curling round,\nAnd tall dark shadows stalk'd the ground,\nWhile twilight close the vapours drew,\nHoodwink'd the sky and clos'd the view;\nTill through th' expanse the sailing moon\nNow bright appears, now hid in gloom,\nHer face half showing; then a cloud\nEnwraps the whole in fleecy shroud;\nThe fleecy shroud grows now more bright,\n''Turning its lining on the night,''\nThin and more thin its veil is seen,\nTill the full orb looks through between;\nOn ether borne it glides in state,\nAnd slowly seeks the western gate;\nStill faintly imitating day,\nLighting the traveller on his way,\nWho else had from the cottage seen\nThe twinkling rush, and blest its light serene.\n\nBut sober joys to Eve belong,\nThe cheerful fire, the happy throng.\nShe sees the housewife oft prepare\nThe favourite dish and easy chair,\nTo welcome home her labouring lord,\nAnd spread some dainty on his board;\nHer face displaying joy and care,\nWhich spread a change of beauty there,\nThat by the vague impartial eye\nMight on the cheek neglected die.\nNot so; he eats the dish she dresses,\nTells her she's kind, and likes her messes;\nAbroad for dainties he'll not roam,\nFor every thing is best at home.\nThe little prattlers have their share\nProportioned with exactest care;\nThe young ones on each knee are set,--\nCalls this good boy, and that his pet;\nThe rest all climbing up his side,\nPetition for to--morrow's ride.\n\nThus closes many a rural day,\nFrom ploughing fields to mowing hay,\nAnd on to harvest's golden reign,\nTill winter sweeps the barren plain;\nStill every season finds him blest\nWhose wishes on his conscience rest;\nRest ever must that man attend\nWho is to all his kind a friend!"}
