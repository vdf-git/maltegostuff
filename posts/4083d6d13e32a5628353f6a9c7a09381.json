{"subject": "Sonnet Xi.  To Mr Jackson Of Exeter.", "text": "Tho' Winter's storms embrown the dusky vale,\nAnd dark and wistful wains the low'ring year;\nTho' bleak the Moor, forlorn the Cots appear,\nAnd thro' the hawthorn sighs the sullen gale;\nYet do thy Strains most rare, thy Lays ne'er fail,\n'Midst the drear Scene my drooping heart to cheer;\nWarm the chill blood, and draw the rapturous tear.\nWhether thou lov'st in mournful mood to wail\nLycid, ''bright Genius of the sounding shore,''\nOr else with slow and solemn hymns to move\nMy thoughts to Piety and Virtue's lore;\nBut chiefest when, (if Delia grace the measure)\nThy Lyre, o'erwhelming all my soul in pleasure,\nRolls the soft song of joy and endless love,"}
