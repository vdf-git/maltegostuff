{"subject": "Recognition", "text": "I\n\n'Papa, tell me where the whole world ends!' \u2014\nPhilosophically, solution I request.\nAnswers he: 'See, where the sun descends,\nJust behind that hut, beyond hill's crest.'\nReally? If it's so \u2014 I would not think:\nCatch up with the setting sun! I run,\nIn a silver net of tears, up, to the brink,\nWhere the whole world ends and hides the sun!\nEyes are begging the Siberian God\nNot to make my longing all in vain.\nAll the zillion years before me nod,\nTrembling in the snow: Be blessed again.\n\nII\n\nBack of me, my father \u2014 tiny dot.\nToward the sun is galloping my heart.\nNow, I run uphill and reach the hut!\nEagerness still beckons, won't depart.\nTo the bonfire, over howling pit,\nStretch my lips, my body would descend.\nPapa, see, the world goes on a bit,\nAnd there is no, is no, is no end.\nPapa cannot hear. A star will blanch.\nPapa cannot see, out of the blue,\nHow a boy becomes an avalanche\nMade of light and wonderment anew."}
