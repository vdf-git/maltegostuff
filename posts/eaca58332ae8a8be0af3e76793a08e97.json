{"subject": "On Seeing Charlotte Bront\u00eb's Underwear with my Daughter in Haworth", "text": "\"Are they real?\" We have pages of kitchen utensils and books \nand candlesticks and nibs, but the charcoal pencil and new sketchpad\nare squat as aubergines in her hands in front of this display.\n\nWith bad weather forecast and light silting up in cramped windows,\nwe are the only visitors. The year settles in a corner of the room,\nhas removed its white gloves, tip by tip, and set to one side\n\nits summer purse of bibelots and sheen. Half-term of her final year,\nwe are sightseers intent on moors. In the morning, her windcheater\nand red wellies will bestow the dust of summer festivals upon\n\nsullen, wind-soaked sheep. We will park, and walk ourselves \ninto the final, cutting rain between pages of her favorite book.\nShe wants to go all the way to Top Withens, or the house they say\n\nmust have been Top Withens, given its loneliness and set. But now \nis artifacts and souvenirs: a perfume with too much musk in it,\na jar of damson jam which we probably won't open until past\n\nits sell-by date. We are buying the word \"damson.\" And we are buying\ntime. \"Are they real?\" she asks me, and I watch her reckon the distance\nbetween what should and should never be seen. We have fallen short.\n\nShe draws, and what she draws is rain falling slant inside the bedroom;\nthe bed as a box of leaves and stones and, within the display case, \nshe hangs from the clothes rail, little moons. On the mannequin, \n\nwater lilies stand in for morning dress, and the backdrop is marbled \nin what looks to me like veins and arteries. But when I flick through \nthe sketchpad in the B&amp;B, all the pages, what is left of them, are clean. \n\nNext day, she leaves it in the car. When she moves away, she will leave\nit again, a sketchpad with no name on it and only the faintest traces \nof where she made skies of darned linen, and unfastened every stitch."}
