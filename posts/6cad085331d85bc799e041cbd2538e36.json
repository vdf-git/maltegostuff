{"subject": "Food", "text": "In a side booth at MacDonald's before your music class\nyou go up and down in your seat like an arpeggio\nunder the poster of the talking hamburger:\ntwo white eyes rolling around in the top bun, the thin\npatty of beef imitating the tongue of its animal nature.\nYou eat merrily. I watch the Oakland mommies,\ntrying to understand what it means to be \"single.\"\n\n*\n\nAcross from us, females of all ages surround the birthday girl.\nHer pale lace and insufficient being\ncan't keep them out of her circle.\nStripes of yellow and brown all over the place.\nThe poor in spirit have started to arrive,\nthe one with thick midwestern braids twisted like thought\non her head; usually she brings her mother.\nThis week, no mother. She mouths her words anyway\nacross the table, space-mama, time-mama,\nmama who should be there.\n\n*\n\nFamilies in line: imagine all this\ntranslated by the cry of time moving through us,\nthis place a rubble. The gardens new generations\nwill plant in this spot, and the food will go on\nin another order. This thought cheers me immensely.\nThat we will be there together, you still seven,\nbending over the crops pretending to be royalty,\nthat the huge woman with one blind eye\nand dots like eyes all over her dress\nwill also be there, eating with pleasure\nas she eats now, right up to the tissue paper,\npeeling it back like bright exotic petals.\n\n*\n\nLast year, on the sun-spilled deck in Marin\nwe ate grapes with the Russians;\nthe KGB man fingered them quickly and dutifully,\nthen, in a sad tone to us\n\"We must not eat them so fast,\nwe wait in line so long for these,\" he said.\n\n*\n\nThe sight of food going into a woman's mouth\nmade Byron sick. Food is a metaphor for existence.\nWhen Mr. Egotistical Sublime, eating the pasta,\npoked one finger into his mouth, he made a sound.\nFor some, the curve of the bell pepper\nseems sensual but it can worry you,\nthe slightly greasy feel of it.\n\n*\n\nThe place I went with your father had an apartment to the left, and in the window, twisted like a huge bowtie,\nan old print bedspread. One day, when I looked over,\nsomeone was watching us, a young girl.\nThe waiter had just brought the first thing:\nan orange with an avocado sliced up CCCC\nin an oil of forceful herbs. I couldn't eat it.\nThe girl's face stood for something\nand from it, a little mindless daylight was reflected.\nThe businessmen at the next table\nwere getting off on each other and the young chardonnay.\nTheir briefcases leaned against their ankles.\nI watched the young girl's face because for an instant\nI had seen your face there,\nunterrified, unhungry, and a little disdainful.\nThen the waiter brought the food,\nbands of black seared into it like the memory of a cage.\n\n*\n\nYou smile over your burger, chattering brightly.\nSo often, at our sunny kitchen table,\nhearing the mantra of the refrigerator,\nI've thought there was nothing I could do but feed you;\nand I've always loved the way you eat,\nyou eat selfishly, humming, bending\nthe french fries to your will, your brown eyes\nspotting everything: the tall boy\nwho has come in with his mother, repressed rage\nin espadrilles, and now carries the tray for her.\nOh this is fun, says the mother,\nYou stand there with mommy's purse.\nAnd he stands there smiling after her,\nholding all the patience in the world."}
