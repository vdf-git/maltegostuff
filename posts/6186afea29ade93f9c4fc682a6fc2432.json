{"subject": "As You Came From The Holy Land", "text": "As you came from the holy land\nOf Walsingham,\nMet you not with my true love\nBy the way as you came? \n\nHow shall I know your true love,\nThat have met many one,\nI went to the holy land,\nThat have come, that have gone? \n\nShe is neither white, nor brown,\nBut as the heavens fair; \nThere is none hath a form so divine\nIn the earth, or the air.\n\nSuch a one did I meet, good sir,\nSuch an angelic face,\nWho like a queen, like a nymph, did appear\nBy her gait, by her grace.\n\nShe hath left me here all alone,\nAll alone, as unknown,\nWho sometimes did me lead with herself,\nAnd me loved as her own.\n\nWhat's the cause that she leaves you alone,\nAnd a new way doth take,\nWho loved you once as her own,\nAnd her joy did you make? \n\nI have lov'd her all my youth; \nBut now old, as you see,\nLove likes not the falling fruit\nFrom the withered tree.\n\nKnow that Love is a careless child,\nAnd forgets promise past; \nHe is blind, he is deaf when he list,\nAnd in faith never fast.\n\nHis desire is a dureless content,\nAnd a trustless joy:\nHe is won with a world of despair,\nAnd is lost with a toy.\n\nOf womenkind such indeed is the love,\nOr the word love abus'd,\nUnder which many childish desires\nAnd conceits are excus'd.\n\nBut true love is a durable fire,\nIn the mind ever burning,\nNever sick, never old, never dead,\nFrom itself never turning."}
