{"subject": "Hayeswater", "text": "A region desolate and wild.\nBlack, chafing water: and afloat,\nAnd lonely as a truant child\nIn a waste wood, a single boat:\nNo mast, no sails are set thereon;\nIt moves, but never moveth on:\nAnd welters like a human thing\nAmid the wild waves weltering.\n\nBehind, a buried vale doth sleep,\nFar down the torrent cleaves its way:\nIn front the dumb rock rises steep,\nA fretted wall of blue and grey;\nOf shooting cliff and crumbled stone\nWith many a wild weed overgrown:\nAll else, black water: and afloat,\nOne rood from shore, that single boat."}
