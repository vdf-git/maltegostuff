{"subject": "Waiting For Rain", "text": "Finally, morning. This loneliness\nfeels more ordinary in the light, more like my face\nin the mirror. My daughter in the ER again. \nSomething she ate? Some freshener\nsomeone spritzed in the air? \nThey're trying to kill me, she says, \nas though it's a joke. Lucretius \ngot me through the night. He told me the world goes on\nmaking and unmaking. Maybe it's wrong\nto think of better and worse. \nThere's no one who can carry my fear\nfor a child who walks out the door\nnot knowing what will stop her breath. \nThe rain they say is coming\nsails now over the Pacific in purplish nimbus clouds. \nBut it isn't enough. Last year I watched\nelephants encircle their young, shuffling\ntheir massive legs without hurry, flaring\ntheir great dusty ears. Once they drank\nfrom the snowmelt of Kilimanjaro. \n\nNow the mountain is bald. Lucretius knows\nwe're just atoms combining and recombining: \nstar dust, flesh, grass. All night\nI plastered my body to Janet, \nbreathing when she breathed. But her skin, \nwarm as it is, does, after all, keep me out. \nHow tenuous it all is. \nMy daughter's coming home next week. \nShe'll bring the pink plaid suitcase we bought at Ross. \nWhen she points it out to the escort\npushing her wheelchair, it will be easy\nto spot on the carousel. I just want to touch her."}
