{"subject": "The Pines", "text": "You didn't listen to the beating of a tree's heart,\ncouched against the trunk gazing upwards,\nyou didn't see the leaves moving\nwith the throb of a heart,\nyou didn't feel the shudder\nof the swaying branches above your body,\nyou didn't listen to the heart of the pines\nwhen the wind moves them and those leaves\nthat are like green fragrant pins\nfall, and when the clouds pass,\nyou didn't see that the world was turning,\nthe entire world, and you didn't feel\nthat the sky was drawing near,\nwas entering inside the pines,\nand that you were disappearing, penetrating with it\ninside the pines, becoming in that sky another tree."}
