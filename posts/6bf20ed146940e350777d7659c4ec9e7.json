{"subject": "The Gift", "text": "What have we to give\nTo one who stands\nWaiting with open hands,\nMother of many sons in many lands?\nWho holds o'er land and main\nHer easeless, restless reign, -\nWho oft hath called her own, and ne'er hath called in vain.\n\nWhat is best to give\nWhen comes her call?\nCourage that fears no fall,\nAnd brave-eyed youth that dreadeth not at all;\nHearts strong on hope to cling, -\nHope for what years may bring,\nAnd service void of ease, and faith unquestioning.\n\nWhat hath she to give, -\nWhat last reward\nFor loyal heart and sword?\nWhat crown of victory, what princely hoard?\nHonour and strength and pride,\nAnd toil with joy allied, -\nGlory and hope and fame, for which her best have died."}
