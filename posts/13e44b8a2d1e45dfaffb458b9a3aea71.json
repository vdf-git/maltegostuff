{"subject": "Epilogue To The Tragedy Of Cato", "text": "You see in ancient Rome what folly reign'd; \nA folly British men would have disdain'd. \nHere's none so weak to pity Cato's case, \nWho might have liv'd, and had a handsome place; \nBut rashly vain, and insolently great, \nHe perish'd by his fault -- and not his fate. \nThank Heav'n! our patriots better ends pursue, \nWith something more than glory in their view. \nPoets write morals -- priests for martyrs preach -- \nNeither such fools to practice what they teach. \nThough your dear country much you wish to serve, \nFor bonny Britons 'tis too hard to starve; \nOr what's all one, to any generous mind, \n&gt;From girls, champagne, and gaming, be confin'd; \nPortius might well obey his sire's command, \nReturning to his small paternal land; \nA low estate was ample to support \nHis private life, far distant from the court! \nFar from the crowd of emulating beaux, \nWhere Martia never wanted birthday clothes. \nFor you, who live in these more polish'd days, \nTo spend your money, lo! ten thousand ways; \nDice may run ill, or duns demand their due, \nAnd ways to get (God knows) are very few; \nIn times so differing, who shall harshly blame \nOur modern heroes, not to act the same?"}
