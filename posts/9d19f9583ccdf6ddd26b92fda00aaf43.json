{"subject": "NOTTAWASAGA", "text": "Sky a motif of cowslip in clear ice,\n\nmayflies make moon-dials of the flagstones.\n\nOne hawk. Second hawk. They were up there\n\nearlier, as sand toads tacked from grass tuft to grass\n\ntuft, up the pressed dune's incline. Divots\n\nunder the pin oak.\n\nLake level's low. Unlike\n\nThis American Life's female executive producer's testosterone . . .\n\nE. coli trucked in\n\non lettuce, bocce lessons, pine beetle.\n\nThe shooter games vibrate in Balm Beach\n\nArcade so we squint, the better to look the part\n\nand later leak over The Guardian. Re-apply after bathing.\n\nContrail or cloud pattern? We're late arrivals, like winter.\n\nOne week, cedar fence to the waterline. Next,\n\na passion play of flip flops. Husqvarna. An arm splint."}
