{"subject": "Songs Of Gloom", "text": "IF the song I have to sing\nIs a dreary, gloomy thing,\nI would rather silent be;\nIf I cannot sing of cheer,\nI will never let you hear\nAny song of dole from me.\n\nLet no dirge escape my lips,\nRather song that gayly trips\nThan a slow and mournful tone;\nLet me sing a song of pleasure,\nIn a romping sort of measure,\nBut my woe I'll bear alone."}
