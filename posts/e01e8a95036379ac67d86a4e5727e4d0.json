In the\nthird hour, the beast awakes,\nin the fourth, waving\nof razorblades or axes becomes possible -\nin the fifth - tearful confessions,\nkissing of hands and feet.\nAt least one woman is indispensable\nso it doesn't all look so revolting.\n\nThis time, there was no lady,\nand it was the fifth hour.\n\nHe tries to read something\nin my palm.\n\nOh, he says, I can't even\ntell you the whole truth, y'know.\nSay it, I say.\n\n(I'm past caring, though I'm ready\nright now, for anything - thirty years old, because\nI'm ready because it's the fifth hour, because I have a right\nto the truth, because it's all the same to me).\n\nOh, he says, I don't even know\nhow to tell you, y'know.\nGive it to me straight, I say.\n\n(I don't give a damn, even now - cut veins\nor a bullet in the head - in my only-just thirty years\nbecause I'm wasted, because it's the fifth hour, because I want\nto know, however awful it might be).\n\nAt the third attempt, he tells me\nhis \u2018forty seven'. Ah - what relief!\nA whole seventeen years! What space!\nWhat transparency\non the horizons!\n\nI remember it as if it were yesterday:\naround three am\nthe whole gang bursts out into the fresh air\neverything drunk, no cigarettes left,\nstumbling, we cut through the darkness.\n\nThen suddenly something like this:\nI wipe my sweaty palm on the green grass, yes, exactly,\ngreen because it's the middle of April."}
