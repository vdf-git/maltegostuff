{"subject": "I Prefer the Golden Mean", "text": "Pity, says the Theban bard,\nFrom my wishes I discard; \nEnvy, let me rather be,\nRather far, a theme for thee.\nPity to distress is shown; \nEnvy to the great alone.\nSo the Theban. But to shine\nLess conspicuous be mine.\nI prefer the golden mean,\nPomp and penury between.\nFor alarm and peril wait\nEver on the loftiest state; \nAnd the lowest to the end\nObloquy and scorn attend.\n\ntranslated by William Cowper"}
