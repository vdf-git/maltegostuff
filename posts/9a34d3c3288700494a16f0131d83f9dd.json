{"subject": "Song - Say, Lovely Dream", "text": "Say, lovely dream, where couldst thou find\nShadows to counterfeit that face?\nColors of this glorious kind\nCome not from any mortal place.\n\nIn heaven itself thou sure wert drest\nWith that angel-like disguise;\nThus deluded am I blest,\nAnd see my joy with closed eyes.\n\nBut, ah, this image is too kind\nTo be other than a dream!\nCruel Sacharissa's mind\nNever put on that sweet extreme.\n\nFair dream, if thou intend'st me grace,\nChange that heavenly face of thine;\nPaint despised love in thy face,\nAnd make it to appear like mine.\n\nPale, wan, and meager let it look, \nWith a pity-moving shape,\nSuch as wander by the brook\nOf Lethe, or from graves escape.\n\nThen to that matchless nymph appear,\nIn whose shape thou shinest so, \nSoftly in her sleeping ear,\nWith humble words express my woe.\n\nPerhaps from greatness, state, and pride,\nThus surprised she may fall:\nSleep does disproportion hide,\nAnd, death resembling, equals all."}
