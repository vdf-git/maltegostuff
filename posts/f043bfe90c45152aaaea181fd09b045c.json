{"subject": "The Ten Poems Of Solitude VI", "text": "Perhaps my choice, my eternity \nThat lasts no longer than recommencing, \nThan banishing, petrifying of the roots. \nSometimes I look at you, sometimes at you. \nSometimes you fields are full, sometimes wrinkled, \nAnd while this year evaporates, I forfeit \nThe five bloody circles and elsewhere my love. \nLike a vista I forget the thumb-marked wall \nBehind which so many peepers glowed. \n\nYou defy the drumming days, the new night, \nCreated but tarnished by your chilly dress. \nYour skin becomes a clattering gown, a sojourn \nAmid the scents of grassy grounds. \nYour eyes shiver and shine, discolour my pity \nTo a shadow that fades what has gone. \nThat sinks and gives birth. And freezes. \n\nBut huntable, the hunt begins for you too \nExpressing seeing and hearing, inhabiting \nThe evil fog, time desperate and precise \nIn which flight becomes bold and superfluous \nThe digging, the stiffening and the peaceful bobbing \nAfter the estrangement, the cleansing of the needle. \nNo organ will play, no bow will protect you \nWhen the seedless abyss of pain \nCovers you beauty with splendour.\n\nTranslation Paul Vincent"}
