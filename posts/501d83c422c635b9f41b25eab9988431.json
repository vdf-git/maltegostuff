{"subject": "Fishing Song: To J.A. Froude And Tom Hughes", "text": "Oh, Mr. Froude, how wise and good,\nTo point us out this way to glory-\nThey're no great shakes, those Snowdon Lakes,\nAnd all their pounders myth and story.\nBlow Snowdon! What's Lake Gwynant to Killarney,\nOr spluttering Welsh to tender blarney, blarney, blarney?\n\nSo Thomas Hughes, sir, if you choose,\nI'll tell you where we think of going,\nTo swate and far o'er cliff and scar,\nHear horns of Elfland faintly blowing;\nBlow Snowdon! There's a hundred lakes to try in,\nAnd fresh caught salmon daily, frying, frying, frying.\n\nGeology and botany\nA hundred wonders shall diskiver,\nWe'll flog and troll in strid and hole,\nAnd skim the cream of lake and river,\nBlow Snowdon! give me Ireland for my pennies,\nHurrah! for salmon, grilse, and-Dennis, Dennis, Dennis!\nEversley, 1856."}
