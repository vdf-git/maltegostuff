{"subject": "Anniversary", "text": "It seems like only yesterday\n That our wedding date was set;\n Although it's been so many years,\n The memories linger yet.\n\n I guess that we've experienced life,\n In almost every form.\n We've enjoyed the greatest pleasures\n And weathered every storm,\n\n We've walked together side by side,\n As we traveled on through life;\n And I have always felt so proud,\n That you chose me for your wife.\n\n I wouldn't change my life with you,\n For any other way.\n We've reached another milestone, dear\n It's our Golden Wedding Day!\""}
