{"subject": "Concealment", "text": "No; to what purpose should I speak?\n      No, wretched heart! swell till you break.\n      She cannot love me if she would;\nAnd, to say truth, 'twere pity that she should.\n      No; to the grave thy sorrows bear;\n      As silent as they will be there:\nSince that lov'd hand this mortal wound does give,\n      So handsomely the thing contrive,\n      That she may guiltless of it live;\n      So perish, that her killing thee\nMay a chance-medley,and no murder, be.\n\n      'Tis nobler much for me, that I\n      By her beauty, not her anger, die:\n      This will look justly, and become\nAn execution; that, a martyrdom.\n      The censuring world will ne'er refrain\n      From judging men by thunder slain.\nShe must be angry, sure, if I should be\n      So bold to ask her to make me,\n      By being hers, happier than she!\n      I will not; 't is a milder fate\nTo fall by her not loving, than her hate.\n\n      And yet this death of mine, I fear,\n      Will ominous to her appear;\n      When, sound in every other part,\nHer sacrifice is found without an heart;\n      For the last tempest of my death\n      Shall sigh out that too with my breath.\nThen shall the world my noble ruin see,\n      Some pity and some envy me;\n      Then she herself, the mighty she,\n      Shall grace my funerals with this truth;\n' 'T was only Love destroy'd the gentle youth.'"}
