{"subject": "To The Same Robin On Beginning His Song", "text": "SIT at my table, welcome guest, and sing\nThe olden song, with young unpractised throat;\nI hold my breath to hear the perfect note\nThy tender organs cannot yet make ring.\nSing to me, unpaired fledgling of the spring,\nSing, solace me, as if I were thy mate;\nTeach me fond patience as I sit and wait,\nBrooding quick thoughts with unprogressive wing.\n\nThy song is faint as breath of unblown flowers,\nAnd only that it shakes thy budding breast,\nI could have deemed it homeless; as I hear it,\nWith lowered eyelids and suspended powers,\nI, too, from doubt, and toil, and strain find rest,\nAnd, Spirit! seem to hear thee in the spirit."}
