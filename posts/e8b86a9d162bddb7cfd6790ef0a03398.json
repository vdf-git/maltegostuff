{"subject": "The Wild Old Wicked Man", "text": "BECAUSE I am mad about women\nI am mad about the hills,'\nSaid that wild old wicked man\nWho travels where God wills.\n'Not to die on the straw at home.\nThose hands to close these eyes,\nThat is all I ask, my dear,\nFrom the old man in the skies.\nDaybreak and a candle-end.\n\n'Kind are all your words, my dear,\nDo not the rest withhold.\nWho can know the year, my dear,\nwhen an old man's blood grows cold? '\nI have what no young man can have\nBecause he loves too much.\nWords I have that can pierce the heart,\nBut what can he do but touch?'\nDaybreak and a candle-end.\n\nThen Said she to that wild old man,\nHis stout stick under his hand,\n'Love to give or to withhold\nIs not at my command.\nI gave it all to an older man:\nThat old man in the skies.\nHands that are busy with His beads\nCan never close those eyes.'\nDaybreak and a candle-end.\n\n'Go your ways, O go your ways,\nI choose another mark,\nGirls down on the seashore\nWho understand the dark;\nBawdy talk for the fishermen;\nA dance for the fisher-lads;\nWhen dark hangs upon the water\nThey turn down their beds.\nDaybreak and a candle-end.\n\n'A young man in the dark am I,\nBut a wild old man in the light,\nThat can make a cat laugh, or\nCan touch by mother wit\nThings hid in their marrow-bones\nFrom time long passed away,\nHid from all those warty lads\nThat by their bodies lay.\nDayhreak and a candle-end.\n\n'All men live in suffering,\nI know as few can know,\nWhether they take the upper road\nOr stay content on the low,\nRower bent in his row-boat\nOr weaver bent at his loom,\nHorseman erect upon horseback\nOr child hid in the womb.\nDaybreak and a candlc-cnd.\n\n'That some stream of lightning\nFrom the old man in the skies\nCan burn out that suffering\nNo right-taught man denies.\nBut a coarse old man am I,\nI choose the second-best,\nI forget it all awhile\nUpon a woman's breast.'\nDaybreak and a candlc-end."}
