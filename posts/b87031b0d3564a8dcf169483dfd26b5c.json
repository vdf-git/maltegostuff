He doesn't look over the top\nof his newspaper.\nI glance around, hoping that Miss July\nwith her sassy fife will distract me,\nbut his calendars\nfeature only a vernal wrench, saucy\ntiming belt, naked carburetor:\nthings that might make a robot humid.\nSitting across from his headlines, I feel\nlike the mechanic's wife: virtues ignored,\nfaults magnified, taken for granted . . .\nIt's all I can do to not clutch\nthe lapels of my robe and run into\nthe bathroom weeping.\nFinally he listens. Intently. Leaning closer,\none hand on my trembling manifold."}
