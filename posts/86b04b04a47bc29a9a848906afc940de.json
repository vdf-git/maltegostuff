{"subject": "Hats", "text": "Auntie lies in the rest home with a feeding tube and a bedpan, she\nweighs nothing, she fidgets and shakes, and all I can see are her\nknotted hands and the carbon facets of her eyes, she was famous for her\npies and her kindness to neighbors, but if it is true that every hat\nexhibits a drama the psyche wishes it could perform, what was my aunt\nsaying all the years of my childhood when she squeezed into cars with\nthose too tall hats, those pineapples and colored cockades, my aunt who\ntold me I should travel slowly or I would see too much before I died,\nwore spires and steeples, tulled toques. The velvet inkpots of\nSchiaparelli, the mousseline de soie of Lilly Dach\u00e9 have\ndisappeared into the world, leaving behind one flesh-colored box, Worth\nstenciled on the top, a coral velvet cloche inside with matching veil\nand drawstring bag, and what am I to make of these Dolores del Rio size\n4 black satin wedgies with constellations of spangles on the bridge.\nBefore she climbed into the white boat of the nursing home and sailed\naway--talking every day to family in heaven, calling them through the\nsprinkling system--my aunt said she was pushing her cart through the\ngrocery when she saw young girls at the end of an aisle pointing at her,\nher dowager's hump, her familial tremors. Auntie, who claimed that\nninety pounds was her fighting weight, carried her head high, hooded,\nturbaned, jeweled, her neck straight under pounds of roots and\nvegetables that shimmied when she walked. Surely this is not the place\nof women in our world, that when we are old and curled like crustaceans,\nyoung girls will laugh at us, point their fingers, run as fast as they\ncan in the opposite direction."}
