{"subject": "Miners", "text": "There was a whispering in my hearth,\nA sigh of the coal.\nGrown wistful of a former earth\nIt might recall.\n\nI listened for a tale of leaves\nAnd smothered ferns,\nFrond-forests; and the low, sly lives\nBefore the fawns.\n\nMy fire might show steam-phantoms simmer\nFrom Time's old cauldron,\nBefore the birds made nests in summer,\nOr men had children.\n\nBut the coals were murmuring of their mine,\nAnd moans down there\nOf boys that slept wry sleep, and men\nWrithing for air.\n\nAnd I saw white bones in the cinder-shard,\nBones without number.\nFor many hearts with coal are charred,\nAnd few remember.\n\nI thought of all that worked dark pits\nOf war, and died\nDigging the rock where Death reputes\nPeace lies indeed.\n\nComforted years will sit soft-chaired\nIn rooms of amber;\nThe years will stretch their hands, well-cheered\nBy our lifes' ember.\n\nThe centuries will burn rich loads\nWith which we groaned,\nWhose warmth shall lull their dreaming lids,\nWhile songs are crooned.\nBut they will not dream of us poor lads\nLeft in the ground."}
