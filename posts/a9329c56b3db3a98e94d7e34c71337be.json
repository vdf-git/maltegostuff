{"subject": "Laus Infantium", "text": "In praise of little children I will say \nGod first made man, then found a better way \nFor woman, but his third way was the best. \nOf all created things, the loveliest \nAnd most divine are children. Nothing here \nCan be to us more gracious or more dear. \nAnd though, when God saw all his works were good, \nThere was no rosy flower of babyhood, \n\u2019T was said of children in a later day \nThat none could enter Heaven save such as they. \n\nThe earth, which feels the flowering of a thorn, \nWas glad, O little child, when you were born; \nThe earth, which thrills when skylarks scale the blue, \nSoared up itself to God\u2019s own Heaven in you; \n\nAnd Heaven, which loves to lean down and to glass \nIts beauty in each dewdrop on the grass,\u2014 \nHeaven laughed to find your face so pure and fair, \nAnd left, O little child, its reflex there."}
