{"subject": "The Idler\u2019s Calendar.  Twelve Sonnets For The Months.  September -", "text": "FEAST OF ST. PARTRIDGE\n\nThe only saint in all our calendar\nIs good St. Partridge. 'Tis his feast to--day,\nThe happiest day of all a happy year,\nAnd heralded as never yet was May.\nThe dawn has found us marshalled for the fray,\nStriding the close--shorn stubbles ranked in line,\nWith lust of battle and with lust of play\nMade glorious drunk as men are drunk with wine.\n\nThere go the coveys, forward birds and strong,\nBound for the mangold where they wheel and stop.\nNow, steady, men, and bring the left along.\nA fortune waits us in each turnip--top.\nWith a wild shriek, and then a whirr of wings,\nThe covey rises. Brace and brace they drop,\nJoining the dead ranks of forgotten things\nIn glorious death, the fierce delight of kings."}
