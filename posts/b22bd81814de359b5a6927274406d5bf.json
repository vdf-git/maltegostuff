Extempore In The Court Of Session", "text": "LORD ADVOCATEHE clenched his pamphlet in his fist,\nHe quoted and he hinted,\nTill, in a declamation-mist,\nHis argument he tint it:\nHe gap\u00e8d for't, he grap\u00e8d for't,\nHe fand it was awa, man;\nBut what his common sense came short,\nHe eked out wi' law, man.\nMR. ERSKINECollected, Harry stood awee,\nThen open'd out his arm, man;\nHis Lordship sat wi' ruefu' e'e,\nAnd ey'd the gathering storm, man:\nLike wind-driven hail it did assail'\nOr torrents owre a lin, man:\nThe BENCH sae wise, lift up their eyes,\nHalf-wauken'd wi' the din, man."}
