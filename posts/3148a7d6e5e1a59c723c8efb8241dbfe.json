{"subject": "The Question", "text": "1916\nBrethren, how shall it fare with me\nWhen the war is laid aside,\nIf it be proven that I am he\nFor whom a world has died?\n\nIf it be proven that all my good,\nAnd the greater good I will make,\nWere purchased me by a multitude\nWho suffered for my sake?\n\nThat I was delivered by mere mankind\nVowed to one sacrifice,\nAnd not, as I hold them, battle-blind,\nBut dying with open eyes?\n\nThat they did not ask me to draw the sword\nWhen they stood to endure their lot --\nThat they only looked to me for a word,\nAnd I answered I knew them not?\n\nIf it be found, when the battle clears,\nTheir death has set me free,\nThen how shall I live with myself through the years\nWhich they have bought for me?\n\nBrethren, how must it fare with me,\nOr how am I justified,\nIf it be proven that I am he\nFor whom mankind has died --\nIf it be proven that I am he\nWho, being questioned, denied?"}
