{"subject": "The Old Gate Made Of Pickets", "text": "There was moonlight in the garden and the chirr and chirp of crickets;\nThere was scent of pink and peony and deep syringa thickets,\nWhen adown the pathway whitely, where the firefly glimmered brightly,\nShe came stepping, oh, so lightly,\nTo the old gate made of pickets.\n\nII.\n\nThere were dew and musk and murmur and a voice that hummed odd snatches\nOf a song while there she hurried, through the moonlight's silvery patches,\nTo the rose-grown gate, above her and her softly-singing lover,\nWith its blossom-tangled cover\nAnd its weight and wooden latches.\n\nIII.\n\nWhom she met there, whom she kissed there, mid the moonlight and the roses,\nWith his arms who there enclosed her, as a tiger-lily encloses\nSome white moth that frailly settles on its gold and crimson petals,\nWhere the garden runs to nettles,\nNo one knows now or supposes.\n\nIV.\n\nYears have passed since that last meeting; loves have come and loves departed:\nStill the garden blooms unchanging; there is nothing broken-hearted\nIn its beauty, where the hours lounge with sun and moon and showers,\nMid the perfume and the flowers\nAs in days when those two parted.\n\nV.\n\nYet the garden and the flowers and the cheerily chirring crickets,\nAnd the moonlight and the fragrance, and the wind that waves the thickets,\nThey remember what was spoken, and the rose that was a token,\nAnd the gentle heart there broken\nBy the old gate made of pickets."}
