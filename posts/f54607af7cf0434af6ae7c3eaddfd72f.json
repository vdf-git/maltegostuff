{"subject": "Space is My Mistress", "text": "Space is my Mistress,\nand she beckons my return.\nSince our departure I think of you\nand yearn to fly across the heavens arm in arm.\nI marvel at your figure,\ndefined by the edges of continents.\nYou gaze at me with turquoise eyes,\nperhaps mistaken for ocean atolls.\nYou tease me to fall into your bosom,\nsculptured by tectonic rifts,\nonly to move away as if playing some tantalizing game.\nTime and time we turn together,\nthrough day, and night, and day,\nrepeating encounters every 90 minutes with a freshness,\nas if we have never seen our faces before.\nWe stroll outside together,\nenveloped by naked cosmos,\nfilled with desire to be one.\nSo close,\nyou sense my every breath,\nwhich masks your stare through visor haze.\nWe dance on the swirls of cloud tops,\nwhile skirting the islands of blue.\nYou know my heart beats fast for you.\nOh, Space is my mistress,\nand when our orbits coincide,\nwe will once again make streaks of aurora across the sky."}
