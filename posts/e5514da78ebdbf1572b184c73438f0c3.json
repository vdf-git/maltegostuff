{"subject": "The Call", "text": "I must be off where the green boughs beckon\u2014\nWhy should I linger to barter and reckon?\nThe mart may pay me\u2014the mart may cheat me,\nI have had enough of the huckster's din,\nThe calm of the deep woods waits to greet me,\n(Heart of the high hills, take me in.)\n\nI must be off where the brooks are waking,\nWhere birds are building and green leaves breaking.\nWhy should the hold of an old task bind me?\nI know of an eyrie I fain would win\nWhere a wind of the West shall seek me and find me,\n(Heart of my high hills, take me in.)\n\nI must be off where the stars are nearer,\nWhere feet go swifter and eyes see clearer,\nLittle I heed what the toilers name me\u2014\nI have heard the call that to miss were sin,\nThe April voices that clamour and claim me,\n(Heart of my high hills, take me in.)"}
