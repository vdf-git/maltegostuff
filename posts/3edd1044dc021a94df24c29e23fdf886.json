{"subject": "The River", "text": "I\n\nAs drones a bee with sultry hum\nWhen all the world with heat lies dumb,\nThou dronest through the drows\u00e8d lea,\nTo lose thyself and find the sea.\n\nAs fares the soul that threads the gloom\nToward an unseen goal of doom,\nThou farest forth all witlessly,\nTo lose thyself and find the sea.\n\nII\n\nMy soul is such a stream as thou,\nLapsing along it heeds not how;\nIn one thing only unlike thee,-\nLosing itself, it finds no sea.\n\nAlbeit I know a day shall come\nWhen its dull waters will be dumb;\nAnd then this river-soul of Me,\nLosing itself, shall find the sea."}
