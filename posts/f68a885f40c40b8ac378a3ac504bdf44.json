{"subject": "Only Thee", "text": "That I want thee, only thee---let my heart repeat without end. \nAll desires that distract me, day and night, \nare false and empty to the core. \n\nAs the night keeps hidden in its gloom the petition for light, \neven thus in the depth of my unconsciousness rings the cry \n---'I want thee, only thee'. \n\nAs the storm still seeks its end in peace \nwhen it strikes against peace with all its might, \neven thus my rebellion strikes against thy love \nand still its cry is \n---'I want thee, only thee'."}
