Over here, in 'Our' land, I am\nMuslim immigrant, nomenclature with grave\n\nallusions: unemployment, anger, and\nunpredictable police attention. Over there\n\nI was an 'apostate', principal's term for\nthe boy who failed Koran Studies and wrote\n\nan essay on Leonardo da Vinci. Over here\ndainty high school girl rejected this thick\n\naccented adolescent for being too hairy\nand a 'Muslim rapist'. Over there, utterly guilty\n\nof doodling Zorro; hence flogged by the irate\nprincipal. Over here shackled to a passport\n\netched with 'born in Tehran'. There I was\nsuspected of perfidy to the Faith, an Infidel-\n\nwannabe. Over here I am suspected\nof terror, 'Our' values' covert enemy. My likes\n\naren't to belong to tribes, nations, et al; but\nwelcome at the cells of the Islamic Republic's\n\nEvin Prison, pliers pinching their finger-\nnails; or sleep-deprived and hooded indefinitely\n\nin the dark solitaries of Guant\u00e1namo Bay."}
