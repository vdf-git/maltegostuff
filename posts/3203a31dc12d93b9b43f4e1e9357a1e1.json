{"subject": "To Touch His Hand", "text": "I have seen many men as they lay and die \nSat with the tortured mind and humble soul, \nI have dances with the devil under moonlight sky, \nOn the wide wide fields and mountains of life. I have worn the white coat of what is right \nWithout one thought of what might be wrong, \nDreaming of the moment my heart would be set free \nAnd leave the path of hate pain has brought to me. Now as the last years of life release my pride \nI feel no pain as my soul must cry out, \nNow I search for love and the welcome hand \nAnd pray that peace might touch every man. In the wind swept space where eagles fly \nSome day up there I know I will find \nHigh among the stars and burning blue \nThe face of my God, and touch his hand."}
