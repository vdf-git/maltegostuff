{"subject": "The Cottager's Welcome.", "text": "Hard by I've a cottage that stands near the wood--\nA stream glides in peace at the door--\nWhere all who will tarry, 'tis well understood,\nReceive hospitality's store.\nTo cheer that the brook and the thicket afford,\nThe stranger we ever invite:\nYou're welcome to freely partake at the board,\nAnd afterwards rest for the night.\n\nThe birds in the morning will sing from the trees,\nAnd herald the young god of day;\nThen, with him uprising, depart if you please--\nWe'll set you refreshed on the way:\nYou're coin for our service we sternly reject;\nNo traffic for gain we pursue,\nAnd all the reward that we wish or expect\nWe take in the good that we do.\n\nMankind are all pilgrims on life's weary road,\nAnd many would wander astray\nIn seeking Eternity's silent abode,\nDid Mercy not point out the way!\nIf all would their duty discharge as they should\nTo those who are friendless and poor,\nThe world would resemble my cot near the wood,\nAnd life the sweet stream at my door."}
