{"subject": "Of His Ladies Old Age", "text": "When you are very old, at evening\n\nYou\u2019ll sit and spin beside the fire, and say,\n\nHumming my songs, \u2018Ah well, ah well-a-day!\n\nWhen I was young, of me did Ronsard sing.\u2019\n\nNone of your maidens that doth hear the thing,\n\nAlbeit with her weary task foredone,\n\nBut wakens at my name, and calls you one\n\nBlest, to be held in long remembering.\n\nI shall be low beneath the earth, and laid\n\nOn sleep, a phantom in the myrtle shade,\n\nWhile you beside the fire, a grandame grey,\n\nMy love, your pride, remember and regret;\n\nAh, love me, love! we may be happy yet,\n\nAnd gather roses, while \u2019tis called to-day."}
