{"subject": "Apple Blossoms", "text": "I sit in the shadow of apple-boughs,\nIn the fragrant orchard close,\nAnd around me floats the scented air,\nWith its wave-like tidal flows.\nI close my eyes in a dreamy bliss,\nAnd call no king my peer;\nFor is not this the rare, sweet time,\nThe blossoming time of the year?\n\nI lie on a couch of downy grass,\nWith delicate blossoms strewn,\nAnd I feel the throb of Nature's heart\nResponsive to my own.\nOh, the world is fair, and God is good,\nThat maketh life so dear;\nFor is not this the rare, sweet time,\nThe blossoming time of the year? \n\nI can see, through the rifts of the apple-boughs,\nThe delicate blue of the sky, \nAnd the changing clouds with their marvellous tints\nThat drift so lazily by.\nAnd strange, sweet thoughts sing through my brain,\nAnd Heaven, it seemeth near;\nOh, is it not a rare, sweet time,\nThe blossoming time of the year?"}
