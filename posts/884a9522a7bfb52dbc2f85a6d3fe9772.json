{"subject": "When First You Saw the Nymph Divine", "text": "Cleonicus, unhappy man,\nSay whence thy sorrows first began?\nFor, by yon' blazing orb of light,\nI ne'er beheld so sad a sight.\nWhere hast thou been? thy flesh is gone,\nAnd nothing left but skin and bone.\nMy d\u00e6mon sure and hapless fate,\nReduc'd thee to this wretched state;\nEusithea stole thy heart, like mine;\nWhen first you saw the nymph divine,\nYou gaz'd on her with wishful eyes,\nAnd hence, I fear, your woes arise."}
