{"subject": "The Fugitive. (Tartar Song, From The Prose Version Of Chodzko)", "text": "I.\n'He is gone to the desert land \nI can see the shining mane \nOf his horse on the distant plain, \nAs he rides with his Kossak band! \n\n'Come back, rebellious one! \nLet thy proud heart relent; \nCome back to my tall, white tent, \nCome back, my only son! \n\n'Thy hand in freedom shall \nCast thy hawks, when morning breaks, \nOn the swans of the Seven Lakes, \nOn the lakes of Karajal. \n\n'I will give thee leave to stray \nAnd pasture thy hunting steeds \nIn the long grass and the reeds \nOf the meadows of Karaday. \n\n'I will give thee my coat of mail, \nOf softest leather made, \nWith choicest steel inlaid; \nWill not all this prevail?'\n\nII.\n\n'This hand no longer shall \nCast my hawks, when morning breaks, \nOn the swans of the Seven Lakes, \nOn the lakes of Karajal. \n\n'I will no longer stray \nAnd pasture my hunting steeds \nIn the long grass and the reeds \nOf the meadows of Karaday. \n\n'Though thou give me thy coat of mall, \nOf softest leather made, \nWith choicest steel inlaid, \nAll this cannot prevail. \n\n'What right hast thou, O Khan, \nTo me, who am mine own, \nWho am slave to God alone, \nAnd not to any man? \n\n'God will appoint the day \nWhen I again shall be \nBy the blue, shallow sea, \nWhere the steel-bright sturgeons play. \n\n'God, who doth care for me, \nIn the barren wilderness, \nOn unknown hills, no less \nWill my companion be. \n\n'When I wander lonely and lost \nIn the wind; when I watch at night \nLike a hungry wolf, and am white \nAnd covered with hoar-frost; \n\n'Yea, wheresoever I be, \nIn the yellow desert sands, \nIn mountains or unknown lands, \nAllah will care for me!' \n\nIII.\n\nThen Sobra, the old, old man,-- \nThree hundred and sixty years \nHad he lived in this land of tears, \nBowed down and said, 'O Khan! \n\n'If you bid me, I will speak. \nThere's no sap in dry grass, \nNo marrow in dry bones! Alas, \nThe mind of old men is weak! \n\n'I am old, I am very old: \nI have seen the primeval man, \nI have seen the great Gengis Khan, \nArrayed in his robes of gold. \n\n'What I say to you is the truth; \nAnd I say to you, O Khan, \nPursue not the star-white man, \nPursue not the beautiful youth. \n\n'Him the Almighty made, \nAnd brought him forth of the light, \nAt the verge and end of the night, \nWhen men on the mountain prayed. \n\n'He was born at the break of day, \nWhen abroad the angels walk; \nHe hath listened to their talk, \nAnd he knoweth what they say. \n\n'Gifted with Allah's grace, \nLike the moon of Ramazan \nWhen it shines in the skies, O Khan, \nIs the light of his beautiful face. \n\n'When first on earth he trod, \nThe first words that he said \nWere these, as he stood and prayed, \nThere is no God but God! \n\n'And he shall be king of men, \nFor Allah hath heard his prayer, \nAnd the Archangel in the air, \nGabriel, hath said, Amen!'"}
