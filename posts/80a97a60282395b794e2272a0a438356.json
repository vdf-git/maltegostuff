{"subject": "Not My City", "text": "This isn't the kind of city,\nOnce I called my own.\nThe city belongs to foxy politicians,\nUnscrupulous traders, flesh racketeers, pimps, loompens, rapists,\nBut this cannot be my city.\n\nThe city belongs to mute witnesses,\nTo rape and murder but not to me,\nThe city belongs to hypocrites,\nFeigning nonchalance to the sight of destitute,\nAt slums and beggars dying on the avenues of the rich.\nThis is the city of the escapists,\nWho at the slightest premonition of a peril,\nMake the hastiest retreat.\nThis is the city of the spooks\nThey stoically sit on the piles of injustice; \nHere they go into rhapsodies,\nOver the question of life after death.\nThis is the city of the soothsayers,\nAgents of self-aggrandizement, opportunists.\nI can never call it my own city, never.\nLiars, cheats, religious bigots abound in here; \nIn this city, we're a handful of men and women\nArmed with logic, liberal thoughts,\nVoice against injustice,\nLive in beating hearts.\nNot my City."}
