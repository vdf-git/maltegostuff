{"subject": "A Celebration Of Charis: I. His Excuse For Loving", "text": "Let it not your wonder move,\nLess your laughter, that I love.\nThough I now write fifty years,\nI have had, and have, my peers;\nPoets, though divine, are men,\nSome have lov'd as old again.\nAnd it is not always face,\nClothes, or fortune, gives the grace;\nOr the feature, or the youth.\nBut the language and the truth,\nWith the ardour and the passion,\nGives the lover weight and fashion.\nIf you then will read the story,\nFirst prepare you to be sorry\nThat you never knew till now\nEither whom to love or how;\nBut be glad, as soon with me,\nWhen you know that this is she\nOf whose beauty it was sung;\nShe shall make the old man young,\nKeep the middle age at stay,\nAnd let nothing high decay,\nTill she be the reason why\nAll the world for love may die."}
