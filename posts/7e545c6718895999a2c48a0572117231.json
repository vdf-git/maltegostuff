{"subject": "Propertius's Bid For Immortality", "text": "Horace: Book III, Ode 3\n\n\"Carminis interea nostri red\u00e6mus in orbem---\"\nLet us return, then, for a time, \nTo our accustomed round of rhyme; \nAnd let my songs' familiar art \nNot fail to move my lady's heart.\n\nThey say that Orpheus with his lute \nHad power to tame the wildest brute; \nThat \"Vatiations on a Theme\" \nOf his would stay the swiftest stream.\n\nThey say that by the minstrel's song \nCith\u00e6ron's rocks were moved along \nTo Thebes, where, as you may recall, \nThey formed themselves to frame a wall.\n\nAnd Galatea, lovely maid, \nBeneath wild Etna's fastness stayed \nHer horses, dripping with the mere, \nThose Polypheman songs to hear.\n\nWhat marvel, then, since Bacchus and \nApollo grasp me by the hand, \nThat all the maidens you have heard \nShould hang upon my slightest word?\n\nT\u00e6nerian columns in my home \nAre not; nor any golden dome; \nNo parks have I, nor Marcian spring, \nNor orchards--nay, nor anything.\n\nThe Muses, though, are friends of mine; \nSome readers love my lyric line; \nAnd never is Callipoe \nAwearied by my poetry.\n\nO happy she whose meed of praise \nHath fallen upon my sheaf of lays! \nAnd every song of mine is sent \nTo be thy beauty's monument.\n\nThe Pyramids that point the sky, \nThe House of Jove that soars so high, \nMausolus' tomb--they are not free \nFrom Death his final penalty.\n\nFor fire or rain shall steal away \nThe crumbling glory of their day; \nBut fame for wit can never die, \nAnd gosh! I was a gay old guy!"}
