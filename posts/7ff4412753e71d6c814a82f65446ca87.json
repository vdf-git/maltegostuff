{"subject": "My Father Was A Farmer: A Ballad", "text": "MY father was a farmer upon the Carrick border, O,\nAnd carefully he bred me in decency and order, O;\nHe bade me act a manly part, though I had ne'er a farthing, O;\nFor without an honest manly heart, no man was worth regarding, O.\nThen out into the world my course I did determine, O;\nTho' to be rich was not my wish, yet to be great was charming, O;\nMy talents they were not the worst, nor yet my education, O:\nResolv'd was I at least to try to mend my situation, O.\nIn many a way, and vain essay, I courted Fortune's favour, O;\nSome cause unseen still stept between, to frustrate each endeavour, O;\nSometimes by foes I was o'erpower'd, sometimes by friends forsaken, O;\nAnd when my hope was at the top, I still was worst mistaken, O.\nThen sore harass'd and tir'd at last, with Fortune's vain delusion, O,\nI dropt my schemes, like idle dreams, and came to this conclusion, O;\nThe past was bad, and the future hid, its good or ill untried, O;\nBut the present hour was in my pow'r, and so I would enjoy it, O.\nNo help, nor hope, nor view had I, nor person to befriend me, O;\nSo I must toil, and sweat, and moil, and labour to sustain me, O;\nTo plough and sow, to reap and mow, my father bred me early, O;\nFor one, he said, to labour bred, was a match for Fortune fairly, O.\nThus all obscure, unknown, and poor, thro' life I'm doom'd to wander, O,\nTill down my weary bones I lay in everlasting slumber, O:\nNo view nor care, but shun whate'er might breed me pain or sorrow, O;\nI live to-day as well's I may, regardless of to-morrow, O.\nBut cheerful still, I am as well as a monarch in his palace, O,\nTho' Fortune's frown still hunts me down, with all her wonted malice, O:\nI make indeed my daily bread, but ne'er can make it farther, O:\nBut as daily bread is all I need, I do not much regard her, O.\nWhen sometimes by my labour, I earn a little money, O,\nSome unforeseen misfortune comes gen'rally upon me, O;\nMischance, mistake, or by neglect, or my goodnatur'd folly, O:\nBut come what will, I've sworn it still, I'll ne'er be melancholy, O.\nAll you who follow wealth and power with unremitting ardour, O,\nThe more in this you look for bliss, you leave your view the farther, O:\nHad you the wealth Potosi boasts, or nations to adore you, O,\nA cheerful honest-hearted clown I will prefer before you, O."}
