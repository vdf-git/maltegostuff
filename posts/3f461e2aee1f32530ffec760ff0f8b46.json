{"subject": "Stella", "text": "Flap, flap went the mind of the bird\nWho flew out of my grandmother's attic\nLike heat in the creases\nWhere air used to be.One week\nOf summer was all that house\nCould take of my brother and me.\n\n\t\t\tYears later,\nAfter she died, someone, my aunt I\nThink, arranged for her to be driven\nBack to Kingfisher, Oklahoma for the\nFuneral.It was raining, the mortician\nHadn't arrived yet, so the driver\nLeft her there --\n\nMy grandmother, unembalmed, in darkness,\n\nIn the month of the Green Corn Ceremony.\nBut she wasn't Cherokee, she hated Indians.\nHer story was only deep, irregular\nWing-beats of the heart.\n\nDown dropped a huge bright-colored\nNight-bird with large crested head,\nWhich, when raised, gave\nThe appearance of being startled.\n\nIt skimmed a few puddles gorging\nOn insects and a lizard or two.\nThen banked south for my\nGrandmother's house, bright star."}
