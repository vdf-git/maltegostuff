{"subject": "Nara Nog", "text": "Rank growth of grass, and columns overthrown,\nBlack pools of rain, and icy storm-swept heights\nTitanic fragments of hewn stone,\nFrowning forests drear and dark as night's\nUnnamed unholy rites:\n\nScurrying cloud-wrack, wind and wail and woe,\nRuinous fanes of gods forgotten long,\nRushing river and trackless snow\nOn crag and peak and precipice, and the strong\nRoar of the cataract's song:\n\nWind, storm, and rain, rain, snow, and stormy wind,\nThese with their tempest-wing\u00e9d might o'erthrew- \nWhile the avalanche howled behind- \nYon shattered monstrous forms, that once were You,\nShrines once a godhead knew.\n\nThese overthrew. But who upreared and how?- \nWhat magic music or what royal rod\nBuilt you- whose desolate courts now\nOnly by prowling forest-beasts are trod- \nIn what dead world, to what dead god?"}
