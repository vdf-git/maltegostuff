{"subject": "Benevolent Assimilation", "text": "We haven't the appearance, goodness knows,\nOf plain commercial men; \nFrom a hasty glance, you might suppose \nWe are fractious now and then. \nBut though we come in warlike guise \nAnd battle-front arrayed, \nIt's all a business enterprise \u2014 \nWe're seeking foreign trade.\n\nWe want to assimilate, if we can,\nOur brother who is brown; \nWe love our dusky fellow-man\nAnd we hate to hunt him Sown. \nSo, when we perforate his frame, \nWe want him to be good. \nWe shoot at him to make him tame, \nIf he but understood.\n\nREFRAIN\n\nWe're as mild as any turtle-dove\nWhen we see the foe a-coming, \nOur thoughts are set on human love\nWhen we hear the bullets humming.\nWe teach the native population \nWhat the golden rule is like, \nAnd we scatter public education \nOn ev'ry blasted hike!"}
