{"subject": "To Ellen Terry", "text": "Nay, bring forth none but daughters: daughters young,\nThe doubles of yourself; with face as fair,\nBearing as candid, gait as debonair,\nAnd voice as deeply, musically strung:\nThat the less fortunate age, from this age sprung,\nIn those transmitted gleams of what you were,\nMay hear your laughter, gaze on your despair,\nAnd all but know the witchery of your tongue.\nThus shall the unsteadfast dagger of Macbeth\nBe nerved by his male spouse; thus Shylock's knife,\nGlittering to smite, be dulled by Portia's breath;\nThus saucy Beatrice be won for life,\nJuliet in loving warble out her life,\nAnd true Ophelia madden unto death."}
