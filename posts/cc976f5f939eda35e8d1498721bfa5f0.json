{"subject": "Domestic Happiness", "text": "I.\n'BESIDE the nuptial curtain bright'\nThe Bard of Eden sings,\n'Young Love his constant lamp will light,\n'And wave his purple wings.'\nBut rain-drops from the clouds of care\nMay bid that lamp be dim,\nAnd the boy Love will pout and swear\n'Tis then no place for him.\n\nII\nSo mused the lovely Mrs. Dash;\n'Tis wrong to mention names;\nWhen for her surly husband's cash\nShe urged in vain her claims.\nI want a little money, dear,\n'For Vandervoort and Flandin,\nTheir bill, which now has run a year,\nTo-morrow mean to hand in.'\n\nIII\n'More?' cried the husband, half asleep,\n'You'll drive me to despair;'\nThe lady was too proud to weep,\nAnd too polite to swear.\nShe bit her lip for very spite,\nHe felt a storm was brewing,\nAnd dreamed of nothing else all night\nBut brokers, banks, and ruin.\n\nIV\nHe thought her pretty once, but dreams\nHave sure a wondrous power,\nFor to his eye the lady seems\nQuite altered since that hour\u2014\nAnd Love, who on their bridal eve,\nHad promised long to stay,\nForgot his promise\u2014took French leave\u2014\nAnd bore his lamp away."}
