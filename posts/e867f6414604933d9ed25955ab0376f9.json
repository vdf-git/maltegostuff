{"subject": "Vignette - Vi", "text": "THE LOVER'S APOLOGY.\nI look'd into her eyes,\nAnd saw something divine,\nFor there, like summer lightning,\nSwift coruscations shine.\n\nStill flashing, and still changing,\nAttemper'd soft and bright,\nThrough each expression ranging,\nFrom pity to delight.\n\nFrom high or zealous feeling,\nFrom arch, excursive grace,\nFrom all with which a lovely mind\nEndows the human face.\n\nPerhaps a new and careless eye\nMay not those beauties see,\nAnd wonder to behold the power\nBelinda has with me.\n\nThe spell which holds this captive soul\nShe never would possess,\nWere not her varying features rul'd\nBy sparkling playfulness,\n\nBut when with aimless, trackless skill\nIs twin'd a mazy chain,\nIn the warm foldings of a heart,\nPerforce it must remain."}
