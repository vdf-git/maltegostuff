{"subject": "Two of the Furies", "text": "The old woman in the parking lot\nwields her walker not unspryly. Gray hair\nlank and without style, hanging\nunder her ski hat, as I wear a ski hat\u2014\nher legs bare under her skirt,\nmy legs bare under my skirt,\nshe wears sneakers, I wear sneakers\u2014\nwindbreaker, windbreaker. She rolls up\nto watch me board, as people do,\nbecause it is interesting\nto see the wheelchair maneuvered backward\ninto the van. You got it?\nshe asks, as people do\nthough I am not their child.\nWe are not sisters either,\ndespite the wind's ruffling our skirts in sync\u2014\noh how she is interested in the ruffling of my skirt.\nThe ruffle makes her giddy, starts\nher bald gums racing on their wordless observations\nas she peers into my thighs.\nHow alike we are! says this\nno-sister of mine to be argued with,\njust some crazy old woman\nflashing the terrible crater of her smile\nto raise the wind and\nprove her point."}
