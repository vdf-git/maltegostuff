{"subject": "Siberian Spring", "text": "I\n\nMulticolored wings begin to flutter\nOver taiga wilderness in wind.\nAnd a melted mirror springs and shudders\nOver miles, where green seams Just begin.\nSnows sing a farewell, a wet, gray chain,\nWings and mirrors full of hues and sound.\nWith the lion's roaring of the rain\nFlares the childish wish to run unbound,\nCatching up with all wild streams he misses,\nFlying like a bird, he'd soar away:\nOver people, forests, rocks, abysses \u2014\nTo the new, the shining festive day!\n\nII\n\nShimmering in bright green, the Irtysh\nPolishes its metal on the stone.\nWants to find again its waves, its fish,\nFor again the floes of ice are flown\u2026\nAnd instead of looking dark and grave\nThrough its only eye, a sawn-out wheel \u2014\nIt observes through every tiny wave\nHow the world is spinning in a reel\nRound the sun that, daring, from its perch,\nHurls its swords, and now it licks the sweet,\nSparkling ice-shine of a budding birch\nAs a child licks eagerly a treat."}
