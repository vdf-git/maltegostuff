{"subject": "The Guinea Pig And The Green Balloon", "text": "I approached the luminous stranger who came to me\nfrom darkness in a gown of lettuce leaves, in a velvet\n\ncloak of green that appeared at first another piece of dark,\nbut pulled apart into the glow-sphere that danced\n\nin swaying steps, the lucent majesty that slipped toward me\nfrom the reigning silence black above my cage.\n\nOh extravagant\u2014and were my teeth too sharp to greet\nor sharp enough? I do not understand now what was meant\n\nto happen and what was a mistake\u2014but know the bursting,\nthe sickening snap of ecstasy wrenched back to the body\n\nand the green gown flung in crippled circles traced\nlike diagrams of wasting moons above my head\u2014or portals\n\nto another world, I thought, but as I thought, the shriek\ndissolved, the body crumpled from the air and landed\n\non its side beneath the salt lick. All night I tended\nthe wasted skin and careful, brought it water,\n\nalfalfa, made a bed of cedar chips and tried to gather\nmolecules of breath that floated from the plant shelf.\n\nWhen I remembered morning, I began to cry, began to pray\nfor night to stay until the green took shape again\n\nand if that shape were gone, I prayed for night\nto stay, to be held in the same forever-dark\n\nin which I first looked up and saw the gentle body,\nand saw the graceful swaying of the stranger coming\n\nas if for me\u2014now I do not know\u2014but then,\nas if for me, and all my loneliness gone."}
