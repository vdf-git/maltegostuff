{"subject": "When The Shadow Of Doubt", "text": "I was tattered and torn, when Jesus found me, \n slowly fading away, heartbroken and desolate, \n I fell to my knees to pray.\n Now... when the shadow of doubt is cast upon me, \n when I become a stranger in my own land,\n \"I'll persevere and follow my savior, for I know now, time is at hand\".\n When stones of judgement, are cast upon me, by those who practice to deceive, \n \"Oh yes my heart has grown weary, Oh yes my heart has grieved\",...still \n When the shadow of doubt, is cast upon me, when I become a stranger in my own land, \n \"I'll persevere, and follow my savior, for I know now, time is at hand\".\n One Lord, one faith, one baptism, \"I and my father are one\",\n The birth, the death, the resurrection, an invitation to salvation, for everyone!"}
