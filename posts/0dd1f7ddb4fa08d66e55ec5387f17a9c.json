{"subject": "Lost Love", "text": "His eyes are quickened so with grief, \nHe can watch a grass or leaf \nEvery instant grow; he can \nClearly through a flint wall see, \nOr watch the startled spirit flee \nFrom the throat of a dead man. \nAcross two counties he can hear \nAnd catch your words before you speak. \nThe woodlouse or the maggot's weak \nClamour rings in his sad ear, \nAnd noise so slight it would surpass \nCredence--drinking sound of grass, \nWorm talk, clashing jaws of moth \nChumbling holes in cloth; \nThe groan of ants who undertake \nGigantic loads for honour's sake \n(Their sinews creak, their breath comes thin); \nWhir of spiders when they spin, \nAnd minute whispering, mumbling, sighs \nOf idle grubs and flies. \nThis man is quickened so with grief, \nHe wanders god-like or like thief \nInside and out, below, above, \nWithout relief seeking lost love."}
