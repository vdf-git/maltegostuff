{"subject": "I Am That Creature", "text": "I am that creature and creator who\nLoosens and reins the waters of the sea,\nForming the rocky marge anon anew.\nI stir the cold breasts of antiquity,\nAnd in the soft stone of the pyramid\nMove wormlike; and I flutter all those sands\nWhereunder lost and soundless time is hid.\nI shape the hills and valleys with these hands,\nAnd darken forests on their naked sides,\nAnd call the rivers from the vexing springs,\nAnd lead the blind winds into deserts strange.\nAnd in firm human bones the ill that hides\nIs mine, the fear that cries, the hope that sings.\nI am that creature and creator, Change."}
