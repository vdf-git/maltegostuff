{"subject": "Seeming Failure", "text": "O wave upon the strand!\nWhat urges thee in vain\nTo lift the baffled hand\nIn suppliance again?\n'The passion that impels\nThe tidal energies\nIn every bud that swells,\nIn every soul that sighs:\n'The same that on the cross\nSustained the dying Christ,\nWhen Love for seeming Loss\nAlone was sacrificed.'"}
