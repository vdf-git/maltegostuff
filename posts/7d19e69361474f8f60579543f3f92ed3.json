{"subject": "The Kindly Neighbor", "text": "I have a kindly neighbor, one who stands\nBeside my gate and chats with me awhile,\nGives me the glory of his radiant smile\nAnd comes at times to help with willing hands.\nNo station high or rank this man commands,\nHe, too, must trudge, as I, the long day's mile;\nAnd yet, devoid of pomp or gaudy style,\nHe has a worth exceeding stocks or lands.\nTo him I go when sorrow's at my door,\nOn him I lean when burdens come my way,\nTogether oft we talk our trials o'er\nAnd there is warmth in each good-night we say.\nA kindly neighbor! Wars and strife shall end\nWhen man has made the man next door his friend."}
