{"subject": "I Don'T Need A Babysitter!", "text": "(This is a fictional poem) \n\nWhen it comes to my parents, I'm still angry and bitter.\nI'm a thirty-six year old man and they still hire babysitters.\nThe babysitters treat me like a child and they suffer my wrath.\nThey tuck me in at night and they even give me baths.\nThey won't let me watch TV and I have to go to bed at seven o clock.\nTonight my babysitter had to get stitches when I hit her in the head with a rock.\nThe babysitter just quit and she kicked my dad in the balls before she left.\nI want to be treated like an adult and if they hire another babysitter, I'm going to hold my breath."}
