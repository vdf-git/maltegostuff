{"subject": "The Wooden Toy", "text": "1\n\nThe brightly-painted horse\nHad a boy's face,\nAnd four small wheels\nUnder his feet,\n\nPlus a long string\nTo pull him by this way and that\nAcross the floor,\nShould you care to.\n\nA string in-waiting\nThat slipped away\nIn many wiles\nFrom each and every try.\n\n\t2\n\nKnock and they'll answer,\nMother told me.\n\nSo I climbed four flights of stairs\nAnd went in unannounced.\n\nAnd found a small wooden toy\nFor the taking\n\nIn the ensuing emptiness\nAnd the fading daylight\n\nThat still gives me a shudder\nAs if I held the key to mysteries in my hand.\n\n\t3\n\nWhere's the Lost and Found Department,\nAnd the quiet entry,\nThe undeveloped film\nOf the few clear moments\nOf our blurred lives?\n\nWhere's the drop of blood\nAnd the teeny nail\nThat pricked my finger\nAs I bent down to touch the toy\n\nAnd caught its eye?\n\n\t4\n\nEvening light,\n\nMake me a Sunday\nGo-to meeting shadow\nFor my toy.\n\nMy dearest memories are\nSteep stair-wells\nIn dusty buildings\nOn dead-end streets,\n\nWhere I talk to the walls\nAnd closed doors\nAs if they understood me.\n\n\t5\n\nThe wooden toy sitting pretty.\n\nNo, quieter than that.\n\nLike the sound of eyebrows\nRaised by a villain\nIn a silent movie.\n\nPsst, someone said behind my back.\n\n---------------------------- --------\nPoetry\nVolume CLXXI, Number 1\nEighty-Fifth Anniversary\nSpecial Double Issue\nOctober-November 1997"}
