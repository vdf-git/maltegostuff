The ancient ritual \nwas to recite the pious hymns \nhundred one times.\n\nA goddess mocks \nthe mortal to go dreamer\u2015 for \nthe moon which never stops smiling.\n\nWhat was the dream \nof huddled thoughts, when \nlight comes through a small window.\n\nHow far the Viola has \nfallen? The landing pad \nwill not receive\u2015 \nthe fugitive guest."}
