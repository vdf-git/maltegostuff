{"subject": "The Experience Of All Men", "text": "MINE eyes are grown too dim with tears to gaze \nInto the future with that eager eye \nWhich, in the fulness of my young amaze \nAt this fair earth and various harmony, \nI bent on all things, hoping to descry \nA parallel in spirit; but I found \nSuch grief and desolation all around, \nAnd the air fill'd with such a mournful cry \nOf human tones, that I shook off my dream, \nAnd comfortless arose. And then God spake-- \nHave I not given thee work wherein shall be\nA life's joy and abiding-place for thee?\nTime to thine eyes a fairy vision brake,\nTime does but perfect every noble aim."}
