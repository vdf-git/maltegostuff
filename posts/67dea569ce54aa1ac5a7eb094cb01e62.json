{"subject": "To His Friend", "text": "If thou wilt shun the pricking briers,\nAnd thornie cares that folly breedes,\nPut bridle to thy fond desires,\nMake reason mistres of thy deedes.\nAttempt nothing by rash aduice,\nIf thou thus doe, then art thou wise.\nWhere Wit to Will is slaue and thrall,\nWhere fond affection beareth sway,\nTen thousand mischiefes do befall:\nAnd vertue cleane is cast away,\nFor hauing rashnes for their guide,\nSuch cannot choose but wander wyde.\nTheir credite quickly lies in dust,\nWhich yeelde as bondslaues to their will,\nAnd follow euery foolish lust,\nSuch leaue the good, and choose the yll,\nThe wayes of vertue those forgoe,\nAnd tread the pathes of care and woe.\nWilt thou possesse eternall ioyes,\nAnd porte of blisse at length attayne?\nStill prayse the Lord with heart and voyce,\nFrom doyng yll thy steppes refrayne.\nThese things obserude, be sure at last,\nIn heauen with Christ, thou shalt be plast."}
