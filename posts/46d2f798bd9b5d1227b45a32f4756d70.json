{"subject": "The Crocus", "text": "Beneath the sunny autumn sky,\nWith gold leaves dropping round,\nWe sought, my little friend and I,\nThe consecrated ground,\nWhere, calm beneath the holy cross,\nO'ershadowed by sweet skies,\nSleeps tranquilly that youthful form,\nThose blue unclouded eyes.\n\nAround the soft, green swelling mound\nWe scooped the earth away,\nAnd buried deep the crocus-bulbs\nAgainst a coming day.\n'These roots are dry, and brown, and sere;\nWhy plant them here?' he said,\n'To leave them, all the winter long,\nSo desolate and dead.'\n\n'Dear child, within each sere dead form\nThere sleeps a living flower,\nAnd angel-like it shall arise\nIn spring's returning hour.'\nAh, deeper down \u2014 cold, dark, and chill \u2014\nWe buried our heart's flower,\nBut angel-like shall he arise\nIn spring's immortal hour.\n\nIn blue and yellow from its grave\nSprings up the crocus fair,\nAnd God shall raise those bright blue eyes,\nThose sunny waves of hair.\nNot for a fading summer's morn,\nNot for a fleeting hour,\nBut for an endless age of bliss,\nShall rise our heart's dear flower."}
