{"subject": "The Poet's Love-Song", "text": "In noon-tide hours, O Love, secure and strong, \nI need thee not; mad dreams are mine to bind\nThe world to my desire, and hold the wind\nA voiceless captive to my conquering song.\nI need thee not, I am content with these:\nKeep silence in thy soul, beyond the seas!\n\nBut in the desolate hour of midnight, when\nAn ectasy of starry silence sleeps \nAnd my soul hungers for thy voice, O then,\nLove, like the magic of wild melodies,\nLet thy soul answer mine across the seas."}
