{"subject": "To My Sister", "text": "Fain would I be to thee, my sister sweet, \nLike the bright cloud beneath Aurora's feet \nA pedestal to help thee mount on high \nInto the blessed peace of the blue sky. \n\nThe zephyr would I be, to which is given \nTo waft the rose's fragrance up to heaven, \nThat thy pure soul, amid life's stress and strain, \nMight not exhale its perfume sweet in vain. \n\nFain would I be to thee as crystal dew \nOf morn, that doth the young flower's sap renew. \nAnd with its vapour veils her from the sun, \nLest thy fresh heart be seared ere day is done. \n\nFain would I be to thee a nightingale, \nTelling within thine ear so sweet a tale; \nNo meaner strain thine eyes with sleep should dim. \nAnd thou shouldst wake to hear a sacred hymn. \n\nFain would I be to thee a broad-armed tree \nThat casts wide shadow on the sultry lea, \nAnd cheers from far the wandering traveller's view; \nSo would my love shed o'er thee shade and dew. \n\nFain would I be to thee a refuge sure, \nAs 'neath the thatch the swallow builds secure. \nA humble roof, it yet the rain can ward; \nSo I from storms thine innocence would guard. \n\nAh! when to thee this world, as yet unknown, \nIts barren hopes, its bitterness hath shown, \nFain, fain would I bring comfort in that hour \nTo thy sad heart. Oh, would I had the power!"}
