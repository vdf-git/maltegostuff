{"subject": "Sonnet Xiii", "text": "IN that proud port, which her so goodly graceth,\nwhiles her faire face she reares vp to the skie:\nand to the ground her eie lids low embaseth,\nmost goodly temperature ye may descry,\nMyld humblesse mixt with awfull maiesty,\nfor looking on the earth whence she was borne:\nher minde remembreth her mortalitie,\nwhat so is fayrest shall to earth returne.\nBut that same lofty countenance seemes to scorne\nbase thing, &amp; thinke how she to heauen may clime:\ntreading downe earth as lothsome and forlorne,\nthat hinders heauenly thoughts with drossy slime.\nYet lowly still vouchsafe to looke on me,\nsuch lowlinesse shall make you lofty be."}
