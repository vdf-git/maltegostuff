{"subject": "A Letter To My Sister", "text": "Allene, sweet sister, with the blood\nOf youth yet coursing through your cheeks,\nI was informed, not long ago,\nThat you had quit attending school.\nWhat is the cause that you should act\nSo rashly as to stop your search\nThrough that enormous library\nPiled up by Time in ages past\nAnd guarded with unceasing care\nBy fond Existence? I wish that\nYou might know the full value of\nAn education. I think you\nWould reconsider soon your act\nAnd turn again toward the path\nOf learning, and would never cease\nTo delve into the depths of things\nUnthought by others. I suppose,\nThough, that you have considered all\nThis thoroughly, and have resolved\nThat 'tis as well for you to stop.\nYet, I cannot but think that you\nHave acted wrongly. Surely you\nWill in some future year regret\nThat you have thought it wise and well\nTo discontinue the pursuit\nOf knowledge. I should you advise\nTo get all education that\nCan well be stored within your brain;\nFor nothing that you learn will be\nOf any disadvantage to\nYou through the life that is to last\nUntil your death. If you have learned\nTo deeply think upon the things\nBrought up in daily studies, 'twill\nHelp you to think more thoroughly\nInto the cares of daily life;\nNo matter what their size or weight.\nI was surprised, indeed, and sad\nTo hear you had determined thus\nTo forfeit your good chance to be\nIn future time a person of\nGreat wealth in wit and lore of books.\nSince I was taken out of school\nI've often wished that I might find\nAn opportunity to go\nTo school again. I'd like to have\nA college course of quite four years,\nWhich I intend some day to get,\nE'en though I may be then some years\nA senior o'er my present age.\nWhen you and Lilian had begun\nTo study music, you recall\nThe fact that you cared naught for it,\nWhile Lilian studied much and learned\nQuite readily to play: so well\nThat afterwards you were inspired\nWith full desire to be equipped\nTo play as well as she? Forthwith\nYou then began to practice much\nAnd study more than you at first\nDid care to; so that now you have\nSucceeded quite in learning well\nTo chant the strains of sweetness deep\nAnd melody upon the keys\nOf the piano, bringing forth\nThe deep expressions, beauties and\nThe symphonies of art and life.\nSo, in the years when Lilian\nHas graduated from her class\nAt high school, and equipped herself\nWith lore of books, you will regret\nThat you did not advantage take\nOf time, then past, by draining all\nThe books in reach of their great wealth\nOf countless treasures, precious gems,\nAnd hiding them away within\nYour chest of memory, to use\nAt times when they are needed most.\nTherefore, I'd be much pleased if you\nWould continue your term of school\nAnd finish honorably and well."}
