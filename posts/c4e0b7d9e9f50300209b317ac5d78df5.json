{"subject": "Two Are Together", "text": "Two are together, I tell you,\nA slope of a vowel, are a corner;\nGrass short as a garden,\nBracken\nUncoiling,\nFoxgloves, water\nDescending,\nQuartz in a stone.\n\nThis corner:\nMountain-ash (ferns\nUp in air).\nThen over an edge\nThis single\nBlue wedge of a mountain;\nThis comfort, you tell me,\nContentment,\nCompassion.\n\nThis wild-mint-scented scene\nAnd wild roses\nAnd wrinkle of water descending\nTending to laughter;\nTogether, then\nAfter."}
