{"subject": "The Suns And The Void", "text": "Upon the stark, blue blankness of the sky,\nThe assailing armies of the stars have swept,\nAnd all the night is splendid with their spears.\nThe azure emptiness hath grown a page,\nInscribed with countless characters of flame -\nGigantic hieroglyphs inscrutable,\nEmblazonry eternal of the dark,\nAnd ciphers bright whose key is yet unfound,\nThat burn as riddles to unnumbered eyes\nOn worlds uncountable.\n\nThe earth rolls on\nWithin its shadow - darkness that lays bare\nThe sister worlds, and legions of the suns\nThat flame remote, as day to unseen spheres,\nAnd gleaming atoms on the night to us.\nEnormous revelation of the dark!\nThe finite looks upon Infinity,\nThe endless star-processions that unfold\nOn midnight roads of the unceasing void.\nO suns, thy light doth blind and stun the soul!\nThe imponderable abyss is as a weight\n\nTo crush the spirit utterly! I feel,\nMore strong than thunder on the astounded ear,\nThe vast, stupendous silence of the gulf.\nIts darkness wraps me round, and I am lost,\nAll sense of self o'erwhelmed, and my soul steeped\nIn night, till it becomes a darkness, too.\nWhat suns beyond the suns, what further voids\nThe night doth hide! What skies unseen are bright\nTo dwellers in Polaris' worlds! What depths\nOf black, abysmal silence fall unsunned\nPast Fomalhaut!"}
