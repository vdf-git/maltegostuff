{"subject": "Like Undistinguishable Horses", "text": "Like undistinguishable horses,\nGleam by my ever-painful days, \nAs if fade all the living roses,\nAnd die all living nightingales.\n\nBut she is, too, upset and saddened, \nMy single governess \u2013 my love,\nAnd under her skin of a satin,\nThe poisoned blood is now moved.\n\nAnd if I stand the world I live in,\nThat is because I have a dream:\nBoth of us, like two blind children,\nWill go to the highland\u2019s rims, \n\nWhere clouds are so white and close,\nWhere only goats run the dales,\nTo seek forever faded roses,\nAnd hark to lifeless nightingales."}
