{"subject": "At Tynemouth Priory", "text": "AFTER A TEMPESTUOUS VOYAGE.\n\nAs slow I climb the cliff's ascending side,\nMuch musing on the track of terror past,\nWhen o'er the dark wave rode the howling blast,\nPleased I look back, and view the tranquil tide\nThat laves the pebbled shore: and now the beam\nOf evening smiles on the gray battlement,\nAnd yon forsaken tower that time has rent:--\nThe lifted oar far off with transient gleam\nIs touched, and hushed is all the billowy deep!\nSoothed by the scene, thus on tired Nature's breast\nA stillness slowly steals, and kindred rest;\nWhile sea-sounds lull her, as she sinks to sleep,\nLike melodies that mourn upon the lyre,\nWaked by the breeze, and, as they mourn, expire!"}
