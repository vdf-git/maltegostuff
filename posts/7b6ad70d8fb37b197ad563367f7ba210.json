{"subject": "Candles", "text": "Light these candles.\nRise, light these candles.\nThere will remain,\nThese quarrelsome winds,\nBut you should light these candles.\n\nMay darkness not think the moon scared.\nMay night not think the sun dead.\nLight these lamps to honor life.\nRise, light these candles.\n\nGranted, the night's reign may be stubborn,\nBut rays of light still survive.\nOn dark pages, verses revealing life.\nRise, light these candles.\n\nThese cruel whirlwinds will remain,\nThe fall will shake away the leaves,\nBut this does not mean that new leaves will not grow.\nRise, light these candles.\n\nUnafraid of the poison that spreads daily in the wind,\nNature continues to do its duty,\nOf transforming poison into nectar.\nRise, light these candles.\n\nGirls, do not cry, this is the time of Rahiras.\nDo not linger on death, reflect upon the passage of time.\nThese difficulties will pass away.\nRise, light these candles."}
