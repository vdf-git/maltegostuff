{"subject": "Verse For A Certain Dog", "text": "Such glorious faith as fills your limpid eyes,\nDear little friend of mine, I never knew.\nAll-innocent are you, and yet all-wise.\n(For Heaven's sake, stop worrying that shoe!)\nYou look about, and all you see is fair;\nThis mighty globe was made for you alone.\nOf all the thunderous ages, you're the heir.\n(Get off the pillow with that dirty bone!)\n\nA skeptic world you face with steady gaze;\nHigh in young pride you hold your noble head,\nGayly you meet the rush of roaring days.\n(Must you eat puppy biscuit on the bed?)\nLancelike your courage, gleaming swift and strong,\nYours the white rapture of a winged soul,\nYours is a spirit like a Mayday song.\n(God help you, if you break the goldfish bowl!)\n\n\"Whatever is, is good\" - your gracious creed.\nYou wear your joy of living like a crown.\nLove lights your simplest act, your every deed.\n(Drop it, I tell you- put that kitten down!)\nYou are God's kindliest gift of all - a friend.\nYour shining loyalty unflecked by doubt,\nYou ask but leave to follow to the end.\n(Couldn't you wait until I took you out?)"}
