He replied: \"Veziers are like physicians and the latter give medicine to the sick only but, as I perceive that your opinions are in conformity with propriety, I have nothing to say about them.\"\n\n          When an affair succeeds without my idle talk  \n          It is not meet for me to speak thereon.  \n          But if I see a blind man near a well  \n          It is a crime for me to remain silent."}
