See the old 'un! \nWhy, his dinnerplates are golden! \nMay the sight our hearts embolden \nIn our prayer. \nAh, dismiss them, with a 'blessing;' \nAll intoning and confessing; \nNever more our souls distressing \nWith their cant! \nHelp to silence priestly mumble, \nHelp the Mammontemples tumble, \nFreedom's banner o'er the jumble \nFirm to plant. \nCome, dear toilers, stained and weary, \nCome and help the world grow cheery, \nCome from out your prison dreary \nBuilt by greed; \nYou who labour heavyladen, \nSlaving mother, trampled maiden, \nEver preached to, every preyed on, \nIn your need; \nLet your winters grow no colder, \nRise at last and dare be bolder, \nSetting shoulder firm to shoulder \nFor a thrust! \nYokes be eased, and burdens lighter, \nAs the great Hope warms the fighter, \nAnd the broad New Day grows brighter \nAnd more just."}
