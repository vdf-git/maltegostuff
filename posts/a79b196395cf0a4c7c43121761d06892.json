{"subject": "Enchantment", "text": "The deep seclusion of this forest path, -\nO'er which the green boughs weave a canopy;\nAlong which bluet and anemone\nSpread dim a carpet; where the Twilight hath\nHer cool abode; and, sweet as aftermath,\nWood-fragrance roams, - has so enchanted me,\nThat yonder blossoming bramble seems to be\nA Sylvan resting, rosy from her bath:\nHas so enspelled me with tradition's dreams,\nThat every foam-white stream that, twinkling, flows,\nAnd every bird that flutters wings of tan,\nOr warbles hidden, to my fancy seems\nA Naiad dancing to a Faun who blows\nWild woodland music on the pipes of Pan."}
