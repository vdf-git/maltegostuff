{"subject": "Father's Day", "text": "My daughter has lived overseas for a number\nof years now. She married into royalty, and they\nwon't let her communicate with any of her family or\nfriends. She lives on birdseed and a few sips\nof water. She dreams of me constantly. Her husband,\nthe Prince, whips her when he catches her dreaming.\nFierce guard dogs won't let her out of their sight.\nI hired a detective, but he was killed trying to\nrescue her. I have written hundreds of letters\nto the State Department. They have written back\nsaying that they are aware of the situation. I\nnever saw her dance. I was always at some\nconvention. I never saw her sing. I was always\nworking late. I called her My Princess, to make\nup for my shortcomings, and she never forgave me.\nBirdseed was her middle name."}
