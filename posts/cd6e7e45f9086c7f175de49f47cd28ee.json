{"subject": "Sand", "text": "So many grains, so many little tombs\nof dust. It keeps us humble: the deceased,\nalways slightly larger than their time,\nlarger than us, no less, just as a breeze\n\nis larger than the cloud that blows it. More\nstars in the sky than granules on the shore.\nI believe that, as I believe no one here\nwould count it out, counting on it rather\n\nthe way the sand counts on a gravity\nto pull it, to drain the thread, its current\nto the earth. So many grains, so many\nfriends now gone the way of the moment,\n\nof the age that bore them, the one they bore.\nWhich is to see our past as large, blessed\nto have such giants in it, such wind to bear\ntheir loss, to stretch our sails like blown glass."}
