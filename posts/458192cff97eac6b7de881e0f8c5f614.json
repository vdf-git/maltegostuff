{"subject": "Necessitas--Vis--Libertas!", "text": "A tall, bony old woman, with iron face and dull, fixed look, moves with\nlong strides, and, with an arm dry as a stick, pushes before her another\nwoman.\n\nThis woman--of huge stature, powerful, thick-set, with the muscles of a\nHercules, with a tiny head set on a bull neck, and blind--in her turn\npushes before her a small, thin girl.\n\nThis girl alone has eyes that see; she resists, turns round, lifts fair,\ndelicate hands; her face, full of life, shows impatience and daring.... She\nwants not to obey, she wants not to go, where they are driving her ... but,\nstill, she has to yield and go.\n\n_Necessitas--Vis--Libertas_!\n\nWho will, may translate."}
