{"subject": "Ancestors", "text": "They stand in front of the big fenders\nAnd headlights, bulbous chrome grille\nWith Indian chief hood ornament\nWhich lights up in the dark.\n\nIn the background is a magnolia tree\nAnd part of a house, a clothesline strung\nAcross gray space; a black and white\nBulldog sits at their feet\n\nMaking its smudged face of teeth.\nEach thing is in its place:\nNothing worried about their eyes,\nNo problem with belief.\n\nThey're confident about the truth,\nSporting short fat ties\nWith gold watch chains hanging from vests\nOf white, baggy suits\u2014\n\nYet nothing says they're aloof or braggart.\nThings are in their places:\nThe dime cigars they hold spoofing; spats\nShined\u2014parts known by heart.\n\nThe women are inside the house\nFinishing the chicken;\nThe thin one married to the son\nStill dreams of being a nurse,\n\nAnd doesn't talk much to the other\nWho married again for fun.\nAt church they sang and took communion\nThis bright, airy Easter,\n\nAnd now they'll go for a ride in the country,\nAnd eat chicken under\nSome big oak at the edge of a pasture,\nAnd everything will be\n\n\"Pretty as a picture,\" set\nWith only a cloud or two\nDrifting across a spotless sky,\nEveryone forgets . . .\n\nThe lean years behind; the children\nGrowing up strong, knowing\nRight from wrong; and business booming\u2014\nA time sweet as Eden:\n\nThe fields of wheat like a table run\nSmooth and green to the horizon;\nAnd the cows graze painted\nInto the blue air and sun.\n\nThe Kodak clicks, and they sigh out\nBreath, joking, ready\nTo go, as the women emerge from the dark\nScreen door in big hats,\n\nWith picnic basket, mocking a gesture\nOf impatience; the engine starts,\nDresses are smoothed and doors shut\u2014\nNo one knows who took the picture."}
