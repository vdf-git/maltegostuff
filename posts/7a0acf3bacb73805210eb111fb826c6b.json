{"subject": "Flirtation", "text": "UPON thy purple mat thy body bare \nIs fine and limber like a tender tree. \nThe motion of thy supple form is rare, \nLike a lithe panther lolling languidly, \nToying and turning slowly in her lair. \nOh, I would never ask for more of thee, \nThou art so clean in passion and so fair. \nEnough! if thou wilt ask no more of me!"}
