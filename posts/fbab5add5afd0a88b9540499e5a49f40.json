{"subject": "The Supreme Sacrifice", "text": "Well-nigh two thousand years hath Israel \nSuffered the scorn of man for love of God; \nEndured the outlaw's ban, the yoke, the rod, \nWith perfect patience. Empires rose and fell, \nAround him Nebo was adored and Bel; \nEdom was drunk with victory, and trod \nOn his high places, while the sacred sod \nWas desecrated by the infidel. \nHis faith proved steadfast, without breach or flaw, \nBut now the last renouncement is required. \nHis truth prevails, his God is God, his Law \nIs found the wisdom most to be desired. \nNot his the glory! He, maligned, misknown, \nBows his meek head, and says, \"Thy will be done!\""}
