{"subject": "Fitzmickle Unbends", "text": "Mr Fitzmickle, the martinet,\nStill with an iron hand\nRules house and home.  Like a peevish gnome\nHe barks each curt command.\nAnd he packs the family off to bed \nSince a wireless 'fan' he's grown \nAnd each obeys, while Papa stays\nAnd harks to the Test alone.\n\nMr Fitzmickle, the martinet,\nSat, last Saturday night,\nGlowing with pride as Australia's side\nRose to the loftiest height.\nThen, just as the fun grew furious\nAnd the batsmen forged ahead,\nCame a horrible shriek, a click and a squeak;\nAnd the speaker went stone dead!\n\nMr Fitzmickle, the martinet,\nFiddled, with urgent thumb,\nAt many a screw, in a terrible stew;\nBut ever the set stayed dumb.\nSo up the stairs in his stocking feet,\nHe stole to his small son there,\nWhose expert hand now took command;\nAnd the Test was again on the air.\n\nMr Fitzmickle, the martinet,\nFrowned at his small, meek heir.\n'You'll wait,' said he, 'lest the thing won't gee.\nQuiet, sir!  Sit over there!'\nAnd his small son; hugging himself in glee\nAs the game went merrily on\nSat listening in with a rapturous grin\nTo the triumphs of 'Billy' and 'Don.'\n\nMr Fitzmickle, the martinet,\nSeized with a strange wild joy,\nAs the centuries came, with his eye aflame,\nClutched at the startled boy . . . .\nAnd Mrs Fitzmickle, roused from sleep,\nSaw a sight to wonder at;\nFitzmickle and son, at half-past one,\nDancing a jig on the mat.\n\nMr Fitzmickle, the martinet,\nSaid with a sheepish grin,\n'Why, Mother's here!  Sit down, my dear,\nSit down and listen in!' . . . \nAnd the small son whispered - when all was o'er,\nAnd the winter dawn began \nIn his mother's ear: 'Ma, ain't it queer.\nPappas's just like a man!'"}
