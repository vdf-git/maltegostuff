{"subject": "Sir Lark And King Sun", "text": "'Good morrow, my lord!' in the sky alone\nSang the lark as the sun ascended his throne.\n'Shine on me, my lord: I only am come,\nOf all your servants, to welcome you home!\nI have shot straight up, a whole hour, I swear,\nTo catch the first gleam of your golden hair.'\n\n'Must I thank you then,' said the king, 'sir Lark,\nFor flying so high and hating the dark?\nYou ask a full cup for half a thirst:\nHalf was love of me, half love to be first.\nSome of my subjects serve better my taste:\nTheir watching and waiting means more than your haste.'\n\nKing Sun wrapt his head in a turban of cloud;\nSir Lark stopped singing, quite vexed and cowed;\nBut higher he flew, for he thought, 'Anon\nThe wrath of the king will be over and gone;\nAnd, scattering his head-gear manifold,\nHe will change my brown feathers to a glory of gold!'\n\nHe flew, with the strength of a lark he flew,\nBut as he rose the cloud rose too;\nAnd not one gleam of the flashing hair\nBrought signal of favour across the air;\nAnd his wings felt withered and worn and old,\nFor their feathers had had no chrism of gold.\n\nOutwearied at length, and throbbing sore,\nThe strong sun-seeker could do no more;\nHe faltered and sank, then dropped like a stone\nBeside his nest, where, patient, alone,\nSat his little wife on her little eggs,\nKeeping them warm with wings and legs.\n\nDid I say alone? Ah, no such thing!\nThere was the cloudless, the ray-crowned king!\n'Welcome, sir Lark!-You look tired!' said he;\n'\nUp\nis not always the best way to me:\nWhile you have been racing my turban gray,\nI have been shining where you would not stay!'\n\nHe had set a coronet round the nest;\nIts radiance foamed on the wife's little breast;\nAnd so glorious was she in russet gold\nThat sir Lark for wonder and awe grew cold;\nHe popped his head under her wing, and lay\nAs still as a stone till king Sun went away."}
