\n'I grante,' he said and thar-with-all \nHe lowtyt and his leve has tane \nAnd towart his countre is he gane. \n\n \n\n255 Now takis James his viage \nTowart Douglas his heritage \nWith twa yemen foroutyn ma. \nThat wes a symple stuff to ta \nA land or castell to wyn, \n260 The-quhether he yarnyt to begyn \nTill bring purpos till ending \nFor gud help is in gud begynnyng \nFor gud begynnyng

off mobleis and off cateill \nAnd had bene till his fadyr leyll, \nAnd till himselff in his youthed \nHe haid done mony a thankfull deid, \nThom Dicson wes his name perfay. \n280 Till him he send and gan him pray \nThat he wald cum all anerly \nFor to spek with him prevely, \nAnd he but daunger till him gais. \nBot fra he tauld him quhat he wais \n285 He gret for joy and for pite \nAnd him rycht

\nSa wrocht he throu sutelte \nThat all the lele men off that land \nThat with his fadyr war dwelland \n295 This gud man gert cum ane and ane \nAnd mak him manrent everilkane, \nAnd he himselff fyrst

\nUnder the mantill nocht-forthi \n320 He suld be armyt prevely, \nAnd quhen the men off his countre \nThat suld all boune befor him be \nHis ensenye mycht her hym cry, \nThen suld thai full enforcely \n325 Rycht ymyddys the kirk assaill \nThe Inglismen with hard bataill \nSua that nane mycht eschap thaim fra, \nFor thar-throuch trowyt thai to ta \nThe castell that besid wes ner. \n330 And quhen this that I tell you her \nWes divisyt and undertane \nIlkane till his hous hame is gane \nAnd held this spek in prevete \nTill the day off thar assemble. \n\n \n\n335 The folk apon the Sonounday \nHeld to Saynct Bridis kyrk thar way, \nAnd thai that in the castell war \nIschyt out bath less and mar \nAnd went thar palmys for to ber, \n340 Outane a cuk and a portere. \nJames off Douglas off thar cummyng \nAnd quhat thai war had witting, \nAnd sped him till the kyrk in hy, \nBot or he come, to hastily \n345 Ane of his cryit, 'Douglas, Douglas.' \nThomas Dikson, that nerrest was \nTill

entryt in foroutyn debate \nAnd fand the mete all redy graid \nAnd burdys set and claithis laid \nThe yhattis then he gert sper \n390 And sat and eyt all at layser, \nSyne all the gudis turssyt thai \nThat thaim thocht thai mycht haiff away, \nAnd namly wapnys and armyng \nSilver and tresour and clethyng. \n395 Vittalis that mycht nocht tursyt be \nOn this maner destroyit he, \nAls quheyt and flour and meill and malt \nIn the wyne-sellar gert he bring \n400 And samyn on the flur all flyng \nAnd the presonaris that he had tane \nRycht tharin gert he heid ilkane, \nSyne off the tounnys the

fele thar mellyt wer \n410 Callit it 'the Douglas lardner.' \nSyne tuk he salt as Ic hard tell \nAnd ded hors and fordid the well, \nAnd brynt all outakyn stane, \nAnd is furth with his menye gayne \n415 Till his resett, for him thocht weill \nGiff he had haldyn the castell \nIt had bene assegyt raith \nAnd that him thocht to mekill waith, \nFor he had na hop of reskewyng. \n420 And it is to peralous thing \nIn castell assegyt to be \nQuhar want is off thir thingis thre, \nVittaill or men with thar armyng \nOr than gud hop off rescuyng, \n425 And for he dred thir thingis suld faile \nHe chesyt furthwart to travaill \nQuhar he mycht at his larges be \nAnd sua dryve furth his destane. \n\n \n\nOn this wise wes the castell tan \n430 And slayne that war tharin ilkan. \nThe Douglas syne all his menye \nGert in ser placis departyt be, \nFor men suld les wyt quhar thai war \nThat yeid departyt her and thar. \n435 Thaim that war woundyt gert he ly \nIntill hiddillis all prevely, \nAnd gert gud lechis till thaim bring \nQuhill that thai war intill heling, \nAnd himselff with a few menye \n440 Quhile ane quhile twa and quhilis thre \nAnd umquhill all him allane \nIn hiddillis throu the land is gane. \nSa dred he Inglismennys mycht \nThat he durst nocht wele cum in sycht \n445 For thai war that tyme all-weldand \nAs maist lordis our all the land. \nBot tithandis that scalis sone \nOff this deid that Douglas has done \nCome to the Cliffurd his ere in hy, \n450 That for his tynsaill wes sary \nAnd menyt his men that thai had slane, \nAnd syne has to his purpos tane \nTo big the castell up agayne. \nTharfor as man off mekill mayne \n455 He assemblit gret cumpany, \nAnd till Douglas he went in hy \nAnd biggyt up the castell swyth \nAnd maid it rycht stalwart and styth \nAnd put tharin vittalis and men. \n460 Ane of the Thyrlwallys then \nHe left behind him capitane \nAnd syne till Ingland went agayne. \n\n \n\nInto Carrik lyis the king \nWith a full symple gadryng, \n465 He passyt nocht twa hunder men. \nBot Schyr Edward his broder then \nWes in Galloway weill ner him by, \nWith him ane other cumpany \nThat held the strenthis off the land, \n470 For thai durst nocht yeit tak on hand \nTill our-rid the land planly. \nFor off Valence Schyr Amery \nWas intill Edynburgh lyand \nThat yeyt was wardane of the land \n475 Underneyth the Inglis king, \nAnd quhen he herd off the cummyng \nOff King Robert and his menye \nInto Carryk and how that he \nHad slain off the Persyis men \n480 His consaile he assemblit then, \nAnd with assent off his consaill \nHe sent till Ar him till assaill \nSchyr Ingrame the Umfravill that wes hardy \nAnd with him a  gret cumpany. \n485 And quhen Schyr Ingram cummyn wes thar \nHim thocht nocht speidfull for till far \nTill assaile him into the hycht, \nTharfor he thocht to wyrk with slycht \nAnd lay still in the castell than \n490 Till he gat speryng that a man \nOff Carrik, that wes sley and wycht \nAnd a man als off mekill mycht \nAs off the men off that cuntre, \nWes to the King Robert mast preve \n495 As he that wes his sibman ner, \nAnd quhen he wald foroutyn danger \nMycht to the kingis presence ga, \nThe-quhether he and his sonnys twa \nWar wonnand still in the cuntre \n500 For thai wald nocht persayvit be \nThat thai war speciall to the king. \nThai maid him mony tyme warnyng \nQuhen that thai his tynsaill mycht se, \nForthi in thaim affyit he. \n505 His name can I nocht tell perfay, \nBot Ik haiff herd syndry men say \nForsuth that his ane e wes out 506 \nBot he sa sturdy wes and stout 507 \nThat he wes the maist doutit man 507 \n510 That in Carrik lyvyt than. 508 \nAnd quhen Schyr Ingrame gat wittering \nForsuth this wes na gabbing, \nEfter him in hy he sent \nAnd he come at his commandment. \n515 Schyr Ingrame that was sley and wis 513 \nTretyt with him than on sic wys \nThat he maid sekyr undertaking \nIn tresoun for to slay the king, \nAnd he suld haiff for his service \n520 Gyff he fullfillyt thar divice 518 \nWeill fourty pundis worth off land \nTill him and till his ayris ay lestand. \n\n \n\nThe tresoun thus is undertane, \nAnd he hame till his hous is gane \n525 And wattyt opertunyte 523 \nFor to fulfill his mavyte. \nIn gret perell than was the king \nThat off this tresoun wyst na thing, \nFor he that he traistit maist of ane \n530 His ded falsly has undertane, 528 \nAnd nane may betreys tyttar than he \nThat man in trowis leawt\u00e9. \nThe king in him traistyt, forthi \nHe had fullfillyt his felony \n535 Ne war the king throu Goddis grace 533 \nGat hale witting of his purchace, \nAnd how and for how mekill land \nHe tuk his slauchter apon hand. \nI wate nocht quha the warnyng maid, \n540 Bot on all tym sic hap he had 538 \nThat quhen men schup thaim to betrais \nHe

that ever it fell perd\u00e9 \nI trow he sall the warrer be. \nNocht-forthi the tratour ay \n550 Had in his thocht bath nycht and day 548 \nHow he mycht best bring till ending \nHis tresonabill undretaking, \nTill he umbethinkand him at the last \nIntill his hart gan umbecast \n555 That the king had in custome ay 553 \nFor to rys arly ilk day \nAnd pas weill fer fra his menye \nQuhen he wald

\nBot yeit off purpos failit thai, \n565 And nocht-forthi thai come all thre 563 \nIn a covert that wes preve \nQuhar the king oft wes wont to ga \nHis preve nedys for to ma. \nThair hid thai thaim till his cumming, \n570 And the king into the mornyng 568 \nRais quhen that his liking was \nAnd rycht towart that covert gais \nQuhar lyand war the tratouris thre \nFor to do thar his prevete. \n575 To tresoun tuk he then na heid 573 \nBot he wes wont quharever he yeid \nHis swerd about his hals to ber \nAnd that availlyt him gretli ther \nFor had nocht God all thing weldand \n580 Set help intill his awine hand 578 \nHe had bene ded withoutyn dreid. \nA chamber page thar with him yeid, \nAnd sua foroutyn falowis ma \nTowart the covert gan he ga. \n585 Now bot God help the noble king 583 \nHe is ner-hand till his ending, \nFor that covert that he yeid till \nWes on the tother sid a hill \nThat nane of his men mycht it se. \n590 Thiddirwart went this page and he 588 \nAnd quhen he cummyn
