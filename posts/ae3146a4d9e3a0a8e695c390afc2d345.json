{"subject": "Sonnet XII", "text": "As the lone, frighted user of a night-road\nSuddenly turns round, nothing to detect,\nYet on his fear's sense keepeth still the load\nOf that brink-nothing he doth but suspect;\nAnd the cold terror moves to him more near\nOf something that from nothing casts a spell,\nThat, when he moves, to fright more is not there,\nAnd's only visible when invisible\nSo I upon the world turn round in thought,\nAnd nothing viewing do no courage take,\nBut my more terror, from no seen cause got,\nTo that felt corporate emptiness forsake,\n  And draw my sense of mystery's horror from\n  Seeing no mystery's mystery alone."}
