{"subject": "Out, Out", "text": "The buzz-saw snarled and rattled in the yard\nAnd made dust and dropped stove-length sticks of wood,\nSweet-scented stuff when the breeze drew across it.\nAnd from there those that lifted eyes could count\nFive mountain ranges one behind the other\nUnder the sunset far into Vermont.\nAnd the saw snarled and rattled, snarled and rattled,\nAs it ran light, or had to bear a load.\nAnd nothing happened: day was all but done.\nCall it a day, I wish they might have said\nTo please the boy by giving him the half hour\nThat a boy counts so much when saved from work.\nHis sister stood beside them in her apron\nTo tell them \"Supper.\" At that word, the saw,\nAs if to prove saws knew what supper meant,\nLeaped out at the boy's hand, or seemed to leap -\nHe must have given the hand. However it was,\nNeither refused the meeting. But the hand!\nThe boy's first outcry was a rueful laugh,\nAs he swung toward them holding up the hand\nHalf in appeal, but half as if to keep\nThe life from spilling. Then the boy saw all -\nSince he was old enough to know, big boy\nDoing a man's work, though a child at heart -\nHe saw all spoiled. \"Don't let him cut my hand off -\nThe doctor, when he comes. Don't let him, sister!\"\nSo. But the hand was gone already.\nThe doctor put him in the dark of ether.\nHe lay and puffed his lips out with his breath.\nAnd then - the watcher at his pulse took fright.\nNo one believed. They listened at his heart.\nLittle - less - nothing! - and that ended it.\nNo more to build on there. And they, since they\nWere not the one dead, turned to their affairs."}
