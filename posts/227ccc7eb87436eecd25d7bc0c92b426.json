{"subject": "Extract From", "text": "How has New England's romance fled,\nEven as a vision of the morning!\nIts rites foredone, its guardians dead,\nIts priestesses, bereft of dread,\nWaking the veriest urchin's scorning!\nGone like the Indian wizard's yell\nAnd fire-dance round the magic rock,\nForgotten like the Druid's spell\nAt moonrise by his holy oak!\nNo more along the shadowy glen\nGlide the dim ghosts of murdered men;\nNo more the unquiet churchyard dead\nGlimpse upward from their turfy bed,\nStartling the traveller, late and lone;\nAs, on some night of starless weather,\nThey silently commune together,\nEach sitting on his own head-stone\nThe roofless house, decayed, deserted,\nIts living tenants all departed,\nNo longer rings with midnight revel\nOf witch, or ghost, or goblin evil;\nNo pale blue flame sends out its flashes\nThrough creviced roof and shattered sashes!\nThe witch-grass round the hazel spring\nMay sharply to the night-air sing,\nBut there no more shall withered hags\nRefresh at ease their broomstick nags,\nOr taste those hazel-shadowed waters\nAs beverage meet for Satan's daughters;\nNo more their mimic tones be heard,\nThe mew of cat, the chirp of bird,\nShrill blending with the hoarser laughter\nOf the fell demon following after!\nThe cautious goodman nails no more\nA horseshoe on his outer door,\nLest some unseemly hag should fit\nTo his own mouth her bridle-bit;\nThe goodwife's churn no more refuses\nIts wonted culinary uses\nUntil, with heated needle burned,\nThe witch has to her place returned!\nOur witches are no longer old\nAnd wrinkled beldames, Satan-sold,\nBut young and gay and laughing creatures,\nWith the heart's sunshine on their features;\nTheir sorcery--the light which dances\nWhere the raised lid unveils its glances;\nOr that low-breathed and gentle tone,\nThe music of Love's twilight hours,\nSoft, dream-like, as a fairy's moan\nAbove her nightly closing flowers,\nSweeter than that which sighed of yore\nAlong the charmed Ausonian shore!\nEven she, our own weird heroine,\nSole Pythoness of ancient Lynn,'\nSleeps calmly where the living laid her;\nAnd the wide realm of sorcery,\nLeft by its latest mistress free,\nHath found no gray and skilled invader.\nSo--perished Albion's 'glammarye,'\nWith him in Melrose Abbey sleeping,\nHis charmed torch beside his knee,\nThat even the dead himself might see\nThe magic scroll within his keeping.\nAnd now our modern Yankee sees\nNor omens, spells, nor mysteries;\nAnd naught above, below, around,\nOf life or death, of sight or sound,\nWhate'er its nature, form, or look,\nExcites his terror or surprise,\nAll seeming to his knowing eyes\nFamiliar as his 'catechise,'\nOr 'Webster's Spelling-Book.'"}
