{"subject": "The Fairy and the Firefly", "text": "One night I saw a battle\nbetween a firefly\nand a fairy.\n\nI think he was an Irish fairy,\nfor he grinned as he fought,\nand I know he was red-haired.\n\nThe wicked monster,\nbeast and bug at once,\ncharged the fairy\nagain and again,\nrushed and flew at him, fuming,\npulsating luminously with throbs of rage,\nas if a winged bull of Nineveh\nwere in the ring with a toreador- \na winged bull that had swallowed\na kitchen range,\nwhich glowed through its iron ribs,\nand, like a matador,\nthe red-haired fairy dodged and side-stepped the furious rushes,\nand finally ripped up the beetle and laid it,\nextinguished and gray,\namong the other ashes\nat the feet of a little brown and gold lady\n(Queen Mab herself, perhaps)\nwho had been watching the struggle from a hickory limb\nand nervously swallowing sparks \nfrom time to time\nto keep her courage warm.\n\nFor all this took place in a bed of coals,\nin a valley beneath a half-burned log,\nin an open fireplace.\n\nIt was a scene that came out of the wood.\n\nIt was a thing,\nfor all I know,\nthat had actually happened\nsome night forty years ago,\nwhen the wood was green\nand growing\nand sucking in through leaf and root\nall the secret, deep, essential life\nof the abounding forest.\n\nThe logs drink up the spirit of the midwoods,\nthe sense of it,\nthe moods and humors of it- \nApril riots,\nscamperings of squirrels, \nJune dusks,\nquick glintings of bright eyes,\nstir of wings- \nand when the bark chars\nand the sap sings\nit all comes out of the logs again\nin flame and song and dream and drama.\n\nPoke the fire and pick your forest- \nyou may have the heart of any woods you will,\nfrom Arcadia to Arden."}
