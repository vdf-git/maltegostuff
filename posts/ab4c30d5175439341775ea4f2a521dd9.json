{"subject": "The Battle Of Goddeu", "text": "I have been a multitude of shapes,\nBefore I assumed a consistent form.\nI have been a sword, narrow, variegated,\nI will believe when it is apparent.\nI have been a tear in the air,\nI have been in the dullest of stars.\nI have been a word among letters,\nI have been a book in the origin.\nI have been the light of lanterns,\nA year and a half.\nI have been a continuing bridge,\nOver three score river-mouths.\nI have been a course, I have been an eagle.\nI have been a coracle in the sea.\nI have been complaint in the banquet.\nI have been a drop in a shower;\nI have been a sword in the grasp of a hand.\nI have been a shield in battle.\nI have been a string in a harp,\nDisguised for nine years.\nIn water, in foam,\nI have been a sponge in fire,\nI have been wood in covert.\nI am not he who will not sing of\nA combat though small,\nThe conflict of the battle of Godau of sprigs.\nAgainst the Guledig of Prydain,\nThere passed central horses,\nFleets full of riches.\nThere passed an animal with wide jaws,\nOn it were a hundred heads.\nAnd a battle was contested\nUnder the root of his tongue;\nAnd another battle there is\nIn his occiput.\nA black sprawling toad,\nWith a hundred claws on it,\nA snake speckled, crested.\nA hundred souls through sin\nShall be tormented in its flesh.\nI have been in Care Vevenir,\nThither hastened grass and trees.\nMinstrels were singing,\nWarrior bands were wondering,\nAt the exaltation of the Brython,\nThat Gwydyon effected.\nThere was a calling on the Creator,\nUpon Christ for causes,\nUntil when the Eternal\nShould deliver those whom he had made.\nThe Lord answered them,\nThrough language and elements:\nTake the forms for the principal trees,\nArranging yourselves in battle array,\nAnd restraining the public.\nInexperienced in battle hand to hand.\nWhen the trees were enchanted,\nIn the expectation of not being trees,\nThe trees uttered their voices\nFrom strings of harmony\nThe disputes ceased.\nLet us cut short heavy days,\nA female restained the din.\nShe came forth altogether lovely.\nThe head of the line, the head was a female.\nThe advantage of a sleepless cow\nWould not make us give way.\nThe blood of men up to our thighs,\nThe greatest of importunate mental exertions\nSported into the world.\nAnd one has ended\nFrom considering the deluge,\nAnd Christ crucified,\nAnd the day of judgement near at hand.\nThe alder-trees, the head of the line,\nFormed the van.\nThe willows and quicken-trees\nCame late to the army.\nPlum-trees, they are scarce,\nUnlonged for men.\nThe elaborate medlar-trees,\nThe objects of contention.\nThe prickly rose bushes,\nAgainst a host of giants,\nThe raspberry brake did\nWhat is better failed\nFor the security of life.\nPrivet and woodbine\nAnd ivy on its front,\nLife furze to the combat\nThe cherry-tree was provoked.\nThe birch, not withstanding his high mind,\nWas late before he was arrayed.\nNot because of his cowardice,\nBut on account of his greatness.\nThe laburnum held in mind,\nThat your wild nature was foreign.\nPine-trees in the porch,\nThe chair of distribution\nBy me greatly exalted,\nIn the presence of kings.\nThe elm with his retinue,\nDid not go aside a foot;\nHe would fight with the centre,\nAnd the flanks, and the rear.\nHazel-trees, it was judged\nThat ample thy mental exertion.\nThe privet, happy is his lot,\nThe bull of battle, the lord of the world.\nMorawg and Morydd\nWere made prosperous in pines.\nHolly, it was tinted with green,\nHe was a hero.\nThe hawthorn, surrounded by prickles,\nWith pain at his hand.\nThe aspen-wood has been topped,\nIt was topped in battle.\nThe fern that was plundered.\nThe broom in the van of the army,\nIn the trenches he was hurt.\nThe gorse did not do well,\nNotwithstanding let it overspread.\nThe heath was victorious, keeping off on all sides.\nThe common people were charmed,\nDuring the proceeding of the men.\nThe oak, quick moving,\nBefore him, tremble heaven and earth.\nA valiant door-keeper against an enemy,\nHis name is considered.\nThe blue-bells combined,\nAnd caused a consternation.\nIn rejecting, were rejected.\nPear-trees, the best intruders\nin the conflict on the plain.\nA very wrathful wood,\nThe chestnut is bashful,\nThe opponent of happiness,\nThe jet has become black,\nThe mountain has become crooked,\nThe woods have become a kiln,\nExisting formerly has the great seas,\nSine was heard the shout:--\nThe tops of the birch covered us with leaves.\nAnd transformed us, and changed our faded state.\nThe branches of the oak have ensnared us\nFrom the Gwarchan Mwelderw.\nLaughing on the side of rock,\nThe rold is not an ardent nature.\nNot of mother and father was I made,\nDid my Creator create me.\nOf nine-formed faculties,\nOf the fruit of fruits,\nOf the fruit of the primordial God,\nOf primroses and blossoms on the hill,\nOf the earth, of an earthly course,\nWhen I was formed,\nOf the flower nettles,\nOf the water of the ninth wave.\nI was enchanted by Math,\nBefore I became immortal,\nI was enchanted by Gwydyon\nThe great purifier of the Brithon,\nOf Eurwys, of Euron,\nOf Euron, of Modron.\nOf five battalions of scientific ones,\nTeachers, children of Math.\nWhen the removal occurred,\nI was enchanted by the Guledig.\nWhen he was half-burnt,\nI was enchanted by the sage\nOf Sages, in the primitive world.\nWhen I had a being;\nWhen the host of the world was in dignity,\nThe bard was accustomed to benefits.\nTo the song of praise I am inclined, which the tongue recites.\nI played in twilight,\nI slept in purple;\nI was truly in the enchantment\nWith Dylan, the son of the wave.\nIn the circumfrence, in the middle,\nBetween the knees of kings,\nScattering spears not keen,\nFrom heaven when came,\nTo the great deep, floods,\nIn the battle there will be\nFour score hundreds,\nThat will divide according to their will.\nAre they neither older or younger,\nThan myself in their divisions.\nA wonder, Canhwr are born, every one of nine hundred.\nHe was with me also,\nWith my sword spotted with blood.\nHonor was allotted to me\nBy the Lord, and protection (was) where he was.\nIf I come to where the boar was killed,\nHe will compose, he will decompose,\nHe will form languages.\nThe strong-handed gleamer, his name,\nWith a gleam he rules his numbers.\nThey would spread out in a flame,\nWhen I shall go on high.\nI have been a speckled snake on the hill,\nI have been a viper in Llyn.\nI have been a bill-hook crooked that cuts,\nI have been a ferocious spear\nWith my chasuble and bowl\nI will prophesy not badly.\nFour score smokes\nOn every one that bring.\nFive battalians of arms\nWill be caught by my knife.\nSix steads of yellow hue\nA hundred times better is\nmy cream-colored steed,\nSwift as the sea-mew\nWhich will not pass\nBetween the sea and the shore.\nAm I not pre-eminent in the field of blood?\nOver it are a hundred chieftains.\nCrimson (is) the gem of my belt,\nGold my shield border.\nThere has not been born, in the gap,\nThat has been visiting me,\nExcept Goronwy,\nFrom the dales of Edrywy.\nLong white my fingers,\nIt is long since I have been a herdsman.\nI have travelled the earth,\nBefore I was proficient in learning.\nI have travelled, I made a circuit,\nI slept in a hundred islands.\nA hundred Caers I have dwelt in.\nYe intelligent Druids,\nDeclare to Arthur,\nWhat is there more early\nThan I that they sing of.\nAnd one is come\nFrom considering the deluge\nAnd Christ crucified,\nAnd the day of future doom.\nA golden gem in a golden jewel.\nI am splendid\nAnd shall be wanton\nFrom the oppression of the metal-workers."}
