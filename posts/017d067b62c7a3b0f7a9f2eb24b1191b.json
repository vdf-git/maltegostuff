{"subject": "Sonnet Xlvi:", "text": "XLVI\n\nToday the lady of my heart was born \nInto this checkered world of joy and pain; \nAnd if my eyes are cloudy, and will rain \nA few sad drops to mar her shining morn, \n'Tis not because my life, else quite forlorn, \nIs dark and sullen to the inmost grain, \nAnd churl-like holds its chiefest blessing vain, \nAnd treats her beauty with ungrateful scorn. \nOh! no; I prize my fortune at its height; \nI kiss the easy fetters of my thrall; \nOver and over, in the view of all. \nBut, ah! beshrew me, in her purer sight, \nDo I not seem a shadow of the night, \nPresaging ruin wheresoe'er I fall?"}
