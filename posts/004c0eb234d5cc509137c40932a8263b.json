{"subject": "Winter", "text": "Winter, some call thee fair,\nYea! flatter thy cold face\nWith vain compare\nOf all thy glittering ways\nAnd magic snows\nWith summer and the rose;\nThy phantom flowers\nAnd fretted traceries\nOf crystal breath,\nThy frozen and fantastic art of death,\nWith April as she showers\nThe violet on the leas,\nAnd bares her bosom\nIn the blossoming trees,\nAnd dances on her way\nTo laugh with May-\nWinter that hath no bird\nTo sing thee, and no bloom\nTo deck thy brow:\nTo me thou art an empty haunted room,\nWhere once the music\nOf the summer stirred,\nAnd all the dancers\nFallen on silence now."}
