Dwindling now? \n That small falcon somehow \n quarried out of a rainbow \n in its saffron and ash-blue \n blazons \u2014 and nary a one \n seen yet, and the year half-gone? \n\n Watching two of them once \n tumbling among canyons \n and crags of summer cloud, \n I felt top-lofty, proud \n to be in the same world with them. \n But I suppose, even then, \n it had been moot how much \n longer they could live with us."}
