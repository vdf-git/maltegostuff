{"subject": "Hymn For The Two Hundredth Anniversary Of King\u2019s Chapel -", "text": "SUNG BY THE CONGREGATION TO THE TUNE OF\nTALLIS'S EVENING HYMN\n\nO'ERSHADOWED by the walls that climb,\nPiled up in air by living hands,\nA rock amid the waves of time,\nOur gray old house of worship stands.\n\nHigh o'er the pillared aisles we love\nThe symbols of the past look down;\nUnharmed, unharming, throned above,\nBehold the mitre and the crown!\n\nLet not our younger faith forget\nThe loyal souls that held them dear;\nThe prayers we read their tears have wet,\nThe hymns we sing they loved to hear.\n\nThe memory of their earthly throne\nStill to our holy temple clings,\nBut here the kneeling suppliants own\nOne only Lord, the King of kings.\n\nHark! while our hymn of grateful praise\nThe solemn echoing vaults prolong,\nThe far-off voice of earlier days\nBlends with our own in hallowed song:\n\nTo Him who ever lives and reigns,\nWhom all the hosts of heaven adore,\nWho lent the life His breath sustains,\nBe glory now and evermore!"}
