{"subject": "Autumn Leaves", "text": "Behold that tree in autumn's dim decay, \nStripped by the frequent chill and eddying wind; \nWhere yet some yellow lonely leaves we find \nLingering and trembling on the naked spray, \nTwenty, perchance, for millions whirled away! \nEmblem--alas too just!--of human kind: \nVain man expects longevity, designed \nFor few indeed; and their protracted day--\n\nWhat is it worth that wisdom does not scorn? \nThe blasts of sickness, care, and grief appal, \nThat laid the friends in dust, whose natal morn \nRose near their own!--and solemn is the call; \nYet, like those weak, deserted leaves forlorn, \nShivering they cling to life and fear to fall."}
