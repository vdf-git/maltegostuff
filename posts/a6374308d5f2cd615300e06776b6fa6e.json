{"subject": "Madness", "text": "(For Sara Teasdale) \n\nThe lonely farm, the crowded street,\n The palace and the slum,\nGive welcome to my silent feet\n As, bearing gifts, I come. \n\nLast night a beggar crouched alone,\n A ragged helpless thing;\nI set him on a moonbeam throne --\n Today he is a king. \n\nLast night a king in orb and crown\n Held court with splendid cheer;\nToday he tears his purple gown\n And moans and shrieks in fear. \n\nNot iron bars, nor flashing spears,\n Not land, nor sky, nor sea,\nNor love's artillery of tears\n Can keep mine own from me. \n\nSerene, unchanging, ever fair,\n I smile with secret mirth\nAnd in a net of mine own hair\n I swing the captive earth."}
