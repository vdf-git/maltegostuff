Here we gang,\n Jumpin' roun' the hoose wi' glee;\nStoppin' whiles afore the glass\n To let the lauchin' laddie see.\nLosh me, hoo he gecks an' goos,\n An' shogs an' sweys frae side to side;\nIs his heid, like some we ken,\n Turn'd wi' his cockie-roosie-ride.\nNo ae minute can I stan',\n Roun' the hoose we gang again,\nWhile the rascal tries to mak'\n My mutch-strings ser' him for a rein.\nHoo he kicks an' tries to spur,\n An' thraws his face wi' very pride;\nGudesake! has he min' o' men\n When at his cockie-roosie-ride.\nWhat's the matter wi' him noo,\n That he's takin' sic a grup,\nSignin' wi' the ither han'\n For Jock to han' him up his whup?\nWad the sorra really strike\u2014\n Bairns are unco ill to guide\u2014\nStrike his mammy, on whase back\n He tak's his cockie-roosie-ride?\nThere, noo, juist as I had thocht,\n Struck the wa' press wi' his croon;\nWhup an' strings are a' let gae,\n As I boo to set him doon.\nWhat a greetin' bairn, an' yet\n Siccan knocks are ill to bide;\nBless him, he'll get waur, I doot,\n In life's cockie-roosie-ride.\nDinna greet, but cuddle doon\n Safe an' snug on mammy's knee;\nCuddle, an' she'll clap his heid,\n An' mak' it better in a wee.\nSee, he's sabbit into sleep,\n Thinkin' nae what may betide\nWhen he turns a man, an' tak's\n Anither cockie-roosie-ride.\nA' this warl's naething mair\n But a ride to rich an' poor;\nUp an' doon we ride oor day\n Gettin' mony a fa' an' cloor;\nThen at last, when tir'd an' sair\n Wi' wan'erin' unco far an' wide,\nQuately are we slippit doon\n Frae oor cockie-roosie-ride."}
