(I take it I am Reader Three?)\u201d\n\nI hate sarcasm.  Rowleds was bad enough.\n\nIn this scenario (sketchy, admittedly)\nwe seem to be standing near a table\ncovered with paper cups,\nin each or most of which are deposited\ncoffee granules, tea-bags  -  &amp; an urn is steaming  -\n\nthis is a conference  -\n\nthough the overall scenario ... sketchy, as we said before  -\na scenario \u201cfictional\u201d would not so much describe as explain ...  the scenario\n\nis discontinuous.  But getting less discontinuous, you\u2019ll admit.\nFor instance an ordinary suburban street constitutes the corner\nReader Two disappeared around  -  nearly\nknocking into John, who reappeared, a seeming poetic second wind,\ncoming the other way, &amp; nobbling Reader One, \nwho, when imagined walking away, stumbles almost \u2018blindly\u2019\nbeside a river or an empty public space  -  the less frequented\nentrance to a park or garden, say  -  &amp; in\n\nslightly more autumnal weather.\n\nWeird  -\nthree alternative backgrounds.\nAnyway!\nReader One tends to appear (mostly)\nin middle distance, small, &amp; shrinking further.  Tall trees\nloom overhead, emotive green shapes, poplars bend near him  -  her  -  them\n                  -  this reader.\nIn another scenario  -  one I had not even dreamed about  -\nthey will be disconsolate, distraught,\ntheir shame or dissatisfaction causing a loving partner\n(&amp; something of a reader \u2018themselves\u2019\n\n-  male or female, straight or gay  -\nbi in fact  -\n\nthough this is \u2018known\u2019\n-  let\u2019s nail something down  -\nonly to their mother ...)\n\ncausing them to spend a troubling night\n(\u2018them\u2019  -  perhaps both of them  -  but not Mom)\nconsoling the evident  -  i.e., evidently dispiriting  -  grief or anxiety\nthat assails their partner (unfortunate Reader One), in such a way\nthat they feel\n                              (desperately)\n                                                        \u2018shaken\u2019\nin their belief in their own sexual efficacy  -\n\nAm I unattractive?  am I worthless?  -\n\n&amp; suspect even more alarmingly\nthat their partner may themselves be bi-sexual,\n&amp; to have recently discovered it,\n                                                      &amp; to wish now\n-  or soon, tomorrow  -  to change their lives together  -\nbased hitherto on one person\u2019s not knowing, &amp; on the other person\u2019s secret.\n\nSo Reader One evidently has real concerns  -\nwhichever one of the two Reader One is  -\n                                                                              &amp; it hardly matters\nfor my purposes, or yours if you\u2019re following me  -\n\nbecause you\u2019re a skilled reader, with \u2018time on your hands\u2019.
