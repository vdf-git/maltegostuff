{"subject": "Bivouac On A Mountain Side", "text": "I see before me now a traveling army halting, \nBelow a fertile valley spread, with barns and the orchards of summer, \nBehind, the terraced sides of a mountain, abrupt, in places rising high, \nBroken, with rocks, with clinging cedars, with tall shapes dingily seen, \nThe numerous camp-fires scatter'd near and far, some away up on the mountain, \nThe shadowy forms of men and horses, looming, large-sized, flickering, \nAnd over all the sky--the sky! far, far out of reach, Studded, breaking out, the eternal stars."}
