{"subject": "A Good-Bye", "text": "FAREWELL! How soon unmeasured distance rolls \nIts leaden clouds between our parted souls! \nHow little to each other now are we-- \nAnd once how much I dreamed we two might be! \nI, who now stand with eyes undimmed and dry \nTo say good-bye-- \nTo say good-bye to all sweet memories, \nGood-bye to tender questions, soft replies; \nGood bye to hope, good-bye to dreaming too, \nGood-bye to all things dear--good-bye to you, \nWithout a kiss, a tear, a prayer, a sigh-- \nOur last good-bye. \nI had no chain to bind you with at all; \nNo grace to charm, no beauty to enthral; \nNo power to hold your eyes with mine, and make \nYour heart on fire with longing for my sake, \nTill all the yearning passed into one cry: \n'Love, not good-bye!' \nAh, no--I had no strength like that, you know; \nYet my worst weakness was to love you so! \nSo much too well--so much too well--or ill-- \nYet even that might have been pardoned still-- \nIt would have been had I been you--you I! \nBut now--good-bye! \nHow soon the bitter follows on the sweet! \nCould I not chain your fancy's flying feet? \nCould I not hold your soul--to make you play \nTo-morrow in the key of yesterday--? \nDear--do you dream that I would stoop to try? \nAh, no--Good-bye!"}
