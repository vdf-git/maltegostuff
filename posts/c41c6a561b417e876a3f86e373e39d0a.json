{"subject": "Desire", "text": "How the moountains call me to the place I want to be, \nI yearn to roam through valleys and set my spirit free, \nDiscovering the beauty of the early morning dawn, \nBeing there in Springtime to see the new lambs born, \nTo feel the gentle breeze blow warm against my face, \nThe joy of being able to escape the human race, \nStrolling through fields embellished with golden grain, \nGrowing to maturity helped by the wind and rain.\n\nThe hedgerows with hips and haws\n and spiders webs spun new, \nSparkling in the morning with diamond drops of dew, \nBanks of coloured flowers growing in the wild, \nMother Nature tends them, each one her sacred child, \nRabbits play by burrows, rarely undisturbed, \nHigh above the treetops I hear the singing birds, \nThe mountains and the valleys roll unending to the sea, \nBeckoning and pleading, they are calling out to me."}
