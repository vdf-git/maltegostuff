{"subject": "Bonny Mermaid Iii", "text": "UP and spoke the bonny mermaid,\nWi the comb and the glass in her hand;\nSays, Cheer up your hearts, my mariners all,\nYou are not very far from the land.\nAnd the raging seas do foam, foam,\nAnd the stormy winds do blow,\nWhile we poor sailors must mount to the top,\nWhen the landsmen they lye low.\nOut and spoke the captain of our ship,\nAnd a fine little man was he;\n\u2018O I've a wife in fair London town,\nAnd a widow this night she shall be.'\nOut and spoke the mate of our ship,\nAnd a tight little man was he;\n\u2018O I've a wife in Dublin city,\nAnd a widow this night she shall be.'\nOut and spoke our second mate,\nAnd a clever little man was he;\n\u2018Oh I have a wife in Greenoch town,\nAnd a widow this night she shall be.'\nOut and spoke our little prentice boy,\nAnd a fine little boy was he;\n\u2018Oh I am sorry for my mother,' he said,\n\u2018As you are for your wives all three.'\nOut and spoke the cook of our ship,\nAnd a rusty old dog was he;\nSays, I am as sorry for my pats and my pans\nAs you are for your wives all three."}
