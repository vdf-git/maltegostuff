{"subject": "Love And Sorrow", "text": "I thought our love at full, but I did err;\nJoy's wreath drooped o'er mine eyes; I could not see\nThat sorrow in our happy world must be\nLove's deepest spokesman and interpreter.\nBut, as a mother feels her child first stir\nUnder her heart, so felt I instantly\nDeep in my soul another bond to thee\nThrill with that life we saw depart from her.\nO mother of our angel-child! twice dear!\nDeath knits as well as parts, and still, I wis,\nHer tender radiance shall enfold us here;\nEven as the light borne up by inward bliss\nThreads the void glooms of space without a fear,\nTo print on farthest stars her pitying kiss."}
