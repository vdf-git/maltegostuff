{"subject": "Dome", "text": "Dates never change\non the calendar of faith\n\nbut light and wind are playing tricks\nwith the past.\n\nWords split like isotopes\nin this peacetime landscape\n\nof abandoned courtyards, empty cradles,\nwithered gardens and broken roofs.\n\nOnly the madman, in his garland of dried flowers,\nhas the right of passage here\n\nand the blind beggar who recollects nothing\nexcept the spider ticking in his wired skull.\n\nFor a second, between two versions\nof an echo, the past doesn't happen:\n\nthe dome remains, a roc's egg\nveined blue, shelled by wind.\n\nConfess\nto no crime of identity.\n\nWait until the guillotine falls\nin the vast silence of the heart."}
