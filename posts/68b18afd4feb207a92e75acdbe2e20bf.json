{"subject": "66", "text": "Cruell suspition, O! be now at rest,\nLet daily torments bring to thee some stay,\nAlas, make not my ill thy ease-full pray,\nNor giue loose raines to Rage, when Love's opprest.\nI am by care sufficiently distrest,\nNo Racke can stretch my heart more, nor a way\nCan I find out, for least content to lay\nOne happy foot of joy, one step that's blest.\nBut to my end thou fly'st with greedy eye,\nSeeking to bring griefe by bace Jealousie;\nO, in how strange a Cage am I kept in?\nNo little signe of favour can I proove,\nBut must be way'd, and turn'd to wronging love,\nAnd with each humour must my state begin."}
