{"subject": "In Salutation To The Eternal Peace", "text": "Men say the world is full of fear and hate,\nAnd all life's ripening harvest-fields await\nThe restless sickle of relentless fate.\n\nBut I, sweet Soul, rejoice that I was born,\nWhen from the climbing terraces of corn\nI watch the golden orioles of Thy morn.\n\nWhat care I for the world's desire and pride,\nWho know the silver wings that gleam and glide,\nThe homing pigeons of Thine eventide?\n\nWhat care I for the world's loud weariness,\nWho dream in twilight granaries Thou dost bless\nWith delicate sheaves of mellow silences?\n\nSay, shall I heed dull presages of doom,\nOr dread the rumoured loneliness and gloom,\nThe mute and mythic terror of the tomb?\n\nFor my glad heart is drunk and drenched with Thee,\nO inmost wind of living ecstasy!\nO intimate essence of eternity!"}
