{"subject": "Love And Music. Written At Oxford, When Young", "text": "Shall Love alone for ever claim\nAn universal right to fame,\nAn undisputed sway?\nOr has not Music equal charms,\nTo fill the breast with strange alarms,\nAnd make the world obey?\n\nThe Thracian bard, as poets tell,\nCould mitigate the powers of hell,\nEven Pluto's nicer ear:\nHis arts, no more than Love's, we find\nTo deities or men confined,\nDrew brutes in crowds to hear.\n\nWhatever favourite passion reign'd,\nThe poet still his right maintain'd\nO'er all that ranged the plain:\nThe fiercer tyrants could assuage,\nOr fire the timorous into rage,\nWhene'er he changed the strain.\n\nIn milder lays the bard began;\nSoft notes through every finger ran,\nAnd echoing charm'd the place:\nSee! fawning lions gaze around,\nAnd, taught to quit their savage sound,\nAssume a gentler grace.\n\nWhen Cymon view'd the fair one's charms,\nHer ruby lips, and snowy arms,\nAnd told her beauties o'er:\nWhen Love reform'd his awkward tone,\nAnd made each clownish gesture known,\nIt show'd but equal power.\n\nThe bard now tries a sprightlier sound,\nWhen all the feather'd race around\nPerceived the varied strains;\nThe soaring lark the note pursues;\nThe timorous dove around him coos,\nAnd Philomel complains.\n\nAn equal power of Love I've seen,\nIncite the deer to scour the green,\nAnd chase his barking foe.\nSometimes has Love, with greater might,\nTo challenge-nay-sometimes-to fight,\nProvoked the enamour'd beau.\n\nWhen Silvia treads the smiling plain,\nHow glows the heart of every swain,\nBy pleasing tumults tost!\nWhen Handel's solemn accents roll,\nEach breast is fired, each raptured soul\nIn sweet confusion lost.\n\nIf she her melting glances dart,\nOr he his dying airs impart,\nOur spirits sink away.\nEnough, enough! dear nymph, give o'er;\nAnd thou, great artist! urge no more\nThy unresisted sway.\n\nThus Love or Sound affects the mind:\nBut when their various powers are join'd,\nFly, daring mortal, fly!\nFor when Selinda's charms appear,\nAnd I her tuneful accents hear-\nI burn, I faint, I die!"}
