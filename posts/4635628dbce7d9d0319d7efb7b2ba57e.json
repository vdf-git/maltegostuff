{"subject": "A Sea Dream", "text": "We saw the slow tides go and come,\nThe curving surf-lines lightly drawn,\nThe gray rocks touched with tender bloom\nBeneath the fresh-blown rose of dawn.\n\nWe saw in richer sunsets lost\nThe sombre pomp of showery noons;\nAnd signalled spectral sails that crossed\nThe weird, low light of rising moons.\n\nOn stormy eves from cliff and head\nWe saw the white spray tossed and spurned;\nWhile over all, in gold and red,\nIts face of fire the lighthouse turned.\n\nThe rail-car brought its daily crowds,\nHalf curious, half indifferent,\nLike passing sails or floating clouds,\nWe saw them as they came and went.\n\nBut, one calm morning, as we lay\nAnd watched the mirage-lifted wall\nOf coast, across the dreamy bay,\nAnd heard afar the curlew call,\n\nAnd nearer voices, wild or tame,\nOf airy flock and childish throng,\nUp from the water's edge there came\nFaint snatches of familiar song.\n\nCareless we heard the singer's choice\nOf old and common airs; at last\nThe tender pathos of his voice\nIn one low chanson held us fast.\n\nA song that mingled joy and pain,\nAnd memories old and sadly sweet;\nWhile, timing to its minor strain,\nThe waves in lapsing cadence beat.\n\n. . . . .\n\nThe waves are glad in breeze and sun;\nThe rocks are fringed with foam;\nI walk once more a haunted shore,\nA stranger, yet at home,\nA land of dreams I roam.\n\nIs this the wind, the soft sea wind\nThat stirred thy locks of brown?\nAre these the rocks whose mosses knew\nThe trail of thy light gown,\nWhere boy and girl sat down?\n\nI see the gray fort's broken wall,\nThe boats that rock below;\nAnd, out at sea, the passing sails\nWe saw so long ago\nRose-red in morning's glow.\n\nThe freshness of the early time\nOn every breeze is blown;\nAs glad the sea, as blue the sky,--\nThe change is ours alone;\nThe saddest is my own.\n\nA stranger now, a world-worn man,\nIs he who bears my name;\nBut thou, methinks, whose mortal life\nImmortal youth became,\nArt evermore the same.\n\nThou art not here, thou art not there,\nThy place I cannot see;\nI only know that where thou art\nThe blessed angels be,\nAnd heaven is glad for thee.\n\nForgive me if the evil years\nHave left on me their sign;\nWash out, O soul so beautiful,\nThe many stains of mine\nIn tears of love divine!\n\nI could not look on thee and live,\nIf thou wert by my side;\nThe vision of a shining one,\nThe white and heavenly bride,\nIs well to me denied.\n\nBut turn to me thy dear girl-face\nWithout the angel's crown,\nThe wedded roses of thy lips,\nThy loose hair rippling down\nIn waves of golden brown.\n\nLook forth once more through space and time,\nAnd let thy sweet shade fall\nIn tenderest grace of soul and form\nOn memory's frescoed wall,\nA shadow, and yet all!\n\nDraw near, more near, forever dear!\nWhere'er I rest or roam,\nOr in the city's crowded streets,\nOr by the blown sea foam,\nThe thought of thee is home!\n\n. . . . .\n\nAt breakfast hour the singer read\nThe city news, with comment wise,\nLike one who felt the pulse of trade\nBeneath his finger fall and rise.\n\nHis look, his air, his curt speech, told\nThe man of action, not of books,\nTo whom the corners made in gold\nAnd stocks were more than seaside nooks.\n\nOf life beneath the life confessed\nHis song had hinted unawares;\nOf flowers in traffic's ledgers pressed,\nOf human hearts in bulls and bears.\n\nBut eyes in vain were turned to watch\nThat face so hard and shrewd and strong;\nAnd ears in vain grew sharp to catch\nThe meaning of that morning song.\n\nIn vain some sweet-voiced querist sought\nTo sound him, leaving as she came;\nHer baited album only caught\nA common, unromantic name.\n\nNo word betrayed the mystery fine,\nThat trembled on the singer's tongue;\nHe came and went, and left no sign\nBehind him save the song he sung."}
