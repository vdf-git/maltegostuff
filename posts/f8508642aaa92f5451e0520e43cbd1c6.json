{"subject": "Natalia\u2019s Resurrection:  Sonnet Xxiv -", "text": "And, feeling round him, lo, upon the mould\nA pick and spade cast down by accident.\nAnd Adrian laughed when in those engines cold\nHe guessed the furtherers of his heart's intent.\nAnd all night through he wrought with them in rage,\nAs miners do who know the prize at hand.\nBlest Adrian! Now thy lips thou shalt engage\nIn the full solace thy long love has planned.\nHer face is near thee. Speed thee on thy task.\nHer breast's fair purity is thine to kiss.\nShe shall not now deny though thou shouldst ask\nHer whole soul's prize in ransom of thy bliss.\nThrice happy Adrian! See, thy hands have slid\nTrembling on thy Natalia's coffin lid."}
