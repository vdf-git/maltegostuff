{"subject": "The Other Draem In Which He Is Weightless", "text": "When finally Solomon would drop,\nheavy as a scuba diver from a boat,\ninto sleep, the table fan keeping quiet \nsentry over his body, he could dream,\n\npractice the shallow breath of leaving, \npush off the bed's earthly pitch, spit\n\nhis goggles and slip beneath the surface\nof knowing. The tired weight of himself\n\nleft twitching against his wife. The bedroom \nblinds breathing in perfect oscillations,\n\ndawn-purple, cool, and slatted as gills.\nWhen finally he could up-end himself,\n\nkick away from this world, follow \nthe jade columns of light down\n\nand down to the half-sunk mandible of reef, \nall molar and bone, barnacle and neon,\n\nhe could play again, whirl his diminished body \nin circles, the way he used to\ntease the neighbor's dog into chasing its own tail."}
