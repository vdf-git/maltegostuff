{"subject": "Day Of Love", "text": "He begged me to come\n back to him\n He promised me things\n that never did come true.\n And once again he broke my\n heart into two.\n Now I wonder why he walked\n away, why he couldn't stay.\n When he left he took my heart and\n left his memory.\n This day of love turned out to be\n A day for crying."}
