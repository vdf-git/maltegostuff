{"subject": "The City And The Silence", "text": "Deeper than ocean's thunder unsubdued,\nTitanic voices of the warfare strong\nOf man on fellow-man about me throng\nIn my captivity. Yet how elude\nThe tumult of the torrents that exclude\nThe voices that to loneliness belong?\nHow may I find thy silences, O Song?\nThine angels whisper but in solitude.\n\nI am set far from that. Fast as a flow'r\nIn some sad city-garden, for release\nI search my grim horizon without cease,\nCraving, if only for a little hour,\nThe stillness and the shadow of a bow'r\nWhere the blue mountains hold a realm of peace."}
