{"subject": "Friendships", "text": "It's not my desire to shatter the world by becoming a famous man, \nI'd be more than content if my days were spent shaking a friendly hand. \nIt's not my desire to leave my mark like a statue in the square, \nMy mind is content if my days are spent spreading friendship everywhere. It's not my desire to climb to the top leaving my loved ones behind, \nI'm more than content when my days are spent with friends who are loyal and kind. A friend in need is a friend indeed I've often heard people say, \nThat makes me content for my days are spent with a new friend every day. With this world in constant turmoil with misery and despair, \nwe could all be content if more time were spent, turning to God in prayer."}
