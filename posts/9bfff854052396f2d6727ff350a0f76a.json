{"subject": "A Tenth Anniversary Photograph, 1952", "text": "Look at their faces. You know it all. \nThey married the week he left for the war. \nBoth are gentle, intelligent people, \nas all four of their parents were. \n\nThey've never talked about much \nexcept the children. They love each other \nbut never wondered why they married \nor had the kids or stayed together. \n\nIt wasn't because they knew the answers. \nThey had never heard the questions \nthat twisted through the jokes to come \nof Moses and the Ten Suggestions. \n\nThey paid their debts and never doubted \nGod rewarded faith and virtue \nor when you got out of line \nhad big and little ways to hurt you. \n\nPeople walked alone in parks. \nChildren slept in their yards at night. \nMost every man had a paying job, \nand black was black and white was white. \n\nWould you go back? Say that you can, \nthat all it takes is a wave and a wink \nand there you are. So what do you do? \nThe question is crueler than you think."}
