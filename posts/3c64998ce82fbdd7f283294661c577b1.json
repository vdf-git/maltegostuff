{"subject": "Playing with Big Numbers", "text": "Human mind \nis essentially qualitative.\nAs you know\nwe are easily excited by \npinks and purples\ntriangles and circles \nand we endlessly argue\nover true and false\nright and wrong.\n\nBut the quantitative\nrarely touches our soul.\n\nNumbers were invented mainly \nby men to trick each other.\nWomen likely \nhad nothing to do with them; they \nhad more vital tasks, survival for example,\nat hand.\n\nYes, numbers are often shunned\nby our souls  \nbut playing with big numbers \ncould be real fun. \nSay if I were to sit on a gravel pit and \ncount one billion pebbles non-stop\nit will take me some 14 years.\nor if I were to count what Africa \nowes to rich foreigners - some 200 billion\ndollars (more infact) -  it is impossible. \nI will have to \nbe born 40 times and do nothing\nbut keep counting 24 hours.\n\nAlthough things could be simpler on a \nsmaller scale. Suppose as a result \nof the debt, five million children die\nevery year, as in fact they do, \nand each dying child cries \na minimum of 100 times a day \nthere would be a trillion cries \nfloating around\nin the atmosphere just over a \nperiod of five years.\nRemember a sound wave once\ngenerated never ceases to exist \nin one form or the other,\nand never escapes the atmosphere.\n\nNow one fine morning, even if \none of these cries suddenly hits \nyou, it will shatter your soul into \na billion pieces. It will take \n14 years to gather \nthe pieces and put them back \ninto one piece.\n\nOn the other hand, may be all the \ntrillion cries could hit your soul \nand nothing would happen.\n\nTranslated by the author"}
