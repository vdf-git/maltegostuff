{"subject": "Spell Of The North", "text": "Some call it lonely\n and a dark dreary place\n Up north toward the border\n past the White face\n Where the screech of the wildcat\n and the laugh of the loon\n Send shivers to those\n who don't know the north moon\n Where forests seem endless\n and rivers run clear\n As the days when the Chippewa\n bow-hunted the deer\n Where days can stand still\n in the passing of time.\n The north wolf he knows it\n with his howl in the pine\n It's driving me on\n I can't let the chance go\n So I'll be on my journey\n before the first snow\n And when thoughts come back\n of the gray city nights\n I'll be by the fire\n 'neath the blue northern lights"}
