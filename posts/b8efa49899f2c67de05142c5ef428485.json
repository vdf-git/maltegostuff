{"subject": "Bessey (I)", "text": "AGAIN, again that thrilling strain! \nVoice of the Past, thine accents chain \nTime's alter'd, onward track; \nLost hours are swelling round my heart, \nAnd bid it feel in every part \nThe tide of days roll'd back. \n\nIt is thy song, thy very note, \nFamiliar as thine own dear face; \nAround me now those accents float \nAs by our own hearth's resting-place. \n\nIt cannot be that years have gone, \nSince tones so fresh to thought were given; \nA day is all,--a single one,-- \nOh! 'tis the song of yester-even. \n\nAnd there comes in thy voice of glee, \nSweet Bessey, joined in harmony, \nMy Nella's strain to fill; \nOh! how familiar is that tone, \nClear, gay, untired, 'tis all thine own, \nThine, laughing Bessey, still. \n\nOh! stop not; thou dost break a dream, \nThat once was Truth, and still can bring \nSuch lively thoughts, as well may seem \nMore true than any living thing. \n\nBut 'tis a dream--between us stand \nAbsence and death, and grief and time; \nI see again the spectral band, \nAs sinks away that magic chime. \n\nAh! well, sweet Bessey, thou didst sleep, \nWhile bright with Life's first rays thine eye; \nEre weariness its light could steep, \nIt clos'd, with all its brilliancy. \n\nI saw thee, and thy face, though wan, \nStill smil'd that plaited coif beneath; \nAs though Life's stream had sparkled on, \nE'en till the very touch of Death. \n\nI gazed until I dream'd there came \nAgain Life's quick delicious flame \nThrough all thy pulses led; \nAnd though too soon the fancy wan'd, \nI did not touch thy frozen hand, \nI would not feel thee dead. \n\nBut years have taught, all silent grown, \nNo more to listen for thy tone, \nOr turn thy form to see; \nI do not, save when that old strain \nComes back and brings thy voice again, \nThy very voice to me."}
