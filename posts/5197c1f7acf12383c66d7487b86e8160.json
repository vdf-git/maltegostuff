{"subject": "Confused Emotions", "text": "I'm so confused as to how i feel\nThe pain I conceal is almost unreal\nI love you so much; care for you so\nBut it's hard for me to choose which way to go\n\nI know you love me-\nOf that there's no doubt.\nI just can't find a way to claw my way out\nOf this hole that I dug deep down in my soul\nYou're the only thing that makes me whole.\n\nAnd I know it hurts to hear this news\nThe fact that I'm scared to be in love with you\nAfraid you may hurt me-\nTake me for granted\nAnd break this heart\nThat to you I handed.\n\nI love your smile, \nYour sensitive eyes, \nThe way you holdme\nWhen I cry...\n\nBut I hate the way you've hurt me\nAnd made me feel low...\nSo to your invitation\nMy answer is 'no.'"}
