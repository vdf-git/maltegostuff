{"subject": "Close", "text": "You are within arms reach, \r\nClose enough to share the luring smell of your perfume,                  \r\nclose enough always, to bathe in your presence.\r\nNo more farther than a drunkard to his drink,      you are never farther than a glance away.\r\n\r\nRuin. \r\ndesolate ruin is my nature                         \r\npain is it's very essence.\r\nI've ripped apart yours, \r\nas well as my very own heart.\r\n not nearly as strong as trees, \r\nwho in storms merely sway.\r\nFor I had fallen in the winds of my own way. \r\n\r\nSo then It was I who put the staggering distance between our love.\r\na reciprocation of your love \r\nI may never again know. \r\nBecause it is I who boarded your love \r\nupon a train headed afar. \r\nYet still you are close. \r\nClose enough to bathe in your presence\r\nWhen I stretch the arm of my mind inward \r\nas far as it's limb can grasp.\r\n\r\nIt is there I can join you.\r\nIt is there I confide in you.\r\nYour love, It is there.\r\nIt is there I can be burned upon the fire, so as to feel something true.\r\nSo as to feel the love I have lost in you. \r\n\r\nAlways far, but always near. \r\nIt was once my fear.\r\nBut now what i hold most dear. \r\nThat is, \r\nTo only be able to hold you in my mind.\r\nAnd In no other, \r\nhappiness has been able \r\nto present itself for me to find."}
