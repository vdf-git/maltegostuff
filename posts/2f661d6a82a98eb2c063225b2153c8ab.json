{"subject": "The Anaconda", "text": "The anaconda is so magnificent, so complex, \nbut it confuses, \nconstricts, \ncorrupts. \nWho knows where one hides? \nThere could be by you right now, staring at you \nyet it would remain unnoticed. \nI fear anacondas; they are dangerous, \nand though I can handle them when confronted, \nthey can be so very hard to find, \nso terribly obscure."}
