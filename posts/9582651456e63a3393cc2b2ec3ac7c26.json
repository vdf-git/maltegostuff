{"subject": "Memorial Day", "text": "After our march from the Hudson to the top\nof Cemetery Hill, we Boy Scouts proudly endured\nthe sermons and hot sun while Girl Scouts\nlolled among graves in the maple shade.\nWhen members of the veterans' honor guard\naimed their bone-white rifles skyward and fired,\nI glimpsed beneath one metal helmet\nthe salmon-pink flesh of Mr. Webber's nose,\nrestored after shrapnel tore it.\n\n         2\nFriends who sat near me in school died in Asia,\nnow lie here under new stones that small flags flap\nbeside.\n          It's fifth-grade recess: war stories.\nMr. Webber stands before us and plucks\nhis glass eye from its socket, holds it high\nbetween finger and thumb. The girls giggle\nand scream; the awed boys gape. The fancy pocket watch\nhe looted from a shop in Germany\nticks on its chain."}
