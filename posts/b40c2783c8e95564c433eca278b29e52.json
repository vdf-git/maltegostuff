{"subject": "A Likely Lad", "text": "Child of a myriad varied voices calling\nO'er countless leagues of space in divers tongues,\nTho' captious critics view your ways appalling\nAnd fain would quiet your all too strident lungs,\nRaw youth must have its fling; and ten brief summers\nHardly suffice to make you a sage;\nSo, \u2018spite your crooners, clowns and jazz-drunk strummers,\nYou have not done so badly for your age.\n\nMuch water has flowed down many a river\n(The McIntyre at Yetman, let us say)\nSince first you set ethereal waves a-quiver\nWith that crude babbling of your natal day.\nYou're growing up, my lad, and waxing wiser;\nTho' still the crabbed, impatient censors rage.\nAs entertainer and as advertiser\nYou have not done so badly for your age.\n\nAnd many lonely men in lonely places,\nHave hailed you as a blessing and a joy,\nCondoning all your rather callow graces\nAnd that omniscient air that you employ,\nTho' still much over-prone to raucous bawling.\nAs boys will be, you're learning, stage by stage,\nThe wiser, weightier aspects of your calling,\nYou have not done so badly for your age.\n\nSince days when first we fumbled the cat's-whisker,\nAnd strained at ear-phones, yearning for a sound,\nYour lighter moods have brighter grown, and brisker,\nYour interludes of wisdom more profound.\nIf, thro' the next ten years, you keep on growing\nTo man's estate, and statelier arts engage,\nYou may please everyone; there is no knowing.\nStill, you have not done badly for your age."}
