{"subject": "No Children!", "text": "No children in the house to play\u2014\nIt must be hard to live that way!\nI wonder what the people do\nWhen night comes on and the work is through,\nWith no glad little folks to shout,\nNo eager feet to race about,\nNo youthful tongues to chatter on\nAbout the joy that's been and gone?\nThe house might be a castle fine,\nBut what a lonely place to dine!\n\nNo children in the house at all,\nNo fingermarks upon the wall,\nNo corner where the toys are piled\u2014\nSure indication of a child.\nNo little lips to breathe the prayer\nThat God shall keep you in His care,\nNo glad caress and welcome sweet\nWhen night returns you to your street;\nNo little lips a kiss to give\u2014\nOh, what a lonely way to live!\n\nNo children in the house! I fear\nWe could not stand it half a year.\nWhat would we talk about at night,\nPlan for and work with all our might,\nHold common dreams about and find\nTrue union of heart and mind,\nIf we two had no greater care\nThan what we both should eat and wear?\nWe never knew love's brightest flame\nUntil the day the baby came.\n\nAnd now we could not get along\nWithout their laughter and their song.\nJoy is not bottled on a shelf,\nIt cannot feed upon itself,\nAnd even love, if it shall wear,\nMust find its happiness in care;\nDull we'd become of mind and speech\nHad we no little ones to teach.\nNo children in the house to play!\nOh, we could never live that way!"}
