{"subject": "Miss C.O. Y R.", "text": "Why ask for those unintellectual verses \nthat once, insane with grief, I sang aghast? \nOr are you maybe throwing in my face \nmy rank ingratitude, my bitter past? \n\nWhy resurrect unhappy memories \nnow when the heart awaits from love a sign, \nor call the night when day begins to smile, \nnot knowing if another day will shine? \n\nYou wish to learn the cause of this dejection \ndelirium of despair that anguish wove? \nYou wish to know the wherefore of such sorrows, \nand why, a young soul, I sing not of love? \n\nOh, may you never know why! For the reason \nbrings melancholy but may set you laughing. \nDown with my corpse into the grave shall go \nanother corpse that's buried in my stuffing! \n\nSomething impossible, ambition, madness, \ndreams of the soul, a passion and its throes \nOh, drink the nectar that life has to offer \nand let the bitter dregs in peace repose! \n\nAgain I feel the impenetrable shadows \nshrouding the soul with the thick veils of night: \na mere bud only, not a lovely flower, \nbecause it's destitute of air and light \n\nBehold them: my poor verses, my damned brood \nand sorrow suckled each and every brat! \nOh, they know well to what they owe their being, \nand maybe they themselves will tell you what."}
