{"subject": "A Moth", "text": "I, like a moth to the candle,\nAm chained by a glance from your eye.\nIf I shun you, the world is in darkness;\nIf I seek my desire, I die.\nI hide 'neath the wings of my fancy,\nI seek out my room's darkest shade;\nYour shining still follows me ever,\nTill I fly to my doom unafraid.\nAnd yet, in my seeking I shun you,\nIn shunning I seek for love's sake;\nMy wings will draw near you, not save me,\nLike a bird's 'neath the eye of a snake.\nHave pity; I watched from my shadow\nA brother's wings fall 'neath your touch.\nLoved you not the joy of his flitting?\nOr is pride's cold victory such\n\nThat you laugh as he crawls from your glances,\nOr dies in his pain at your feet,\nSo hopeless, untrusting, despairing,\nNow hating the light that was sweet?\nHave pity; a hand in its kindness\nOnce opened the casement to me,\n\u2018Go forth, foolish fly, for your life's sake,\nGo forth! in the night you are free.\n\u2018God's lamps in the Heavens are glowing,\nMore fair is their lighting than this\nThat was lit with a spark from man's fingers.\nGo forth! lest you die in a kiss.\u2019\nThe light of the stars could not reach me,\nThe warmth of your flame on my heart,\nToo kind in their pity to wall me,\nThe fingers that saved were apart.\nHave mercy, my life that my death is,\nBlind, blind to your shining I fly.\nIf I shun you, the world is in darkness,\nIf I seek you, God help me! I die."}
