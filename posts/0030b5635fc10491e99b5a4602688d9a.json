{"subject": "Again Falling In Love", "text": "I don\u2019t belong to me, \nto you, to her, to him.\nWho are you, I ask myself\nagain falling in love for a tender shoot, \nuncoiling under the debris of unfaithful corners? \n\nI was watching a small birdie\nhopping against a mirror, cracking the beak\nto kill a rival.\n\nShe was pulling at my arm\nwhite death in red scarf.\n\nThis is for you my fellow-traveller, \na beautiful sector of my hidden garden, \nwhere I have permitted you to come for a walk.\nHand in hand we will watch the peerless evening \u2013\nsitting on the wings of gulls.\nWill you like to break a promise\nbefore I implode on the moon? \n\nYou light the earthen lamp daily under a tree, \nto possess me, trap me, digest me. Voicelessly\nI melt into smoke, fly away in small huffs."}
