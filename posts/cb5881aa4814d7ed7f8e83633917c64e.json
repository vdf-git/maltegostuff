{"subject": "In Human Closeness There Is A Secret Edge", "text": "In human closeness there is a secret edge,\nNor love nor passion can pass it above,\nLet lips with lips be joined in silent rage,\nAnd hearts be burst asunder with the love.\n\nAnd friendship, too, is powerless plot,\nAnd so years of bliss with noble tends,\nWhen your heart is free and known not,\nThe slow languor of the earthy sense.\n\nAnd they who strive to reach this edge are mad,\nBut they who reached are shocked with anguish hard -\nNow you know why beneath your hand\nYou do not feel the beating of my heart."}
