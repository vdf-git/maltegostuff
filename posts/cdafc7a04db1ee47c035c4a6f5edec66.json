{"subject": "The Old Man's Wish", "text": "If I live to be old, for I find I go down,\nLet this be my fate: In a country town\nMay I have a warm house, with a stone at the gate,\nAnd a cleanly young girl to rub my bald pate.\nMay I govern my passion with an absolute sway,\nAnd grow wiser and better as my strength wears away,\nWithout gout or stone, by a gentle decay.\n\nNear a shady grove, and a murmuring brook,\nWith the ocean at distance, whereupon I may look,\nWith a spacious plain without hedge or stile,\nAnd an easy pad-nag to ride out a mile.\nMay I govern my passion with an absolute sway,\nAnd grow wiser and better as my strength wears away,\nWithout gout or stone, by a gentle decay.\n\nWith Horace and Petrarch, and two or three more\nOf the best wits that reign'd in the ages before,\nWith roast mutton, rather than ven'son or veal,\nAnd clean though coarse linen at every meal.\nMay I govern my passion with an absolute sway,\nAnd grow wiser and better as my strength wears away,\nWithout gout or stone, by a gentle decay.\n\nWith a pudding on Sundays, with stout humming liquor,\nAnd remnants of Latin to welcome the vicar,\nWith Monte-Fiascone or Burgundy wine,\nTo drink the King's health as oft as I dine.\nMay I govern my passion with an absolute sway,\nAnd grow wiser and better as my strength wears away,\nWithout gout or stone, by a gentle decay.\n\nWith a courage undaunted may I face my last day,\nAnd when I am dead may the better sort say,\nIn the morning when sober, in the evening when mellow,\nHe's gone, and left not behind him his fellow.\nMay I govern my passion with an absolute sway,\nAnd grow wiser and better as my strength wears away,\nWithout gout or stone, by a gentle decay."}
