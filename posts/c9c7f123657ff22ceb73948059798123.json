{"subject": "The Wreath Of Forest Flowers", "text": "In a fair and sunny forest glade\nO\u2019erarched with chesnuts old,\nThrough which the radiant sunbeams made\nA network of bright gold,\nA girl smiled softly to herself,\nAnd dreamed the hours away;\nLulled by the sound of the murmuring brook\nWith the summer winds at play. \n\nJewels gleamed not in the tresses fair\nThat fell in shining showers,\nNaught decked that brow of beauty rare\nBut a wreath of forest flowers;\nAnd the violet wore no deeper blue\nThan her own soft downcast eye,\nWhilst her bright cheek with the rose\u2019s hue\nIn loveliness well might vie. \n\nBut she was too fair to bloom unknown\nBy forest or valley side,\nAnd long ere two sunny years had flown,\nThe girl was a wealthy bride\u2014\nRemoved to so high and proud a sphere\nThat she well at times might deem\nThe humble home of her childhood dear\nA fleeting, changeful dream. \n\nNo more her foot sought the grassy glade\nAt the break of summer day;\nNo more neath the chesnut spreading shade\nIn reverie sweet she lay;\nBut in abodes of wealth and pride,\nWith serious, stately mien,\nThat envy\u2019s rancorous tongue defied,\nShe now alone was seen. \n\nBut was she happier? Who might know?\nWealth, fortune, on her smiled;\nYet there were some who whispered low\nThat she, fates favored child,\nOft pressed her brow with a weary hand,\nIn gay and festive hours,\nAnd fain would change her jewell\u2019d band\nFor a wreath of forest flowers."}
