{"subject": "To Vittoria Colonna. (Sonnet Vi.)", "text": "When the prime mover of my many sighs\nHeaven took through death from out her earthly place,\nNature, that never made so fair a face,\nRemained ashamed, and tears were in all eyes.\nO fate, unheeding my impassioned cries!\nO hopes fallacious! O thou spirit of grace,\nWhere art thou now? Earth holds in its embrace\nThy lovely limbs, thy holy thoughts the skies.\nVainly did cruel death attempt to stay\nThe rumor of thy virtuous renown,\nThat Lethe's waters could not wash away!\nA thousand leaves, since he hath stricken thee down,\nSpeak of thee, nor to thee could Heaven convey,\nExcept through death, a refuge and a crown."}
