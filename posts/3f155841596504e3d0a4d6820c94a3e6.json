{"subject": "Champagne", "text": "A cold wind, later, but no rain. \nA bus breathing heavily at the station. \nBeggars at the gate, and the moon\nlike one bright horn of a white\ncow up there in space. But\n\nreally, must I think about all this\na second time in this short life? \nThis crescent moon, like a bit\nof ancient punctuation. This\n\npause in the transience of all things. \n\nUp there, Ishtar in the ship\nof life he's sailing.  Has\n\nhe ripped open again his sack of grain?\nSpilled it all over the place?\nBubbles rising to the surface, breaking.\n\nBeside our sharpened blades, they've\nset down our glasses of champagne.\nA joke is made.  But, really, must\n\nI hear this joke again?\n\nMust I watch the spluttering\nlight of this specific flame? Must I\nconsider forever the permanent\ntransience of all things:\n\nThe bus, breathing at the station.\nThe beggars at the gate.\nThe girl I was.\nBoth pregnant and chaste.\nThe cold wind, that crescent moon.\nNo rain. What difference\n\ncan it possibly make, that\npain, now that not a single\nanguished cry of it remains? \n\nReally, must I grieve it all again\na second time, and why tonight\nof all the nights, and just\nas I'm about to raise, with the\nblissful others, my\n\nglass to the silvery, liquid\nchandelier above us?"}
