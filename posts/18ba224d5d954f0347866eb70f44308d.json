{"subject": "American Sonnet for Wanda C.", "text": "Who I know knows why all those lush-boned worn-out girls are\nWhooping at where the moon should be, an eyelid clamped\nOn its lightness. Nobody sees her without the hoops firing in her\nEars because nobody sees. Tattooed across her chest she claims\nIs BRING ME TO WHERE MY BLOOD RUNS and I want that to be here\nWhere I am her son, pent in blackness and turning the night's calm\nLoose and letting the same blood fire through me. In her bomb hair:\nShells full of thunder; in her mouth: the fingers of some calamity,\nSomebody foolish enough to love her foolishly. Those who could hear\nNo music weren't listening\u2014and when I say it, it's like claiming\nShe's an elegy. It rhymes, because of her, with effigy. Because of her,\nIf there is no smoke, there is no party. I think of you, Miss Calamity,\nEvery Sunday. I think of you on Monday. I think of you hurling hurt\nWhere the moon should be and stomping into our darkness calmly."}
