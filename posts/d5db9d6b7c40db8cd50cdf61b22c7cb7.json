{"subject": "Ages", "text": "In that stone head, obscenity\nHas been preserved a thousand years;\nA bible-leaf of families\nHave shuddered at the pointed ears.\n\nThe sword that hangs upon the wall\nIs notched the length of its long blade,\nAnd children at the village school\nDream of the trusses it has mowed.\n\nClose against the lichened tower\nStill lives a witch. Around her head\nShe wears a shawl, and white as flour\nHer lips count every step she treads.\n\nBut when the dusk-born lovers stand\nThe figure sobs, 'Oh where's my soul?'\nThe sword sighs for the long-dead hand,\nThe old hag huddles from the owl."}
