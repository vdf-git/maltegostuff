{"subject": "To Christina, Queen Of Sweden", "text": "Verses to accompany a portrait of Cromwell\n\nBright Martial Maid, Queen of the frozen zone, \nThe northern pole supports thy shining throne. \nBehold what furrows age and steel can plough; \nThe helmet's weight oppressed this wrinkled brow. \nThrough fate's untrodden paths I move; my hands \nStill act my free-born people's bold commands; \nYet this stern shade, to you submits his frowns, \nNor are these looks always severe to crowns."}
