{"subject": "Farawell", "text": "Let mine eyes the parting take,\nWhich my faint lips never can; \nMoments such as these might break\nEven the sternest heart of man.\nMournfully doth Joy's eclipse,\nShroud in grief Love's sweetest sign; \nCold the pressure of thy lips,\nCold the hand that rests in mine.\nOnce the slightest stolen kiss\nO, what rapture did it bring! \nLike a violet's loveliness,\nFound and plucked in early spring.\nNow, no more my hand shall twine,\nRose wreaths, sweetest love, for thee; \nWithout, is summer's glorious prime,\nWithin, weird autumn's misery."}
