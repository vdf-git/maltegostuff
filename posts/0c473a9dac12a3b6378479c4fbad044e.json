{"subject": "The Charter;", "text": "ADDRESSED\nTO MY NEPHEW\nATHANASE C. L. COQUEREL,\nON HIS WEDDING DAY, 1819.\nCHILD of my heart! while others hail\nThis festive morn, when joys prevail,\nWith careless wishes they may last,\nSpite of all annals of the past;\nAs if for thee alone, secure,\nTheir fleeting nature would endure,\nWith roses strewing all thy way,\nAnd life were but a bridal day;--\n\nFor me, by pensive thoughts opprest,\nThe future fills my anxious breast;\nAnd flowers that fade, and joys that flee,\nAre not the things I ask, for thee!--\nMy heart for thee has learn'd to prove\nThe throbbings of a mother's love,\nSince on thy cradle fell the tear\nThat mourn'd a sister's early bier;\nAnd sure that angel's sainted prayer\nHas shed sweet influence o'er my care;\nTo sorrow doomed in all the rest,\nAnd only in her children blest!--\nWhile now you sign, with hope elate,\nThe civic register of fate;\nOr at the holy altar bow,\nTo ratify the plighted vow,\nWhich made aright, or breath'd amiss,\nIncludes all future woe, or bliss;\nWhile kneeling youth, and weeping beauty,\nHear the grave ritual of their duty,\n\nAnd the stern rubrick well approve\nThat charges to be true to love;\nThis compact, that for ever binds\nIn holy links two kindred minds,\nTheir happiness the mutual barter,\nThis solemn league we'll call a CHARTER !\nTh' allusion never can be wrong,\nWhite omens to the name belong;\nPalladium that has all withstood,\nAnd harbinger of boundless good.\nAnd ever may its hallow'd law\nYour willing hearts together draw!\nAh! may no ultra thirst of power\nEmbitter life's domestic hour;\nNo principles of feudal sway\nTeach without loving, to obey;\nThe heart such joyless homage slights,\nAnd wedlock claims its Bill of Rights--\nMay you, to Virtue nobly just,\nDisdain the whisper of mistrust;\n\nYour truth her dark police may brave,\nMade for the tyrant, and the slave.--\nMay Discord pass with sullen tread,\nFar from the threshold of your shed,\nWith accents that on harshness border,\nAnd words that love would call to order;\nOr veto he would pine to hear,\nProtesting only by a tear.--\nNor when true fondness, with submisison \nHer right asserting of petition,\nShall meekly hint at some abuse,\nOr some reform of gen'ral use,\nUnheeding all that she may say,\nPass to the order of the day.--\nNor, bidding every blessing fade,\nLet Jealousy your peace invade;\nWhose shadow clings to all that's dear,\nAnd adds the length'ning shapes of fear;\nWhose mind with sickly colours ting'd,\nDiscerns in all, the code infring'd,\n\nReads violations in the eye,\nAnd marks the treason of a sigh;\nOr loads a tear with false aspersion,\nMistaking sorrow for aversion;\nOr construes into acts of guile\nThe tender pleadings of a smile;\nCondemns unheard, with ultra fury,\nNor suffers love to call a jury,\nWhere innocence her head uprears,\nSafe, in a trial by her peers.--\nThus, having ne'er from duty swerved,\nThe faith of treaties well observ'd;\nWhen Time your destin'd lot shall fling\nOf sorrow from his loaded wing,\nFor you, of other good bereft,\nUnchanging love will still be left;\nNot like the world he then will roam,\nBut rest, the morning star of home.\nNot yours, their bitter fate, who know\nThat agony of lonely woe,\n\nAn altered heart was bound to share,\nNor find defence, nor charter there!\nFor you, to every duty true,\nThe Charter held in rev'rence due,\nEach tender clause shall habit seal,\nWith no suggestion of repeal;\nFirm to the law of true election,\nAnd treating change with stern rejection,\nThough time the graceful form has worn\nTo which fidelity was sworn:\nFor not alone with blooming youth\nIs made that league of lasting truth;\nThe compact sign'd with beauty now,\nIncludes wan age, with wrinkled brow,\nWith tresses grey, with visage pale,\nAnd eyes whose liquid lustre fail;\nFor then the hand, that shrivell'd thing,\nShall still display the nuptial ring,\nPledge of your faith, and cherish'd token\nOf vows, through lengthen'd years unbroken;\n\nWhen all that's left of passion's flame\nIs friendship, with a dearer name!\nThus be the charter'd Code imprest,\nWith all its statutes, on your breast;\nNo duty it enjoins forsook,\nTill Time at length shall close the book;\nAnd hope shall frame, for worlds to come,\nA treaty that survives the tomb."}
