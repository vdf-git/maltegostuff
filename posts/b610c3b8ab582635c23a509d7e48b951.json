{"subject": "Eudoxia.  Second Picture", "text": "O DEAREST my sister, my sister who sits by the hearth, \nWith lids softly drooping, or lifted up saintly and calm, \nWith household hands folded, or opened for help and for balm, \nAnd lips, ripe and dewy, or ready for innocent mirth,-- \nThy life rises upwards to heaven everyday like a psalm \nWhich the singer sings sleeping, and waked, would half wondering say-- \n'I sang not. Nay, how could I sing thus?--I only do pray.' \n\nO gentlest my sister, who walks in at every dark door \nWhether bolted or open, unheedful of welcome or frown; \nBut entering silent as sunlight, and there sitting down, \nIllumines the damp walls and shines pleasant shapes on the floor, \nAnd unlocks dim chambers where low lies sad Hope, without crown, \nUplifts her from sackcloth and ashes and black mourning weeds, \nRe-crowns and re-clothes her.--Then, on to the next door that needs. \n\nO blessed my sister, whose spirit so wholly dost live \nIn loving, that even the word 'loved,' with its rapturous sound, \nRings faintly, like earth-tunes when angels are hymning around: \nWhose eyes say: 'Less happy methinks to receive than to give.'-- \nSo whatsoever we give, may One give to thee without bound, \nAll best gifts--all dearest gifts--whether His right hand do close \nOr open--He holds it forever above thee;--He knows!"}
