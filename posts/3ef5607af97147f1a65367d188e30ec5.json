{"subject": "Sonnet Cxxxvii:", "text": "Ever a darkness somewhere in the sun, \nEver less lustre in the stars at night, \nEver the presence of some deadly blight \nBetwixt my senses and the world will run. \nWeary of woman, sick of man, I shun \nTheir harmless antics and their prattle light, \nAs though the silly things did me despite, \nAnd mocked the misery of a wretch undone. \nIs this a darkness of the heart alone? \nA partial blindness towards the things I see \nNot as they are, but through my fantasy? \nOr was it, Darling, that thy brightness shone \nThe glory that enveloped earth and me, \nWhich now, with thee, is blotted out and gone?"}
