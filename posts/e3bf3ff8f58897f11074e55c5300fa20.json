{"subject": "Severed And Gone", "text": "Severed and gone, so many years!\nAnd art thou still so dear to me,\nThat throbbing heart and burning tears\nCan witness how I cling to thee? \nI know that in the narrow tomb\nThe form I loved was buried deep,\nAnd left, in silence and in gloom,\nTo slumber out its dreamless sleep. \n\nI know the corner where it lies,\nIs but a dreary place of rest:\nThe charnel moisture never dries\nFrom the dark flagstones o'er its breast, \n\nFor there the sunbeams never shine,\nNor ever breathes the freshening air,\n\u00ad- But not for this do I repine;\nFor my beloved is not there. \n\nO, no! I do not think of thee\nAs festering there in slow decay: \u00ad-\n'Tis this sole thought oppresses me,\nThat thou art gone so far away. \n\nFor ever gone; for I, by night,\nHave prayed, within my silent room,\nThat Heaven would grant a burst of light\nIts cheerless darkness to illume; \n\nAnd give thee to my longing eyes,\nA moment, as thou shinest now,\nFresh from thy mansion in the skies,\nWith all its glories on thy brow. \n\nWild was the wish, intense the gaze\nI fixed upon the murky air,\nExpecting, half, a kindling blaze\nWould strike my raptured vision there, -- \n\nA shape these human nerves would thrill,\nA majesty that might appal,\nDid not thy earthly likeness, still,\nGleam softly, gladly, through it all. \n\nFalse hope! vain prayer! it might not be\nThat thou shouldst visit earth again.\nI called on Heaven --\u00ad I called on thee,\nAnd watched, and waited --\u00ad all in vain. \n\nHad I one shining tress of thine,\nHow it would bless these longing eyes!\nOr if thy pictured form were mine,\nWhat gold should rob me of the prize? \n\nA few cold words on yonder stone,\nA corpse as cold as they can be -\u00ad\nVain words, and mouldering dust, alone -\u00ad\nCan this be all that's left of thee? \n\nO, no! thy spirit lingers still\nWhere'er thy sunny smile was seen:\nThere's less of darkness, less of chill\nOn earth, than if thou hadst not been. \n\nThou breathest in my bosom yet,\nAnd dwellest in my beating heart;\nAnd, while I cannot quite forget,\nThou, darling, canst not quite depart. \n\nThough, freed from sin, and grief, and pain\nThou drinkest now the bliss of Heaven,\nThou didst not visit earth in vain;\nAnd from us, yet, thou art not riven. \n\nLife seems more sweet that thou didst live,\nAnd men more true that thou wert one:\nNothing is lost that thou didst give,\nNothing destroyed that thou hast done. \n\nEarth hath received thine earthly part;\nThine heavenly flame has heavenward flown;\nBut both still linger in my heart,\nStill live, and not in mine alone."}
