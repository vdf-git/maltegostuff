{"subject": "Sonet 54", "text": "Great God that guides the Dolphin through the deepe,\nLooke now as thou didst then with smiling grace,\nWhen seeking once her beauties to embrace,\nThou forc'd the faire Amimone to weepe:\nThe liquid monarchie thou canst not keepe,\nIf thus the blustring God vsurp thy place;\nRise and against his blasts erect thy face;\nLet Tritons trumpet sound the seas asleepe,\nWith thine owne armes the wind thy bosome wounds,\nAnd whil'st that it thy followers fall contriues,\nThy Trident to indanger dayly striues,\nAnd desolate would render all thy bounds:\nThen if thou think'st for to preserue thy state,\nLet not such stormes disturb thy watrie seate."}
