{"subject": "A Short Hymn Upon The Birth Of Prince Charles", "text": "You that on Stars do look,\nArrest not there your sight,\nThough Natures fairest Book,\nAnd signed with propitious light;\nOur Blessing now is more Divine,\nThen Planets that at Noon did shine.\n\nTo thee alone be praise,\nFrom whom our Joy descends,\nThou Chearer of our Days,\nOf Causes first, and last of Ends;\nTo thee this May we sing, by whom\nOur Roses from the Lilies bloom.\n\nUpon this Royal Flower,\nSprung from the chastest Bed, \nThy glorious sweetness shower,\nAnd first let Myrtles Crown his Head;\nThen Palms and Lawrels wreath'd between;\nBut let the Cypress late be seen.\n\nAnd so succeeding men,\nWhen they the fulness see\nOf this our Joy, shall then\nIn consort joyn as well as we, \nTo celebrate his Praise above,\nThat spreads our Land with fruits of Love."}
