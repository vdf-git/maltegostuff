{"subject": "The House Of Dust: Part 03: 05: Melody In A Restaurant", "text": "The cigarette-smoke loops and slides above us,\nDipping and swirling as the waiter passes;\nYou strike a match and stare upon the flame.\nThe tiny fire leaps in your eyes a moment,\nAnd dwindles away as silently as it came.\n\nThis melody, you say, has certain voices\u2014\nThey rise like nereids from a river, singing,\nLift white faces, and dive to darkness again.\nWherever you go you bear this river with you:\nA leaf falls,\u2014and it flows, and you have pain.\n\nSo says the tune to you\u2014but what to me?\nWhat to the waiter, as he pours your coffee,\nThe violinist who suavely draws his bow?\nThat man, who folds his paper, overhears it.\nA thousand dreams revolve and fall and flow.\n\nSome one there is who sees a virgin stepping\nDown marble stairs to a deep tomb of roses:\nAt the last moment she lifts remembering eyes.\nGreen leaves blow down.  The place is checked with shadows.\nA long-drawn murmur of rain goes down the skies.\nAnd oaks are stripped and bare, and smoke with lightning:\nAnd clouds are blown and torn upon high forests,\nAnd the great sea shakes its walls.\nAnd then falls silence . . . And through long silence falls\nThis melody once more:\n'Down endless stairs she goes, as once before.'\n\nSo says the tune to him\u2014but what to me?\nWhat are the worlds I see?\nWhat shapes fantastic, terrible dreams? . . .\nI go my secret way, down secret alleys;\nMy errand is not so simple as it seems."}
