{"subject": "The Book Of Joyous Children", "text": "Bound and bordered in leaf-green,\nEdged with trellised buds and flowers\nAnd glad Summer-gold, with clean\nWhite and purple morning-glories\nSuch as suit the songs and stories\nOf this book of ours,\nUnrevised in text or scene,--\nThe Book of Joyous Children.\n\nWild and breathless in their glee--\nLawless rangers of all ways\nWinding through lush greenery\nOf Elysian vales--the viny,\nBowery groves of shady, shiny\nHaunts of childish days.\nSpread and read again with me\nThe Book of Joyous Children.\n\nWhat a whir of wings, and what\nSudden drench of dews upon\nThe young brows, wreathed, all unsought,\nWith the apple-blossom garlands\nOf the poets of those far lands\nWhence all dreams are drawn\nSet herein and soiling not\nThe Book of Joyous Children.\n\nIn their blithe companionship\nTaste again, these pages through,\nThe hot honey on your lip\nOf the sun-smit wild strawberry,\nOr the chill tart of the cherry;\nKneel, all glowing, to\nThe cool spring, and with it sip\nThe Book of Joyous Children.\n\nAs their laughter needs no rule,\nSo accept their language, pray.--\nTouch it not with any tool:\nSurely we may understand it,--\nAs the heart has parsed or scanned it\nIs a worthy way,\nThough found not in any School\nThe Book of Joyous Children.\n\nBe a truant--know no place\nOf prison under heaven's rim!\nFront the Father's smiling face--\nSmiling, that _you_ smile the brighter\nFor the heavy hearts made lighter,\nSince you smile with Him.\nTake--and thank Him for His grace--\nThe Book of Joyous Children."}
