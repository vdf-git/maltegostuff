{"subject": "Merchantmen (1917)", "text": "All honour be to merchantmen,\nAnd ships of all degree,\nIn warlike dangers manifold\nWho sail and keep the sea, -\nIn peril of unlitten coast\nAnd death-besprinkled foam,\nWho daily dare a hundred deaths\nTo bring their cargoes home.\n\nA liner out of Liverpool - a tanker from the Clyde -\nA hard-run tramp from anywhere - a tug from Merseyside -\nA cattle - boat from Birkenhead - a coaler from the Tyne -\nAll honour be to merchantmen while any star shall shine!\n\nAll honour be to merchantmen,\nAnd ships both great and small,\nThe swift and strong to run their race\n(And smite their foes withal),\nThe little ships that sink or swim,\nAnd pay the pirates' toll,\nUnarmoured save by valiant hearts\nAnd strong in nought but soul.\n\nAll honour be to merchantmen\nSo long as tides shall run,\nWho gave the seas their glorious dead\nFrom rise to set of sun;\nAll honour be to merchantmen\nWhile England's name shall stand,\nWho sailed and fought, and dared and died,\nAnd served and saved their land!\n\nA sailing ship from Liverpool - a tanker from the Clyde -\nA schooner from the West Countrie - a tug from Merseyside -\nA fishing smack from Grimsby town - a coaler from the Tyne -\nAll honour be to merchantmen while sun and moon do shine!"}
