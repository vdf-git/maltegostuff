{"subject": "Some Time", "text": "Last night, my darling, as you slept,\n I thought I heard you sigh,\nAnd to your little crib I crept,\n And watched a space thereby;\nAnd then I stooped and kissed your brow,\n For oh! I love you so--\nYou are too young to know it now,\n But some time you shall know!\n\nSome time when, in a darkened place\n Where others come to weep,\nYour eyes shall look upon a face\n Calm in eternal sleep,\nThe voiceless lips, the wrinkled brow,\n The patient smile shall show--\nYou are too young to know it now,\n But some time you may know!\n\nLook backward, then, into the years,\n And see me here to-night--\nSee, O my darling! how my tears\n Are falling as I write;\nAnd feel once more upon your brow\n The kiss of long ago--\nYou are too young to know it now,\n But some time you shall know."}
