{"subject": "The Passions", "text": "An Ode for Music\n\nWhen Music, heavenly maid, was young,\nWhile yet in early Greece she sung,\nThe Passions oft, to hear her shell,\nThronged around her magic cell,\nExulting, trembling, raging, fainting,\nPossest beyond the Muse's painting:\nBy turns they felt the glowing mind\nDisturbed, delighted, raised, refined;\nTill once, 'tis said, when all were fired,\nFilled with fury, rapt, inspired,\nFrom the supporting myrtles round\nThey snatched her instruments of sound,\nAnd, as they oft had heard apart\nSweet lessons of her forceful art,\nEach (for Madness ruled the hour)\nWould prove his own expressive power.\n\nFirst Fear his hand, its skill to try,\nAmid the chords bewildered laid,\nAnd back recoiled, he knew not why,\nE'en at the sound himself had made.\n\nNext Anger rushed, his eyes on fire,\nIn lightnings owned his secret stings:\nIn one rude clash he struck the lyre,\nAnd swept with hurried hand the strings.\n\nWith woful measures wan Despair\nLow sullen sounds his grief beguiled;\nA solemn, strange, and mingled air,\n'Twas sad by fits, by starts 'twas wild.\n\nBut thou, O Hope, with eyes so fair,\nWhat was thy delighted measure?\nStill it whispered promised pleasure,\nAnd bade the lovely scenes at distance hail!\nStill would her touch the strain prolong;\nAnd from the rocks, the woods, the vale,\nShe called on Echo still, through all the song,\nAnd, where her sweetest theme she chose,\nA soft responsive voice was heard at every close;\nAnd Hope enchanted smiled, and waved her golden hair.\nAnd longer had she sung;\u2014but, with a frown,\nRevenge impatient rose:\nHe threw his blood-stained sword in thunder down;\nAnd, with a withering look,\nThe war-denouncing trumpet took,\nAnd blew a blast so loud and dread,\nWere ne'er prophetic sounds so full of woe!\nAnd ever and anon he beat\nThe doubling drum with furious heat;\nAnd though sometimes each dreary pause between\nDejected Pity, at his side,\nHer soul-subduing voice applied,\nYet still he kept his wild unaltered mien,\nWhile each strained ball of sight seemed bursting from his head.\nThy numbers, Jealousy, to nought were fixed:\nSad proof of thy distressful state!\nOf differing themes the veering song was mixed;\nAnd now it courted Love, now raving called on Hate.\nWith eyes up-raised, as one inspired,\nPale Melancholy sat retired;\nAnd from her wild sequestered seat,\nIn notes, by distance made more sweet,\nPoured through the mellow horn her pensive soul;\nAnd, dashing soft from rocks around,\nBubbling runnels joined the sound;\nThrough glades and glooms the mingled measure stole,\nOr, o'er some haunted stream, with fond delay,\nRound an holy calm diffusing,\nLove of Peace, and lonely musing,\nIn hollow murmurs died away.\nBut Oh! how altered was its sprightlier tone\nWhen Cheerfulness, a nymph of healthiest hue,\nHer bow across her shoulder flung,\nHer buskins gemmed with morning dew,\nBlew an inspiring air that dale and thicket rung\nThe hunter's call, to Faun and Dryad known!\nThe oak-crowned Sisters, and their chaste-eyed Queen,\nSatyrs and Sylvan Boys, were seen\nPeeping from forth their alleys green:\nBrown Exercise rejoiced to hear;\nAnd Sport leapt up, and seized his beechen spear.\nLast came Joy's ecstatic trial:\nHe, with viny crown advancing,\nFirst to the lively pipe his hand addrest;\nBut soon he saw the brisk awakening viol,\nWhose sweet entrancing voice he loved the best:\nThey would have thought who heard the strain\nThey saw, in Tempe's vale, her native maids\nAmidst the festal-sounding shades\nTo some unwearied minstrel dancing,\nWhile, as his flying fingers kissed the strings,\nLove framed with Mirth a gay fantastic round:\nLoose were her tresses seen, her zone unbound;\nAnd he, amidst his frolic play,\nAs if he would the charming air repay,\nShook thousand odours from his dewy wings.\n\nO Music, sphere-descended maid,\nFriend of Pleasure, Wisdom's aid!\nWhy, goddess, why, to us denied,\nLay'st thou thy ancient lyre aside?\nAs, in that loved Athenian bower,\nYou learned an all-commanding power,\nThy mimic soul, O Nymph endeared,\nCan well recall what then it heard;\nWhere is thy native simple heart,\nDevote to Virtue, Fancy, Art?\nArise, as in that elder time,\nWarm, energetic, chaste, sublime!\nThy wonders, in that godlike age,\nFill thy recording Sister's page\u2014 \n'Tis said, and I believe the tale,\nThy humblest reed could more prevail,\nHad more of strength, diviner rage,\nThan all which charms this laggard age;\nE'en all at once together found\nCecilia's mingled world of sound\u2014 \nO! bid our vain endeavours cease:\nRevive the just designs of Greece:\nReturn in all thy simple state!\nConfirm the tales her sons relate!"}
