{"subject": "Montreal", "text": "Reign on, majestic Ville-Marie!\nSpread wide thy ample robes of state;\nThe heralds cry that thou art great,\nAnd proud are thy young sons of thee.\nMistress of half a continent,\nThou risest from thy girlhood's rest;\nWe see thee conscious heave thy breast\nAnd feel thy rank and thy descent.\nSpring of the saint and chevalier!\nAnd with the Scarlet Tunic wed!\nMount Royal's crown upon thy head;\nAnd past thy footstool, broad and clear,\nSaint Lawrence sweeping to the sea:\nReign on, majestic Ville-Marie!"}
