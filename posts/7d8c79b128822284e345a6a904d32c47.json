{"subject": "Rothko Via Muncie, Indiana", "text": "The 1980s. Beginning of the long decade, the century's\nlate works. Snow on the grid, field bisected\nby a late model John Deere's progress in low gear\nwith a front-end load of straw bales. Its operator's daughter\ndons her brace, thinks her scoliosis the devil's work\non her, a not-good-enough Christian. Her mother talks\nscripture on the phone in the kitchen and the kitchen\nsmells of coffee and it smells of dog. Christmas lights \n\nstrung along the eaves of bungalows, vehicles moored \nto bungalows by their block heater cords. Rumours\t\nof drunkenness and corruption sunk the Democrat's bid\nfor mayor. For we favour the simple expression of the complex \nthought. The large shape's impact of the unequivocal. Flat forms\nthat destroy illusion, reveal truth. Now the union's eye \nhas twilight in it, and the city dump will stay where it is. \nEvening falls, or rises, or emanates from the figures. \nThe SportsPlex and Model Aviation Museum, the Muncie \nMall and both quadrangles of Ball State University \nshed their associations, perform an unknown adventure \nin unknown space. Halogens illuminate an anecdote \nof the spirit. You won't see his face around here again. \nThe violet quarry hosts a greater darkness further in,\nthe White River sleeps in its cabin of pack ice.\nAmong the graduating class an abstract feeling develops, \n\nan inclination to symbolism born of the fatal car wreck on \nNew Year's, a spike in requests for Bob Seger \nto the call-ins from a quasi-religious experience of limitless \nimmensity. To achieve this clarity is inevitably \nto be misunderstood. Their lives take on the dimensions\nof the fields, the city, its facades and its plan, whose happiness \nwill be their own. Rent, food budget, sweaters \nindoors. Basketball, basketball, and a second marriage."}
