{"subject": "A Worn-Out Pencil", "text": "Welladay!\nHere I lay\nYou at rest--all worn away,\nO my pencil, to the tip\nOf our old companionship!\n\nMemory\nSighs to see\nWhat you are, and used to be,\nLooking backward to the time\nWhen you wrote your earliest rhyme!--\n\nWhen I sat\nFiling at\nYour first point, and dreaming that\nYour initial song should be\nWorthy of posterity.\n\nWith regret\nI forget\nIf the song be living yet,\nYet remember, vaguely now,\nIt was honest, anyhow.\n\nYou have brought\nMe a thought--\nTruer yet was never taught,--\nThat the silent song is best,\nAnd the unsung worthiest.\n\nSo if I,\nWhen I die,\nMay as uncomplainingly\nDrop aside as now you do,\nWrite of me, as I of you:--\n\nHere lies one\nWho begun\nLife a-singing, heard of none;\nAnd he died, satisfied,\nWith his dead songs by his side."}
