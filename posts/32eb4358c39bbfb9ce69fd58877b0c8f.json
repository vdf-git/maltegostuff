{"subject": "Sunt Leones", "text": "The lions who ate the Christians on the sands of the arena\nBy indulging native appetites played was now been seen a\nNot entirely negligible part\nIn consolidating at the very start\nThe position of the Early Christian Church.\nInitiatory rights are always bloody\nIn the lions, it appears\nFrom contemporary art, made a study\nOf dyeing Coliseum sands a ruddy\nLiturgically sacrificial hue\nAnd if the Christians felt a little blue-\nWill people being eaten often do.\nTheirs was the death, and there's was a crown undying,\nA state of things which must be satisfying.\nMy point which up to this has been obscured\nIs that it was the lions who procured\nBy chewing up blood gristle flesh and bone\nThe martyrdoms on which the church has grown.\nI only write this poem because I thought it rather looked\nAs if the part the lions played was being overlooked.\nBy lions' jaws great benefits and blessings were begotten\nAnd so our debt to Lionhood must never be forgotten."}
