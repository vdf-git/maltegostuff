{"subject": "My Lady Nightingale", "text": "I heard you singing in the grove,\nMy Lady Nightingale;\nThe thirsty leaves were drinking dew,\nAnd all the sky was pale.\n\nA silence-clear as bells of peace\nYour song thrilled on the air,\nEach liquid note a thing of joy,\nAnd sweet beyond compare.\n\nNot all of joy-a haunting strain\nOf sorrow and of tears,\nA note of grief which seemed to voice\nThe sadness of the years.\n\n'Twas pure, 'twas clear, 'twas wondrous sweet,\nMy Lady Nightingale,\nYet subtly sad, the song you sang\nWhen all the sky was pale."}
