{"subject": "Lie-A-Bed", "text": "My darling lies down in her soft white bed, \nAnd she laughs at me. \nHer laughter has flushed her pale cheeks with red. \nHer eyes dance with glee. \nMy darling lies close in her warm white bed, \nAnd she will not rise. \nI will shower kisses down on her sleepyhead \nTill she close her eyes. \nGioja's no happier fresh from the South. \nBut my kisses free \nWill straiten the curves of this teasing mouth, \nIf it laughs at me."}
