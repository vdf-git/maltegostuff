{"subject": "The Choice", "text": "Think thou and act; to-morrow thou shalt die.\nOutstretch\u2019d in the sun\u2019s warmth upon the shore,\nThou say\u2019st: \u2018Man\u2019s measured path is all gone o\u2019er:\nUp all his years, steeply, with strain and sigh,\nMan clomb until he touch\u2019d the truth; and I,\nEven I, am he whom it was destined for.\u2019\nHow should this be? Art thou then so much more\nThan they who sow\u2019d, that thou shouldst reap thereby?\n\nNay, come up hither. From this wave-wash\u2019d mound\nUnto the furthest flood-brim look with me;\nThen reach on with thy thought till it be drown\u2019d.\nMiles and miles distant though the last line be,\nAnd though thy soul sail leagues and leagues beyond,\u2014\nStill, leagues beyond those leagues, there is more sea."}
