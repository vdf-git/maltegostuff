{"subject": "Elegant Morning", "text": "The street looks like eternal Sunday.\nLightly summerhouse rests against summerhouse.\nChauffeurs wheel by grandly.\nThree fine citizens glide by quietly.\nA song flies coolly out a window.\nFrom a distance the wind carries a child's shout.\nAnd in front of the villa of a duke stands,\nAll dressed up, like a stiff doll,\nIn a brightly colored scarf, red as a poppy,\nThe royal Bavarian legal apprentice,\nDoctor of Jurisprudence Kuno Kohn."}
