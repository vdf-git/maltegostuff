{"subject": "Tyne Dock", "text": "The summer season at Tyne Dock\nHoisted my boyhood in a crane\nAbove the shaggy mining town,\nAbove the slaghills and the rocks,\nAbove the middens in backlanes\nAnd wooden hen-huts falling down.\n\nVermilion grass grew in the street\nWhere the blind pit-ponies pranced\nAnd poppies screamed by butchers' stalls\nWhere bulls kicked sparks with dying feet,\nAnd in the naked larks I sensed\nA cruel god beneath it all.\n\nOver the pit-head wheel the moon\nWas clean as a girl's face in school;\nI envied the remote old man\nWho lived there, happy and alone,\nWhile in the kitchen the mad spool\nUnwound as Annie's treadle ran.\n\nThe boyish season is still there\nFor clapping hands and leaping feet\nAcross the slagheaps and the dunes;\nAnd still it breaks into my care,\nThough I will never find the street,\nNor catch the old, impulsive tune,\nNor ever lose that child's despair."}
