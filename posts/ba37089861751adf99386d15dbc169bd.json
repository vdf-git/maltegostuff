{"subject": "February Morning", "text": "Peacefully fresh, O February morn,\nThy winds come to me: quiet the light slants\nThrough silver--bosomed clouds, that slowly borne\nAcross the wide heath, endlessly advance.\n\nNow 'tis that pause before the leaping Spring,\nWhen over all things waiting comes a hush;\nAnd shyly, listen! the one vocal thing,\nOver his dewy notes lingers the thrush.\n\nNow life, with all her hindering riddles, seems\nSimple as its green budding to the tree.\nAwhile the Fates forbear, and to my dreams,\nSheltered awhile from truth, relinquish me.\n\nIn haven and at anchor rides my heart,\nAnd broods upon its swelling joys apart."}
