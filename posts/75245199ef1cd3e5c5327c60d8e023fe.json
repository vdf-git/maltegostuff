{"subject": "Half-Waking", "text": "I thought it was the little bed \n       I slept in long ago; \n   A straight white curtain at the head, \n       And two smooth knobs below. \n   I thought I saw the nursery fire, \n       And in a chair well-known \n   My mother sat, and did not tire \n       With reading all alone. \n   If I should make the slightest sound \n       To show that I'm awake, \n   She'd rise, and lap the blankets round, \n       My pillow softly shake; \n   Kiss me, and turn my face to see \n       The shadows on the wall, \n   And then sing Rousseau's Dream to me, \n       Till fast asleep I fall. \n   But this is not my little bed; \n       That time is far away; \n   With strangers now I live instead, \n       From dreary day to day."}
