{"subject": "Sonnet 91: Stella While Now", "text": "Stella, while now by honor's cruel might, \nI am from you, light of my life, mis-led, \nAnd that fair you, my Sun, thus overspread \nWith absence' veil, I live in sorrow's night; \n\nIf this dark place yet show like candle light \nSome beauty's piece, as amber-color'd head, \nMilk hands, rose cheeks, or lips more sweet, more red, \nOr seeing jet's black but in blackness bright. \n\nThey please, I do confess; they please mine eyes, \nBut why? Because of you they models be, \nModels such be wood globes of glist'ring skies. \n\nDear, therefore be not jealous over me, \nIf you hear that they seem my heart to move. \nNot them, oh no, but you in them I love."}
