{"subject": "My Lost Youth", "text": "Often I think of the beautiful town\nThat is seated by the sea;\nOften in thought go up and down\nThe pleasant streets of that dear old town,\nAnd my youth comes back to me. \nAnd a verse of a Lapland song\nIs haunting my memory still:\n\"A boy's will is the wind's will,\nAnd the thoughts of youth are long, long thoughts.\"\n\nI can see the shadowy lines of its trees,\nAnd catch, in sudden gleams,\nThe sheen of the far-surrounding seas,\nAnd islands that were the Hesperides\nOf all my boyish dreams.\nAnd the burden of that old song,\nIt murmurs and whispers still:\n\"A boy's will is the wind's will,\nAnd the thoughts of youth are long, long thoughts.\"\n\nI remember the black wharves and the ships,\nAnd the sea-tides tossing free;\nAnd Spanish sailors with bearded lips,\nAnd the beauty and mystery of the ships,\nAnd the magic of the sea.\nAnd the voice of that wayward song\nIs singing and saying still:\n\"A boy's will is the wind's will,\nAnd the thoughts of youth are long, long thoughts.\"\n\nI remember the bulwarks by the shore,\nAnd the fort upon the hill;\nThe sunrise gun, with its hollow roar,\nThe drum-beat repeated o'er and o'er,\nAnd the bugle wild and shrill.\nAnd the music of that old song\nThrobs in my memory still:\n\"A boy's will is the wind's will,\nAnd the thoughts of youth are long, long thoughts.\"\n\nI remember the sea-fight far away,\nHow it thundered o'er the tide!\nAnd the dead captains, as they lay\nIn their graves, o'erlooking the tranquil bay\nWhere they in battle died.\nAnd the sound of that mournful song\nGoes through me with a thrill:\n\"A boy's will is the wind's will,\nAnd the thoughts of youth are long, long thoughts.\"\n\nI can see the breezy dome of groves,\nThe shadows of Deering's Woods;\nAnd the friendships old and the early loves\nCome back with a Sabbath sound, as of doves\nIn quiet neighborhoods.\nAnd the verse of that sweet old song,\nIt flutters and murmurs still:\n\"A boy's will is the wind's will,\nAnd the thoughts of youth are long, long thoughts.\"\n\nI remember the gleams and glooms that dart\nAcross the school-boy's brain;\nThe song and the silence in the heart,\nThat in part are prophecies, and in part\nAre longings wild and vain.\nAnd the voice of that fitful song\nSings on, and is never still:\n\"A boy's will is the wind's will,\nAnd the thoughts of youth are long, long thoughts.\"\n\nThere are things of which I may not speak;\nThere are dreams that cannot die;\nThere are thoughts that make the strong heart weak,\nAnd bring a pallor into the cheek,\nAnd a mist before the eye.\nAnd the words of that fatal song\nCome over me like a chill:\n\"A boy's will is the wind's will,\nAnd the thoughts of youth are long, long thoughts.\"\n\nStrange to me now are the forms I meet\nWhen I visit the dear old town;\nBut the native air is pure and sweet,\nAnd the trees that o'ershadow each well-known street,\nAs they balance up and down,\nAre singing the beautiful song,\nAre sighing and whispering still:\n\"A boy's will is the wind's will,\nAnd the thoughts of youth are long, long thoughts.\"\n\nAnd Deering's Woods are fresh and fair,\nAnd with joy that is almost pain\nMy heart goes back to wander there,\nAnd among the dreams of the days that were,\nI find my lost youth again.\nAnd the strange and beautiful song,\nThe groves are repeating it still:\n\"A boy's will is the wind's will,\nAnd the thoughts of youth are long, long thoughts.\""}
