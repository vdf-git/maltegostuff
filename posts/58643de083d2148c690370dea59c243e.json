{"subject": "Fatherless", "text": "I've had no man \nTo guard and shelter me, \nGuide and instruct me \nFrom mine infancy. \nNo lord of earth \nTo show me day by day \nWhat things a girl should do \nAnd what she should say. \nI have gone free \nOf manly excellence \nAnd hold their wisdom \nMore than half pretence. \nFor since no male \nHas ruled me or has fed, \nI think my own thoughts \nIn my woman's head."}
