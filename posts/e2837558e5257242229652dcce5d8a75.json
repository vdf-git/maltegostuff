{"subject": "Nature and the revolution", "text": "That week several sightings of flying saucers were reported,\nand auroras of the invisible universe.\nI was in my car, and passed an unusual religious ritual\nwhile rain poured down on a fractured dusk.\nThe men wore veils, except the two initiates;\na small choir of women enraptured on the roadside. \nI had never seen this sect, a mixture of Africa and the West.\nThe veiled men urgently egged on the novices, who were sweating and crying,\nto walk faster to the altar, and the new life awaiting them.\nBlinded by fervour they shuffled like ducks into the veld\nand fell to their knees, praying out loud. Two shots rang out.\nI'd witnessed a car being hijacked, and summary execution.\nHow was I to know? There is hardly a road going anywhere\nthat does not also lead in the opposite direction.\nMaybe it's something to do with perception.\nSome believe flying saucers are visions of the future\nor of an advanced civilisation that perished in the past.\nTake that story of the two brides for instance.\nThere's the slow bride, whose single gesture can take three generations.\nHer dress doesn't flutter, its frills\nare embossed in the pressed ceiling above me.\nAnd the fast bride, unwrapped on the spot, wet before the ceremony's over.\nShe has a long bridal train, white, and humbly calls herself toilet paper.\nMaybe things are determined by how we view time.\nAnd if you think I was a bad witness, remember circumcision\nor sacrificial virgins. The quick hand and the slow hand, of God.\nYes, I might have been more useful to the enquiry.\nYes I'm glad, still to be among the living.\nBut idling past in my car in a time of apparitions,\non the right side of the road, on the good side\nof the line, they didn't see me. I was the one\nwho didn't exist yet."}
