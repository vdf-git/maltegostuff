Let's meet at dawn\nin the park to practice an ancient art\nwhile people roll by in the latest\nspace-age gear blank as mirrors\nabove the procedure in the stainless\nsteel theaters where paper-gowned\nwe take ourselves to take ourselves\napart. Tap-tap-spark. So little blazes.\nCover the roofs with precision hooves.\nPush back the forest like a blanket.\nA bird the right color is invisible,\nonly movement catches the eye.\nMy most illustrious Lord, I know\nhow to remove water from moats\nand how to make an infinite number\nof bridges. Here we are at the palace.\nHere we are in the dark, dark woods."}
