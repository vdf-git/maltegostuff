{"subject": "The Lost Piece Of Silver", "text": "HOLY Lord Jesus, Thou wilt search till Thou find \nThis lost piece of silver,--this treasure enshrined \nIn casket or bosom, once of such store; \nNow lying under the dust of Thy floor. \n\nGentle Lord Jesus, Thou wilt move through the room-- \nSo empty--so desolate! and light up its gloom: \nThe lost piece of silver that no man can see, \nMerciful Jesus! is beheld clear by Thee. \n\nDefaced and degraded, trampled in the dust, \nIts superscription Thou knowest still we trust: \nAnd Thou wilt uplift it and make it re-shine, \nFor it was silver--pure silver of Thine. \n\nLoving Lord Jesus, Thou wilt come through the dark, \nWhen men are all sleeping and no eye can mark. \nThough 'clean forgotten, like a dead man out of mind,' \nThis lost piece of silver Thou wilt search for--and find."}
