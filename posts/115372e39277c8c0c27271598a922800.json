{"subject": "The Brown Wind Of Connaught", "text": "The brown wind of Connaught\u2013\nAcross the bogland blown,\n(The brown wind of Connaught ),\nTurns my heart to a stone;\nFor it cries my name at twilight,\nAnd cries it at the noon\u2013\nO, Mairgread B\u00e1n! O, Mairgread B\u00e1n!\nJust like a fairy tune. \n\nThe brown wind of Connaught,\nWhen Dermot came to woo,\n(The brown wind of Connaught ),\nIt heard his whispers too;\nAnd while my wheel goes whirring,\nIt taps on my window-pane,\nTill I open wide to the Dead outside,\nAnd the sea-salt misty rain. \n\nThe Brown wind of Connaught\nWith women wailed one day\n(The brown wind of Connaught ),\nFor a wreck in Galway Bay;\nAnd many the dark-faced fishers\nThat gathered their nets in fear,\nBut one sank straight to the Ghostly Gate\u2013\nAnd he was my Dermot Dear. \n\nThe brown wind of Connaught\nStill keening in the dawn,\n(The brown wind of Connaught ),\nFor my true love long gone.\nOh, cold green wave of danger,\nDrift him a restful sleep\nO'er his young black head on its lowly bed,\nWhile his weary wake I keep."}
