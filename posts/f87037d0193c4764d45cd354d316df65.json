{"subject": "Zermatt To The Matterhorn.", "text": "Thirty-two years since, up against the sun, \nSeven shapes, thin atomies to lower sight, \nLabouringly leapt and gained thy gabled height, \nAnd four lives paid for what the seven had won. \n\nThey were the first by whom the deed was done, \nAnd when I look at thee, my mind takes flight \nTo that day's tragic feat of manly might, \nAs though, till then, of history thou hadst none. \n\nYet ages ere men topped thee, late and soon \nThou watch'dst each night the planets lift and lower; \nThou gleam'dst to Joshua's pausing sun and moon, \nAnd brav'dst the tokening sky when Caesar's power \nApproached its bloody end:  yea, saw'st that Noon \nWhen darkness filled the earth till the ninth hour."}
