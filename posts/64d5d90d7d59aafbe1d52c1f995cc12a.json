{"subject": "Friendship", "text": "Friendship is that pure hallow'd light\nThat warms-but burns not with its rays ;\nIt is not passion's maddening flight -\nIt is not frenzy's frantic blaze.\n\nIt is the day-beam of the soul -\nThe calm content within the breast-\nEach angry passion to control,\nAnd lull each anxious care to rest.\n\nAs flies the magnet to the pole -\nThe same in darkness clouds and dearth,\nSo turns congenial soul to soul,\nAnd Friendship's sunny light hath birth.\n\nAnd when our course is nearly done,\nAnd all our earthly trials past,\nWe turn to Friendship's setting sun,\nAnd see it smiling to the last."}
