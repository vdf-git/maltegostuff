{"subject": "The Merman", "text": "Who would be\nA merman bold,\nSitting alone,\nSinging alone\nUnder the sea,\nWith a crown of gold,\nOn a throne?\n\nI would be a merman bold,\nI would sit and sing the whole of the day;\nI would fill the sea-halls with a voice of power;\nBut at night I would roam abroad and play\nWith the mermaids in and out of the rocks,\nDressing their hair with the white sea-flower;\nAnd holding them back by their flowing locks\nI would kiss them often under the sea,\nAnd kiss them again till they kiss'd me\nLaughingly, laughingly;\nAnd then we would wander away, away,\nTo the pale-green sea-groves straight and high,\nChasing each other merrily.\n\nThere would be neither moon nor star;\nBut the wave would make music above us afar \u2014\nLow thunder and light in the magic night \u2014\nNeither moon nor star.\nWe would call aloud in the dreamy dells,\nCall to each other and whoop and cry\nAll night, merrily, merrily;\nThey would pelt me with starry spangles and shells,\nLaughing and clapping their hands between,\nAll night, merrily, merrily,\nBut I would throw to them back in mine\nTurkis and agate and almondine;\nThen leaping out upon them unseen\nI would kiss them often under the sea,\nAnd kiss them again till they kiss'd me\nLaughingly, laughingly.\nOh! what a happy life were mine\nUnder the hollow-hung ocean green!\nSoft are the moss-beds under the sea;\nWe would live merrily, merrily."}
