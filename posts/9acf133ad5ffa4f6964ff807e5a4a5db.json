{"subject": "It's Lifted Up", "text": "It's lifted up - this iron pole -  \nOver our cursed heads, And we\nAre flying o'er the abyss, awful,\nThrough space where none can something see.\n\nBut stronger are the winds, us bear,\nAnd closer the sad end of race,\nThe more dazzling is and clearer\nSeen the sweet shining of Her face.\n\nAnd through the vortical rotation,\nShowing self to the woe's sons,\nLeads them into the endless azure\nThe half-distinguishable path."}
