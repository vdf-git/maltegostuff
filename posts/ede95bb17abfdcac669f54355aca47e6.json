{"subject": "Song The Eigth", "text": "Cape on the waves! In sucking caves\nThe seething pots of ocean boil:\nGood ship and true, they suck not you,\nHome plunging in your honest toil.\n\nUp in yon sweet blue fluency of air,\nOur mountain trees, greening of dewy light,\nStand in their prosperous height:\nFinch, merle, and throstle pipe their morning quarrel there.\n\nSummer secrets here they be\nTangled deepest: Shy of view,\nThe woodman lorn holds, beast and bird, with you\nThe wild unwritten by-law, large and lax,\u2014\nGuild of the forest free.\nDown in the sounding wood there goes his vehement axe.\n\nHome, red with earth, the weary hind\nPlods through the thistly stubbles wide.\nShrill birds hang wavering down the wind.\nThe miry hunters homeward ride."}
