{"subject": "Expectation", "text": "Come while the afternoon of May \nIs sweet with many a lilac-spray, \nCome while the sparrows chirping fare \nFrom branch to branch across the square. \n\nCome like the dawn and bring to me \nThe fresh winds of an open sea, \nCome like the stars of night and bear \nAll consolation in thine hair. \n\nBring me release from ancient pain, \nBring me the hopes of joy found vain, \nBring me thy sweetness of the dove, \nCome, sweet, and bring thyself and love!"}
