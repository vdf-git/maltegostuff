{"subject": "Beloved", "text": "As music out of silence, Craig, so came\nThy love from mystery; so, darling, now\nThe lilies are less radiant than thy brow,\nOn which my heart beholds celestial flame.\nThou art all white, my queen; there is no name\nIn all the lore of love for such as thou;\nThe moon s wan breast, the foam beneath the prow,\nThe cherry bloom\u2014thou bringest them to shame!\n\nThou art too fair! How shall I worship thee,\nThou sister of the dawn? How cry thy praise?\nNay! tho' I sing thro' many dusks and days\nI cannot tell with words thy gift to me,\nWho, ere Heaven's crystal gleamed beneath my feet,\nHast made the tale of all its bliss complete."}
