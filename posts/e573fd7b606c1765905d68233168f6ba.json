{"subject": "The Great And Little Weavers", "text": "The great and the little weavers,\n   They neither rest nor sleep.\n   They work in the height and the glory,\n   They toil in the dark and the deep.\n   The rainbow melts with the shower,\n   The white-thorn falls in the gust,\n   The cloud-rose dies into shadow,\n   The earth-rose dies into dust.\n   But they have not faded forever,\n  They have not flowered in vain,\n  For the great and the little weavers\n  Are weaving under the rain.\n\n  Recede the drums of the thunder\n  When the Titan chorus tires,\n  And the bird-song piercing the sunset\n  Faints with the sunset fires,\n\n  But the trump of the storm shall fail not,\n  Nor the flute-cry fail of the thrush,\n  For the great and the little weavers\n  Are weaving under the hush.\n\n  The comet flares into darkness,\n  The flame dissolves into death,\n  The power of the star and the dew\n  They glow and are gone like a breath,\n\n  But ere the old wonder is done\n  Is the new-old wonder begun,\n  For the great and the little weavers\n  Are weaving under the sun.\n\n  The domes of an empire crumble,\n  A child's hope dies in tears;\n  Time rolls them away forgotten\n  In the silt of the flooding years;\n\n  The creed for which men died smiling\n  Decays to a beldame's curse;\n  The love that made lips immortal\n  Drags by in a tattered hearse.\n\n  But not till the search of the moon\n  Sees the last white face uplift,\n  And over the bones of the kindreds\n  The bare sands dredge and drift,\n\n  Shall Love forget to return\n  And lift the unused latch,\n  (In his eyes the look of the traveller,\n  On his lips the foreign catch),\n\n  Nor the mad song leave men cold,\n  Nor the high dream summon in vain, --\n  For the great and the little weavers\n  Are weaving in heart and brain."}
