{"subject": "What Dark Days Do", "text": "I sorter like a gloomy day,\nTh' kind that jest _won't_ smile;\nIt makes a feller hump hisself\nT' make life seem wuth while.\nWhen sun's a-shinin' an' th' sky\nIs washed out bright an' gay,\nIt ain't no job to whistle--but\nIt is--\nWhen skies air gray!\n\nSo gloomy days air good fer us,\nThey make us look about\nTo find our blessin's--make us count\nThe friends who never doubt,\nMost any one kin smile and joke\nAnd hold blue-devils back\nWhen it is bright, but we must work\nT' grin--\nWhen skies air black!\n\nThat's why I sorter _like_ dark days,\nThat put it up to me\nTo keep th' gloom from soakin' in\nMy whole anatomy!\nAn' if they _never_ come along\nMy soul would surely rust--\nTh' dark days keeps my cheerfulness\nFrom draggin'\nIn th' dust!"}
