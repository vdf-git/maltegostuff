{"subject": "Jekyl Island", "text": "EBB-TIDE \n\nFADING light on a lonely beach, \nA slow out-creeping tide \nThat leaves to me on sea-etched sands \nThe ocean's cryptic speech. \n\nAdown the ever broadening strand \nMoon-witched waters steal, \nAnd over the dunes a wild wind swoops \nAnd frets the silted sand."}
