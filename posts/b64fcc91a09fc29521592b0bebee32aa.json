{"subject": "The Bangle Sellers", "text": "Bangle sellers are we who bear\nOur shining loads to the temple fair...\nWho will buy these delicate, bright\nRainbow-tinted circles of light?\nLustrous tokens of radiant lives,\nFor happy daughters and happy wives.\n\nSome are meet for a maiden's wrist,\nSilver and blue as the mountain mist,\nSome are flushed like the buds that dream\nOn the tranquil brow of a woodland stream,\nSome are aglow wth the bloom that cleaves\nTo the limpid glory of new born leaves\n\nSome are like fields of sunlit corn,\nMeet for a bride on her bridal morn,\nSome, like the flame of her marriage fire,\nOr, rich with the hue of her heart's desire,\nTinkling, luminous, tender, and clear,\nLike her bridal laughter and bridal tear.\n\nSome are purple and gold flecked grey\nFor she who has journeyed through life midway,\nWhose hands have cherished, whose love has blest,\nAnd cradled fair sons on her faithful breast,\nAnd serves her household in fruitful pride,\nAnd worships the gods at her husband's side."}
