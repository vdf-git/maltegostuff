{"subject": "The Sanctuary", "text": "IF I could keep my innermost Me\nFearless, aloof and free\nOf the least breath of love or hate,\nAnd not disconsolate\nAt the sick load of sorrow laid on men;\nIf I could keep a sanctuary there\nFree even of prayer,\nIf I could do this, then,\nWith quiet candor as I grew more wise\nI could look even at God with grave forgiving eyes."}
