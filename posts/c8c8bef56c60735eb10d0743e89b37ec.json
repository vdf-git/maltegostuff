{"subject": "The Swifts (1)", "text": "The swifts have no strength any more to retain, \nTo check the light-blue evening coolness. \nIt burst from their breasts, from their throats, under strain \nAnd flows out of hand in its fullness. \n\nThere is not a thing that could stop them, up there, \nFrom shrilly, exultedly crying, \nExclaiming: The earth has made off to nowhere, \nO look! It has vanished - O triumph! \n\nAs cauldrons of water are ended in steam \nWhen quarrelsome bubbles are rising - \nLook - there is no room for the earth - from the seam \nOf the gorge to the drawn-out horizon!"}
