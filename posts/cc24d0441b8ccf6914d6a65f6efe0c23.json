{"subject": "The Space Age", "text": "The underground, the underground, it drives me to despair \nI cannot even estimate the cost in wear and tear \nIt's packed to full capacity, I never get a seat,  \nIn fact, there's barely room enough for me to put my feet. I try my best to hold the strap, but that's no good at all \nYou see, I cannot reach, because I'm barely five feet tall \nI rock and roll and toss about as if I'm on a boat \nAnd suddenly I feel an arm stretched out across my throat. You may think I exaggerate when telling of my woes, \nBut worse things have befallen me than treading on my toes. \nIn fact, one day I turned my head and found to my dismay \nThere wasn't room to turn it back, so there it had to stay. If only one could board a train and find a cosy nook, \nIn which to sit in comfort, have a snooze or read a book, \nOr take time off for silent thought and thus prepare the way \nin calmness and serenity, to meet the coming day."}
