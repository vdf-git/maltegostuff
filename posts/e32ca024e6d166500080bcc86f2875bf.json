{"subject": "When Skeletons Make Love", "text": "After a meditation by Susannah Carleton\n\nWhen skeletons make love,\nDo they look into each other's eye\nSockets and see their own reflection?\n\nDoes the smell of cherry pie\nCooling by an open window\nRemind them of red organs?\n\nDo they exchange gifts of malas\nMade of dried hair strung through\nCavities once filled with gold?\n\nWhen skeletons make love,\nDoes it hurt the first time?\nDo wives and husbands\n\nSlowly wear each other down,\nGrinding their love to a place\nWhere there is no bone?\n\nDo they notice swooping bats,\nFlying through their ribs\nWhen they make love?\n\nDo skeletons make love in an\nEmbrace that begins with the\nIdea of my skull/your skull,\n\nAnd ends not knowing whose\nSkull is whose, and sometimes\nWith no skull at all,\n\nOr with their lover's skull\nWhere their pelvis had been\nAnd their pelvis where\n\nTheir lover's head once was?\nIs this the essence of why they\nMake love, these skeletons?\n\nWhen skeletons make love,\nDo they feel it is a piece of the\nOld lost world returning?\n\nIs it the part that is like running\nInto one problem after another,\nBuried in debt and broken\n\nMachinery, body pains and\nThe ongoing anguish waiting to\nBring a person down\n\nOr tangle them up?\nWhen skeletons make love\nDo they wish to be dead\n\nOr just in bed, lights out,\nNext to each other, panting,\nThen relaxed breathing?\n\nDoes it matter that they are\nEmpty vessels of the evaporated\nFluids that contained them?\n\nDo they receive food from\nOne another, only to ask,\n\"Where's the water?\"\n\nWhen skeletons make love,\nIt is as unavoidable as an extinct\nTree, a shoulder blade,\n\nSummoned from another\nDimension- Boneholders,\nBlessed with the world's trust.\n\nWhen skeletons make love,\nDo they see their jaw-words\nAs the antique discarding\n\nOf the shaved dice of sex?\nNo more walking on top of this world\nWhen skeletons make love.\n\nI think of love as the child\nOf skeletons the way a charnel\nGround must think about\n\nThe mystery of a world\nRe-creating itself again and\nAgain as its offspring.\n\nAnd what of those eagle claw\nFingers- what mesmerizes them\nNow, when skeletons make love\n\nTo a sound like beer bottles\nAcross the river of pleasure's\nSharp and colorless touch?\n\nWhen skeletons make love,\nDo they wish they could take\nBack every minute wasted\n\nUnder the tin-roof of precedent\nRequired to suddenly understand\nExactly how inseparable they'd been?\n\nBecause all things are beautiful\nAnd subject to that which adorns,\nWhen skeletons make love\n\nSometimes it is with coal dust\nAnd ash that the scaffolding\nOf humanity is cloaked,\n\nSometimes with starfish and\nSand dollars or strands of\nSeagrass or halos of kelp,\n\nSometimes it is with crystal-wrapped\nFemurs, sometimes quartz or bullets\nEmbedded in a spine,\n\nSome skeletons come to one\nAnother with feathers or ribbons\nTied to bones, some lashed tight\n\nWith rope or barbed wire\nAround neck vertebrae,\nSome attach silver, rubies,\n\nTurquoise or jade to their bones,\nWeave garlands of fresh flowers\nOr bits of cloth or brass bells,\n\nStamps, coins or fur, perfumed oils,\nArnica or candles that lit them\nUp and attracted moths,\n\nFor there is nothing to resist once\nThe eroded heart is gone- \nHaving peeled through its skins,\n\nLeaving sorrow and doubt like snakes\nIn the costume room of angels,\nThey are free to cross any distance\n\nThat alive, was only a reflection\nOf the closeness surging between them\nWhen skeletons make love.\n\nThis was an intimacy grown from\nDeath- for they had never entirely\nApproved of being human\n\nNor grief's uncontrollably lonesome\nLoss, its heavy and slow moonrises,\nThe coolness of tears.\n\nThey had forgotten to worry about\nFireballs of lightning striking them twice,\nAbout pool table hid guns,\n\nAbout the sadness of old things- \nBeesmoke and all that goes awful\nWrong inside a person's head.\n\nThis one had to be right about\nEverything. That one was a witch.\nMany rolled out the rocks in\n\nTheir head as soon as trouble\nEven suggested itself on the horizon.\nThey could not choose their dreams.\n\nWhen skeletons make love,\nThey find ways without words\nTo describe the acute feeling\n\nOf being chosen by a stranger,\nEven after the funeral. Certain\nKinds of love you can't see,\n\nCertain kinds of love require\nThe knowing strength of bone.\nCertain kinds of love need\n\nExactly what you cannot give,\nCertain kinds of love are nothing\nMore than not overdressed.\n\nWhen skeletons make love, there is\nNo pride, too late for breakfast,\nNo insistent sordid quarrel,\n\nNo rudeness, shock, or blasphemy,\nThe monster they became.\nThe marrow of love is all there is,\n\nNot the sense of one gradually has\nLosing the ability to make out leaves,\nThe different slicknesses of rain,\n\nThe tantra that prepares a body for\nWhat lies ahead, even those who die\nAlone so none may track their spirit.\n\nWhen skeletons make love,\nIt can be a subtle as a breeze,\nAs plain as two geese gently\n\nGliding toward one another\nAt red and purple dusk\nOn a smooth stretch of river,\n\nAs just as the great works of humanitarians\nMingling with the lowly and unsung,\nExploited, wounded and pushed aside.\n\nWhen skeletons make love, it's their way\nOf saying to one another I bow down\nTo you, you made my life a living hell.\n\nWhen skeletons make love, they\nLaugh at us because they know\nEverything'll be alright.\n\nWhen skeletons make love,\nIt's only their bones that are dead\nAnd scattered and behind them.\n\nThey can tell it's death if one of\nThem is too solemn. Insecurity is another\nWay they can tell it's death.\n\nThey cannot know how they will\nWake or if they'll be there\nWhen they wake.\n\nThey cannot help sharing what they\nHad never shared and what\nThey believed could not be shared.\n\nNeither are they diminished\nBy the sharpening of the perceptions\nThey have now, nor have they sadness.\n\nWhen skeletons make love, it's like\nComing around a curve in a mountain\nRoad and the road ahead not there.\n\nWhen skeletons make love, it is\nAs though they were opening a big locked\nSuitcase in which a pile of stories\n\nIn a child's notebook had been written\nAnd find the stories gone and so\nThey lock the suitcase again not believing\n\nIt could be possible for the stories to\nHave vanished. It must be some ghastly\nJoke, but unlocking the big suitcase\n\nOnce again they check it and after\nLocking it they check again, knowing\nThat they were destroyed.\n\nWhen skeletons make love, it's as if\nThey are saying there's nothing to do,\nBut we'll do it, we'll really do it.\n\nThey lay curled up in each other as if\nTwo tusks left during a rebellion on a trek across\nA bitter, dry lake against the rose brown\n\nEarly morning color of the ground, lovely\nFor the unbelievable smoothness of\nTheir bones as the light grows stronger.\n\nWhen skeletons make love, it is as\nIf they were writing in the sand the stories\nThat they'd lost just to write them down\n\nAnd that even though lost they could\nWrite them again and again fully intact.\nNot a sentence was missing.\n\nWhen they made love, they would\nMake love again, and say to one another\nBut not aloud, I'm with you, I'm your\n\nBoy except when I'm your girl,\nChanging from a girl into a boy\nAnd back again, chin up, nothing\n\nCan stop that and all the other\nLoving decisions that are so easy\nTo make when you haven't seen\n\nHow too many of them can turn out.\nI don't know, we'll just be us, they say\nWhen skeletons make love.\n\nI'm going to make love to you forever,\nThey said at the end, both dead\nAnd empty, but it was not over."}
