{"subject": "The Call", "text": "Romira, stay,\nAnd run not thus like a young Roe away,\nNo enemie\nPursues thee (foolish girle) tis onely I,\nI'le keep off harms,\nIf thou'l be pleas'd to garrison mine arms;\nWhat dost thou fear\nI'le turn a Traitour? may these Roses here\nTo palenesse shred,\nAnd Lilies stand disguised in new Red,\nIf that I lay\nA snare, wherein thou wouldst not gladly stay;\nSee fee the Sunne\nDoes slowly to his azure Lodging run,\nCome sit but here\nAnd presently hee'l quit our Hempisphere,\nSo still among\nLovers, time is too short or else too long;\nHere will we spin\nLegends for them that have Love Martyrs been,\nHere on this plain\nWee'l talk Narcissus to a flour again;\nCome here, and chose\nOn which of these proud plats thou would repose,\nHere maist thou shame\nThe rusty Violets, with the Crimson flame\nOf either cheek,\nAnd Primroses white as thy fingers seek,\nNay, thou maist prove\nThat mans most Noble Passion is to Love."}
