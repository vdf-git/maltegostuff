{"subject": "Wild Is She, None Can Make Her His Friend", "text": "When she kills with her glances, \nher speech restores to life, as tho she,\n in giving life thereby, were Jesus.\nThe smooth surface of her legs is (like)  the Tora in brightness,\n and I follow it and tread in its footsteps as tho' I were Moses.\nShe is a bishopess, one of the daughters of Rome,\n unadorned: thou seest in her a radiant Goodness.\nWild is she, none can make her his friend; \n she has gotten in her solitary chamber \na mausoleum for remembrance.\nShe has baffled everyone who is learned in our religion, \nevery student of the Psalms of David,\n every Jewish doctor, and every Christian priest.\nIf with a gesture she demands the Gospel,\n thou wouldst deem us to be priests \nand patriarchs and deacons.\nThe day when they departed on the road,\n I prepared for war the armies of my patience, host after host."}
