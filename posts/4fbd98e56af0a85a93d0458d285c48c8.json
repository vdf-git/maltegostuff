{"subject": "Burning The Book", "text": "The anthology of love poems I bought\nfor a quarter is brittle, anyway, and comes\napart when I read it.\nOne at a time, I throw pages on the fire\nand watch smoke make its way up\nand out.\nI'm almost to the index when I hear\na murmuring in the street. My neighbors\nare watching it snow.\nI put on my blue jacket and join them.\nWe like each other and push each other\naway.\nThe children stand with their mouths\nopen.\nI can see nouns - longing, rapture, bliss -\nland on every tongue, then disappear."}
