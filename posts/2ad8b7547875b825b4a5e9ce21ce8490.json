That two pieces\nOf bread are more than one's about all you'll end up with.\nMy young son asks me: Must I learn French?\nWhat is the use, I feel like saying. This State's collapsing.\nAnd if you just rub your belly with your hand and\nGroan, you'll be understood with little trouble.\nMy young son asks me: Must I learn history?\nWhat is the use, I feel like saying. Learn to stick\nYour head in the earth, and maybe you'll still survive.\n\nYes, learn mathematics, I tell him.\nLearn your French, learn your history!"}
