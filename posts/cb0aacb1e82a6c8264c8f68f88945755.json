{"subject": "A Reveire", "text": "I am sitting by the river,\nAnd I while an hour away,\nWatching circles start and widen\nIn their momentary play.\nHere a stronger whelms a weaker\nAs its ring expanding flies,\nThere one rises to the surface,\nAs another fades and dies.\nAnd I solemn grow with thinking,\nFor just now it would me seem,\nThat each life is like a circle -\nOn time's deep, impellant stream.\nDo we not upon its bosom\nLinger for a little day,\nMaking faint and fleeting impress,\nThen forever fade away.\nWhile the strong unresting river\nToward Eternity doth glide,\nAll regardless of the circles\nThat have pulsed upon its 'ide."}
