{"subject": "Glistening", "text": "Like a fresh dewdrop of morning, \nAnd very similar to the \nRealm of sweet desires, \nToday I am just enjoying \nThe day's inspiring song\nAnd my running train at its own way. \nThose full bloomed mango trees \nAre the lenient and the glint \nOf quiet spring morning is \nIncredible and very rapturous\nFor emboldening \nMy beloved's beautiful face.\nLook at this glorious moment, \nLook beyond the way, \nNothing is broody today, \nGathering of reminiscence allowing \nPut my finger down \nTo write few more words, \nFew more glistening images \nIn my simple free-verse poetic page."}
