{"subject": "Autumn", "text": "Fugitive, wistful, \nPausing at edge of her going, \nAutumn, the maiden, turns, \nLeans to the earth with ineffable \nGesture. Ah, more than \nSpring's skies her skies shine \nTender and frailer \nBloom than plum-bloom or almond \nLies on her hillsides, her fields, \nMisted, faint-flushing. Ah, lovelier \nIs her refusal than \nYielding who pauses with grave \nBackward smiling, with light \nUnforgettable touch of \nFingers withdrawn. . . Pauses, lo \nVanishes. . fugitive, wistful. . . \n\nx\n'Ah me\u2026 Alas' \n\n(He) \n\nAh me, my love's heart, \nLike some frail flower, apart, \nHigh, on the cliff's edge growing, \nTouched by unhindered sun to sweeter showing, \nSwung by each faint wind's faintest blowing, \nBut so, on the cliff's edge growing, \n\nFrom man's reach aloof, apart: \nAh me, my love's heart! \n\n(She) \n\nAlack, alas, my lover, \nAs one who would discover \nAt world's end his path, \nNor knows at all what faery way he hath \nWho turneth dreaming into faith \nAnd followeth that near path \nHis own heart dareth to discover: \nAlack, alas, my lover!"}
