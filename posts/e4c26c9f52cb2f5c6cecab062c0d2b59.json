{"subject": "Bonnie Callander", "text": "Chorus --\n\nBonnie Helen, will you go to Callander with me\nAnd gaze upon its beauties and romantic scenery\nDear Helen, it will help to drive all sorrow away;\nTherefore come, sweet Helen, and let's have a holiday. \nCallander is a pretty little town most lovely to see,\nSituated in the midst of mountains towering frowningly;\nAnd Ben Ledi is the chief amongst them and famous in history,\nLooking stern and rugged in all its majesty. \n\nChorus \n\nAnd as for Bracklinn Falls, they are impressive to sight,\nEspecially the Keltie, which will the visitor's heart delight,\nWith its bonnie banks bordered with beautiful trees,\nAnd the effect would be sure the spectator to please. \n\nChorus \n\nThe hawthorn hedges and the beautiful wild flowers\nWill help to enliven the scene and while away the hours;\nAnd as the spectator gazes upon Keltie waterfall,\nThe rumbling and fumbling of the water does his heart appall. \n\nChorus \n\nAs it makes one fearful plunge into a yawning abyss below,\nFifty or sixty feet beneath, where it splashes to and fro,\nAnd seethes and boils in a great deep pool,\nAnd the sweet, fragrant air around it is very cool. \n\nChorus \n\n'Tis said two lovers met there with a tragic fate.\nAlas! poor souls, and no one near to extricate.\nThe rail of the bridge upon which they were leaning gave way,\nAnd they were drowned in the boiling gulf. Oh, horror and dismay! \n\nChorus \n\nThe Pass of Leny is most wild and amazing to see,\nWith its beetling crags and towering mountains and romantic scenery;\nAnd the brawling Leny, with its little waterfalls,\nWill repay the visitor for the time occupied any time he calls. \n\nChorus \n\nThen lovers of the picturesque make haste and go away\nTo the pretty little village of Callander without delay,\nAnd breathe the fresh air in the harvest time,\nAnd revel amongst romantic scenery in the beautiful sunshine."}
