{"subject": "Clouds", "text": "Clouds take many shapes and sizes  \nTinged with many hues and rays.  \nWhen all is gently subsided  \nSoon, too soon, they fade away.  \nOne day while walking on the green  \nA lovely sight did I behold  \nFor in the sky up so high  \nThere was a cloud outlined in gold.  \nIt looked just like the  \nVirgin Mary with a golden halo there  \nA figment of immortal beauty  \nThat would soon disappear.  \nLife is like the clouds up yonder  \nAlways changing never stopping  \nSoon too soon it fades away."}
