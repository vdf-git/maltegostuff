{"subject": "Freshwater Fish", "text": "Lavarello is the Lombard name for a fish\nthat lives at the lake bottom. It has a tiny head,\nlike one who rarely needs to think. But by its\nshape, it adapts to the depth. Silver white is\nits color. It keeps to the confines of dark waters,\ncold, and one assumes it's lazy and pacific.\nWe see it occasionally on the fishmonger's\ncounter, its body crowned by the redness of the gills.\n\nTranslation: 2009, Ron Banerjee"}
