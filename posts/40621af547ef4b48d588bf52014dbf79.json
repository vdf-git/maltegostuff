{"subject": "Memories", "text": "Remembering is wonderful,  \nWith memories like ours,  \nWe've had so much that's precious,  \nSo many golden hours.  \nWe felt love's first awakening,  \nIn our very first dear dates,  \nIn three short weeks together,  \nWe knew we would be mates.  \nWe had our first dear marriage,  \nIn such a lovely way,  \nWe had our wedding dinner,  \nIn a little town's cafe.  \nWe drove home in the sunshine,  \nTo surroundings we both knew,  \nBut we just did not see them,  \nFor we were lifted to the blue.  \nYes, remembering is so divine,  \nAnd one of life's most precious gifts.  \nFor they are ours and ours alone,  \nTo share and have and ever hold."}
