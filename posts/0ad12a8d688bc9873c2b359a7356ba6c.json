{"subject": "Hallelujah: A Sestina", "text": "A wind's word, the Hebrew Hallelujah.\nI wonder they never gave it to a boy\n(Hal for short) boy with wind-wild hair.\nIt means Praise God, as well it should since praise\nIs what God's for. Why didn't they call my father\nHallelujah instead of Ebenezer? \n\nEben, of course, but christened Ebenezer,\nProduct of Nova Scotia (hallelujah).\nDaniel, a country doctor, was his father\nAnd my father his tenth and final boy.\nA baby and last, he had a baby's praise:\nRed petticoats, red cheeks, and crow-black hair. \n\nA boy has little to say about his hair\nAnd little about a name like Ebenezer\nExcept that you can shorten either. Praise\nGod for that, for that shout Hallelujah.\nShout Hallelujah for everything a boy\nCan be that is not his father or grandfather. \n\nBut then, before you know it, he is a father\nToo and passing on his brand of hair\nTo one more perfectly defenseless boy,\nDubbing him John or James or Ebenezer\nBut never, so far as I know, Hallelujah,\nAs if God didn't need quite that much praise. \n\nBut what I'm coming to - Could I ever praise\nMy father half enough for being a father\nWho let me be myself? Sing Hallelujah.\nPreacher he was with a prophet's head of hair\nAnd what but a prophet's name was Ebenezer,\nHowever little I guessed it as a boy? \n\nOutlandish names of course are never a boy's\nChoice. And it takes some time to learn to praise.\nStone of Help is the meaning of Ebenezer.\nStone of Help - what fitter name for my father?\nAlways the Stone of Help however his hair\nMight graduate from black to Hallelujah. \n\nSuch is the old drama of boy and father.\nPraise from a grayhead now with thinning hair.\nSing Ebenezer, Robert, sing Hallelujah!"}
