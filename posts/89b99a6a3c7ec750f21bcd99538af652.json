{"subject": "Twas Lately Said In Open Court", "text": "'Twas lately said in open court\nBy one, the first of legal lights,\nThat malice with the dead might sport\nAt will, for 'dead men had no rights;'\nThat were it not from wrong to save\nThe quick, the body could affirm\nNo title even to a grave,\nIf left abandoned to the worm.\nThe doubting heart within me died;\nI thought upon a distant spot,\nI thought of two where side by side\nTheir bodies lay, and they were not. \nWhen suddenly there rose before,\nThere flashed upon my inward eye,\nA face that I shall see no more\nIn fainter light beneath the sky;\nAnd flickering over all the face\nThere played a smile, the merry flame\nOf such a joy as left no place\nFor care of earthly name or claim;\nA smile of light and life so full,\nIts mirth o'erflowed me as it spread,\nIn frank surprise that men how dull\nSoever, could account him dead!"}
