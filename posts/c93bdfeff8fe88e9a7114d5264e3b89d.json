{"subject": "Fragmentary Blue", "text": "Why make so much of fragmentary blue\nIn here and there a bird, or butterfly,\nOr flower, or wearing-stone, or open eye,\nWhen heaven presents in sheets the solid hue?\n\nSince earth is earth, perhaps, not heaven (as yet)--\nThough some savants make earth include the sky;\nAnd blue so far above us comes so high,\nIt only gives our wish for blue a whet."}
