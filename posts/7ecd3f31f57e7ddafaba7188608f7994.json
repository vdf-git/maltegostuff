{"subject": "To Mrs. Henry Siddons", "text": "O lady! thou, who in the olden time\nHadst been the star of many a poet's dream!\nThou, who unto a mind of mould sublime,\nWeddest the gentle graces that beseem\nFair woman's best! forgive the daring line\nThat falters forth thy praise! nor let thine eye\nGlance o'er the vain attempt too scornfully;\nBut, as thou read'st, think what a love was mine,\nThat made me venture on a theme, that none\nCan know thee, and not feel a hopeless one.\nThou art most fair, though sorrow's chastening wing\nHath past, and left its shadow on thy brow.\nAnd solemn thoughts are gently mellowing\nThe splendour of thy beauty's summer now.\nThou art most fair! but thine is loveliness\nThat dwells not only on the lip, or eye;\nThy beauty, is thy pure heart's holiness;\nThy grace, thy lofty spirit's majesty.\nWhile thus I gaze on thee, and watch thee glide,\nLike some calm spirit o'er life's troubled stream,\nWith thy twin buds of beauty by thy side\nTogether blossoming; I almost deem\nThat I behold the loveliness and truth,\nThat like fair visions hovered round my youth,\nLong sought\u2014and then forgotten as a dream."}
