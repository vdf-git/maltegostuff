{"subject": "Worldly Things", "text": "Don\u2019t get wrapped up in worldly things  \nSuch things are transitory  \nIn Heaven, where our Father lives  \nAre truly all life\u2019s glories.  Though bodies die, our spirits live.  \nThings of this earth don\u2019t linger.  \nIn Heaven\u2019s world our hearts live on,  \nand all the love within us.  So put away life\u2019s foolish cares  \nand wants, and needs, and worries.  \nFor only in God\u2019s world above,  \nAre things not transitory."}
