{"subject": "Constantinople", "text": "Written January 1718 in the Chiosk at Pera, overlooking Constantinople\nGive me Great God (said I) a Little Farm\nin Summer shady, &amp; in Winter warm\nwhere a cool spring gives birth to a clear brook\nby Nature slideing down a mossy Rock\nNot artfully in Leaden Pipes convey'd\nOr greatly falling in a forc'd Cascade\nPure &amp; unsully'd winding throu' ye Shade.\nAll bounteous Heaven has added to my Praier\na softer Climate and a purer Air.\n\nOur Frozen Isle now chilling Winter binds\nDeform'd by Rains, &amp; rough wth blasting Winds\nye wither'd Woods grown white wth hoary Frost\nby driving storms their scatter'd beautys lost\nThe Trembling birds their leaveless coverts shun\nAnd seek in distant Climes a warmer Sun\nThe Water Nymphs their silenced Urns deplore\nEven Thames benumb'd a River now no more\nThe barren Meadows give no more delight\nby Glist'ning Snows made painfull to ye Sight.\n\nHere Summer reigns wth one Eternal Smile\nAnd double Harvests bless ye happy Soil.\nFair, fertile Fields to warm Indulgent Heaven\nHas every Charm of every Season given!\nNo Killing Cold deforms ye Beauteous Year\nThe springing Flowers no coming Winter Fear\nBut as ye Parent Rose decays &amp; dies\nye Infant Buds wth brighter Colours rise\nAnd with fresh sweets ye Mother-scent supplys\nNear them the Vi'let glows wth odours blest\nAnd blooms in more than Tyrian Purple drest\nThe rich Jonquils their golden gleam display\nAnd shine in glorys emulateing day.\nThese chearfull Groves their living Leaves retain\nThe Streams still murmur undefil'd by Rain\nAnd growing Green adorns ye Fruitfull Plain\nThe warbling Kind uninterrupted Sing,\nWarm'd wth Enjoyment of perpetual Spring.\n\nHere from my Window I at once survey\nThe crouded City, &amp; resounding Sea\nIn distant Views see Assian Mountains rise\nAnd Lose their Snowy Summits in ye Skies.\nAbove those Mountains high Olympus Tow'rs\nThe Parliamental Seat of Heavenly Powers.\nNew to ye Sight my ravish'd Eyes admire\nEach guilded Crescent &amp; each Antique Spire\nThe Fair Serail where sunk in Idle ease\nThe Lazy Monarch melts his thoughtless days\nThe Marble Mosques beneath whose Ample Domes\nFierce Warlike Sultans sleep in peacefull Tombs\nThose lofty Structures once the Christian boast\nTheir Names, their Honnours, &amp; their Beautys lost\nThose Altars bright wth Gold, wth Sculpture grac'd\nBy barbarous Zeal of savage Foes defac'd\nConvents where Emperors profess'd of old\nThe Labour'd Pillars that their Triumphs told.\nVain Monuments of Men that once were great!\nSunk, undistinguish'd, by one Common Fate!\nHow art thou falln Imperial City, Low!\nWhere are thy Hopes of Roman Glory now?\nWhere are thy Palaces by Prelates rais'd\nWhere preistly Pomp in Purple Lustre blaz'd?\nSo vast, that Youthfull Kings might there reside\nSo Splendid; to content a Patriarchs pride\nWhere Grecian Artists all their skill displayd\nBefore ye happy Sciences decay'd;\nSo vast, that Youthfull Kings might there reside\nSo Splendid; to content a Patriarchs Pride;\nConvents where Emperors proffess'd of Old,\nThe Labour'd Pillars that their Triumphs told,\nVain Monuments of Men that once were great!\nSunk, undistinguish'd in one common Fate!\n\nOne Little Spot, the small Fenar contains,\nOf Greek Nobillity, the poor Remains,\nWhere other Helens show like powerfull Charms\nAs once engag'd the Warring World in Arms:\nThose Names that Roial Auncestry can boast\nIn mean Mechanic Arts obscurely lost\nThose Eyes a second Homer might inspire,\nfix'd at the Loom, destroy their useless Fire.\n\nGreiv'd at a view which strikes vpon my Mind\nThe short liv'd Vanity of Human kind\nIn Gaudy Objects I indulge my Sight,\nAnd turn where Eastern Pomp gives gay delight.\n\nSee; the vast Train in various Habits dress'd!\nBy the Bright Seymetar and Sable Vest;\nThe Vizier proud, distinguish'd o're the rest!\nSix slaves in gay Attire his Bridle hold;\nHis Bridle rough with Gems, his Stirups Gold;\nHis Snowy Steed adorn'd with lavish Pride\nWhole Troops of Soldiers mounted by his Side,\nThese toss the Plumy Crest, Arabian Coursers guide.\nWith awfull Duty all decline their Eyes,\nNo bellowing Shouts of noisy Crouds arise;\nSilence in solemn State the march attends\nTill at the dread Divan the slow processions ends.\nYet not these Objects all profusely Gay,\nThe Gilded Navy that adorns the Sea,\nThe riseing City in Confusion fair;\nMagnificently form'd irregular\nWhere Woods and Palaces at once surprise\nGardens, on Gardens, Domes on Domes arise\nAnd endless Beauties tire the wandering Eyes,\nSo sooths my Wishes, or so charms my Mind,\nAs this Retreat, secure from Human kind.\nNo Knaves successfull Craft does Spleen excite\nNo Coxcombs tawdry Splendour shocks my Sight;\nNo Mob Alarm awakes my Female Fears,\nNo unrewarded Merit asks my Tears;\nNor Praise my Mind, nor Envy hurts my Ear,\nEven Fame it selfe can hardly reach me here,\nImpertinence with all her Tattling Train\nFair-sounding Flatterys delicious Bane\nCensorious Folly; Noisy Party Rage;\nThe Thousand with which she must engage\nWho dare have Virtue in a Vicious Age."}
