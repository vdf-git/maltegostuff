{"subject": "CRESCENT MOON OVER THE EIFFEL TOWER", "text": "First I think of Jesus, or not actually Jesus,\nbut the vapour trail from a jet, which makes\na line across the hard sky parallel with the top\nof my window, which makes me think of Apollinaire\nwho said in a poem that Jesus is the holder\nof the world high altitude record, a truly modern\naviator, and that's how I think of Jesus,\nbeing in Paris and all, the thing with Apollinaire.\nBut I'm looking at the line the vapour trail makes,\nwhich way up in the sky would form a perfect T\nwith the tip of the Eiffel Tower (the tip of the\nTour Eiffel sounds better in a poem) if the Tour Eiffel\nwere a fair whack higher. You know what I mean:\nblue symmetries of summer. And then I notice,\nand here's what the poem's about, when my eyes\nare making the imaginary T, just above the point\nwhere my imaginary much higher Tour Eiffel\nwould meet the vapour trail, a crescent moon.\nA crescent moon so thin and faint it's almost not there\nin the hot white Paris sky. But it is there,\nand it's above the Eiffel Tower, pardon,\nla Tour Eiffel, and it's above the vapour trail\nthat Jesus in a jet has made. What do I learn\nfrom this experience? Well, in two weeks' time,\nif the weather holds, and it should, there'll be\na fat full moon over Paris, and I'm up the hill\nin Montmartre, with a view to fucking die for.\nI can see three quarters of the sky, so I'm sure\nthat around two weeks from now, one way\nor another, I'll be seeing that fat full moon.\nAnd this is a thought that is not at all unpleasant."}
