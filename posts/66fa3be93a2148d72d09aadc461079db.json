{"subject": "The Sonnets To Orpheus: Xxv", "text": "But you now, dear girl, whom I loved like a flower whose\n   name\nI didn't know, you who so early were taken away:\nI will once more call up your image and show it to them,\nbeautiful companion of the unsubduable cry.\n\nDancer whose body filled with your hesitant fate,\npausing, as though your young flesh had been cast in bronze;\ngrieving and listening--. Then, from the high dominions,\nunearthly music fell into your altered heart.\n\nAlready possessed by shadows, with illness near,\nyour blood flowed darkly; yet, though for a moment\n   suspicious,\nit burst out into the natural pulses of spring.\n\nAgain and again interrupted by downfall and darkness,\nearthly, it gleamed. Till, after a terrible pounding,\nit entered the inconsolably open door.\nTranslated by Stephen Mitchell"}
