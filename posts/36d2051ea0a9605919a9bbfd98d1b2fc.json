{"subject": "An Epistle From A Gentleman To Madam Deshouliers", "text": "URANIA, whom the Town admires, \n Whose Wit and Beauty share our Praise; \nThis fair URANIA who inspires \n A thousand Joys a thousand ways, \nShe, who cou'd with a Glance convey \n Favours, that had my Hopes outdone, \nHas lent me Money on that Day, \n Which our Acquaintance first begun. \n\nNor with the Happiness I taste, \n Let any jealous Doubts contend: \nHer Friendship is secure to last, \n Beginning where all others end. \n\nAnd thou, known Cheat! upheld by Law, \n Thou Disappointer of the craving Mind, \nBASSETTE, who thy Original dost draw \n From Venice (by uncertain Seas confin'd); \nAuthor of Murmurs, and of Care, \n Of pleasing Hopes, concluding in Despair: \nTo thee my strange Felicity I owe, \n From thy Oppression did this Succour flow. \nLess had I gained, had'st thou propitious been, \n Who better by my Loss hast taught me how to Win. \nYet tell me, my transported Brain! \n (whose Pride this Benefit awakes) \nKnow'st thou, what on this Chance depends? \n And are we not exalted thus in vain, \nWhilst we observe the Money which she lends, \n But not, alas! the Heart she takes, \nThe fond Engagements, and the Ties \n Her fatal Bounty does impose, \nWho makes Reprisals, with her Eyes, \n For what her gen'rous Hand bestows? \n\nAnd tho' I quickly can return \n Those useful Pieces, which she gave; \nCan I again, or wou'd I have \n That which her Charms have from me borne? \n\nYet let us quit th' obliging Score; \nAnd whilst we borrow'd Gold restore, \nWhilst readily we own the Debt, \nAnd Gratitude before her set \n In its approved and fairest Light; \nLet her effectually be taught \n By that instructive, harmless Slight, \nThat also in her turn she ought \n (Repaying ev'ry tender Thought) \nKindness with Kindness to requite."}
