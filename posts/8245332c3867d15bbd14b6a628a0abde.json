{"subject": "The Jungle Husband", "text": "Dearest Evelyn, I often think of you\nOut with the guns in the jungle stew\nYesterday I hittapotamus\nI put the measurements down for you but they got lost in the fuss\nIt's not a good thing to drink out here\nYou know, I've practically given it up dear.\nTomorrow I am going alone a long way\nInto the jungle. It is all grey\nBut green on top\nOnly sometimes when a tree has fallen\nThe sun comes down plop, it is quite appalling.\nYou never want to go in a jungle pool\nIn the hot sun, it would be the act of a fool\nBecause it's always full of anacondas, Evelyn, not looking ill-fed\nI'll say. So no more now, from your loving husband Wilfred."}
