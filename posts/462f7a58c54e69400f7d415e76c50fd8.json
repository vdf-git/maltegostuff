{"subject": "George Meredith", "text": "Forty years back, when much had place \nThat since has perished out of mind, \nI heard that voice and saw that face.\n\nHe spoke as one afoot will wind \nA morning horn ere men awake; \nHis note was trenchant, turning kind.\n\nHe was one of those whose wit can shake \nAnd riddle to the very core \nThe counterfiets that Time will break....\n\nOf late, when we two met once more, \nThe luminous countenance and rare \nShone just as forty years before.\n\nSo that, when now all tongues declare \nHis shape unseen by his green hill, \nI scarce believe he sits not there.\n\nNo matter. Further and further still \nThrough the world's vaprous vitiate air \nHis words wing on--as live words will."}
