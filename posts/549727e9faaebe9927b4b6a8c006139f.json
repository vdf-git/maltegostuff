{"subject": "Running Brush", "text": "Basho said to refuse a prayer until its warmth hunches inside like \na bird in its hutch. First the fledgling is born, then the worm, then they \nmeet somewhere in the grass. I choose my paper for its cereal color, fuss \nover shaving a pencil. The prayer means to cleanse both triumph and lust. \nO derivative, sunlight reaping the trees, this whole morning cries through a \nsingle reed. Pencil, razor blade, spit\u2014I'll try not to hurry."}
