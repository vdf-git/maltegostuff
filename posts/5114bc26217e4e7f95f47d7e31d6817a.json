{"subject": "Heam, Sweet Heam", "text": "When oft at neet I wanders heame \nTo cosy cot an' busy deame, \nMy hardest day's wark seems but leet, \nWhen I can get back heame at neet, \nMy wife an' bairns to sit besaade, \nAroond my awn bit firesaade. \nWhat comfort there's i' steep for me, \nA laatle prattler on my knee! \nWhat tales I have to listen tea! \nBut just at fost there's sike to-dea \nAs niver was. Each laatle dot \nCan fain agree for t' fav'rite spot. \nSike problems they can set for me \n'T wad puzzle waaser heeads mebbe. \nAn' questions hawf a scoor they ask, \nTo answer' em wad prove a task; \nFor laatle thowts stray far away \nTo things mysterious, oot o' t' way. \nAn' then sike toffer they torn oot, \nAn' pratty lips begin to poot, \nIf iverything's nut stowed away \nTo cumulate frae day to day. \nSike treasures they could niver spare, \nBut gether mair an' mair an' mair \nIn ivery pocket. I've nea doot \nThey've things they think the wo'ld aboot. \nAn' when their bed-taame's drawin' nigh, \nWi' heavy heead an' sleepy eye, \nIt's vary laatle din they mak, \nBut slyly try a nap to tak. \nAn' when on t' lats they've gone aboon, \nI fills my pipe an' sattles do on \nTo have a comfortable smewk. \nAn' then at t' news I has a lewk; \nOr hods a bit o' talk wi' t' wife, \nThe praade an' comfort o' my life. \nCawd winds may blaw, an' snaw-flakes flee, \nAn' neets may be beath lang an' dree, \nOr it may rain an' rain agean, \nSea lang as I've my day's wark dean, \nI wadn't swap my humble heame \nFor bigger hoose or finer neame. \nIf all could as contented be, \nThere'd be mair joy an' less mis'ry."}
