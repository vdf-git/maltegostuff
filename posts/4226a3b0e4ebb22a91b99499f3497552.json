{"subject": "The Visit", "text": "My only mother, who lost sixty pounds, tried to stand up in the bathroom \nand fell backwards on the white linoleum floor in the first hour of the morning \nand was carried to the bed in the nurse's arms and then abruptly \nopened her eyes, later, the room dark, and twisted the needles in her arms \nand talked to her dead friend, Rosie, and heard the doorbell ring \nas though in the kitchen in the old place deciding if she should answer, \nrubbing the circle on her finger where the wedding ring once was \nwhile slipping downward on the sheets like a body without limbs and I slid \nmy good arms beneath her arm-pits and pulled her bony body up \nagainst the two thin pillows. And then, when she was asleep again, \nI walked down the hallway's arc of yellow light, ghosts hovering \non either side of the doors of rooms where the strange sickness \nof being alive was the last thing between dreaming and eternity \nwhich closes like the ocean closes over the blue-starry body \nand does not stop, and I understood again that we never come back, \nand upright, with everything that takes its life seriously, I returned to my mother."}
