{"subject": "Ye Flags Of Picadilly", "text": "Ye flags of Piccadilly, \nWhere I posted up and down, \nAnd wished myself so often \nWell away from you and town--\n\nAre the people walking quietly \nAnd steady on their feet, \nCabs and omnibuses plying \nJust as usual in the street?\n\nDo the houses look as upright \nAs of old they used to be, \nAnd does nothing seem affected \nBy the pitching of the sea?\n\nThrough the Green Park iron railings \nDo the quick pedestrians pass? \nAre the little children playing \nRound the plane-tree in the grass?\n\nThis squally wild northwester \nWith which our vessel fights, \nDoes it merely serve with you to \nCarry up some paper kites?\n\nYe flags of Piccadilly, \nWhich I hated so, I vow \nI could wish with all my heart \nYou were underneath me now!"}
