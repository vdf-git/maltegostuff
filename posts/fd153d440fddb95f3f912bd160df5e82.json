{"subject": "I Weep, But Not Rebellious Tears", "text": "I weep, but not rebellious tears;\nI mourn, but not in hopeless woe;\nI droop, but not with doubtful fears;\nFor whom I've trusted Him I know.\n'Lord, I believe, assuage my grief,\nAnd help - oh, help mine unbelief!'\n\nMy days of youth and health are o'er,\nMy early friends are dead and gone, \nAnd there are times it tries me sore\nTo think I'm left on earth alone.\nBut then faith whispers-''Tis not so; \nHe will not leave, nor let thee go.'\n\nBlind eyes-fond heart-poor soul that sought\nEnduring bliss in things of earth!\nRemembering but with transient thought,\nThy heavenly home, thy second birth;\nTill God in mercy broke at last\nThe bonds that held thee down so fast.\n\nAs link by link was rent away,\nMy heart wept blood, so sharp the pain,\nThat temp'ral loss eternal gain; \nBut I have lived to count this day\nFor all that once detain'd me here\nNow draws me to a holier sphere.\n\nA holier sphere, a happier place,\nWhere I shall know as I am known,\nAnd see my Saviour face to face,\nAnd meet, rejoicing round His throne,\nThe faithful few, made perfect there\nFrom earthly stain and mortal care."}
