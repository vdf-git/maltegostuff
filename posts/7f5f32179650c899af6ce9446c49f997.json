{"subject": "To Perllla", "text": "Ah, my Perilla!  dost thou grieve to see\nMe, day by day, to steal away from thee?\nAge calls me hence, and my gray hairs bid come,\nAnd haste away to mine eternal home;\n'Twill not be long, Perilla, after this,\nThat I must give thee the supremest kiss:--\nDead when I am, first cast in salt, and bring\nPart of the cream from that religious spring,\nWith which, Perilla, wash my hands and feet;\nThat done, then wind me in that very sheet\nWhich wrapt thy smooth limbs, when thou didst implore\nThe Gods' protection, but the night before;\nFollow me weeping to my turf, and there\nLet fall a primrose, and with it a tear:\nThen lastly, let some weekly strewings be\nDevoted to the memory of me;\nThen shall my ghost not walk about, but keep\nStill in the cool and silent shades of sleep."}
