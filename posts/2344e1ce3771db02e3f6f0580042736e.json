{"subject": "Hymn To Lauds Sunday", "text": "FRAMER of the earth and sky, \n   Ruler of the day and night, \nWith a glad variety, \n   Tempering all, and making light; \n\nGleams upon our dark path flinging, \n   Cutting short each night begun, \nHark! for chanticleer is singing, \n   Hark! he chides the lingering sun. \n\nAnd the morning star replies, \n   And lets loose the imprison'd day; \nAnd the godless bandit flies \n   From his haunt and from his prey. \n\nShrill it sounds, the storm relenting \n   Soothes the weary seaman's ears; \nOnce it wrought a great repenting, \n   In that flood of Peter's tears. \n\nRouse we; let the blithesome cry \n   Of that bird our hearts awaken; \nChide the slumberers as they lie, \n   And arrest the sin-o'ertaken. \n\nHope and health are in his strain, \n   To the fearful and the ailing; \nMurder sheathes his blade profane, \n   Faith revives when faith was failing. \n\nJesu, Master! when we sin, \n   Turn on us Thy healing face; \nIt will melt the offence within \n   Into penitential grace: \n\nBeam on our bewilder'd mind, \n   Till its dreamy shadows flee; \nStones cry out where Thou hast shined, \n   Jesu! musical with Thee.  \n\nTo the Father and the Son, \n   And the Spirit, who in Heaven \nEver witness, Three and One, \n   Praise on Earth be ever given."}
