{"subject": "Lines On Tilsonburg", "text": "After him who did mills own\nThis place was called in honor Tilson. \nBright gleaming like a morning star\nIs clear waters of the Otter,\n\nAnd it doth form here a vast pond\nWhich extends for miles beyond ;\nA fortune on town it will shower, \nThis prodigious water-power.\n\nNo other spots to youth appear \nLike lovely little lake Lisgear, \nAnd few small towns have fine roadway ,\nLined with brick blocks, like your Broadway.\n\nElsewhere, the firemen slave like Turks,\nBut you have got good water works ;\nAnd some do many a mile go\nFor to see your famous silo."}
