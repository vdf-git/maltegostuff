{"subject": "I Gave You A Twenty", "text": "(This is a fictional poem) \n\nI gave you a twenty and you only gave me change for a ten.\nIf you don't give me the correct change, you don't want to know the trouble you'll be in.\nYou're not going to rip me off, I will not take a loss.\nGive me the correct change now or I'll tell my boss.\nI just told your supervisor and the SOB is giving me the finger.\nI'm going to unload some hurt on him like a wasp using its stinger.\nHe just picked me up and threw me through a pane of glass.\nI didn't think that this guy would be able to kick my ass.\nI've been a customer here for many years, this shouldn't be happening to me.\nIt's embarrassing because the guy who just kicked my ass stands only four feet three.\nI've got cuts and I'm pretty sore.\nI won't ever come back to this store."}
