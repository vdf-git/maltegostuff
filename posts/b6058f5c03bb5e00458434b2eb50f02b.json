{"subject": "Lines Written At Norwich On The First News Of Peace", "text": "What means that wild and joyful cry? \nWhy do yon crowds in mean attire \nThrow thus their ragged arms on high? \nIn want what can such joy inspire?\n\nAnd why on every face I meet \nNow beams a smile, now drops a tear? \nLike longloved friends, lo! strangers greet, . . . .\nEach to his fellow man seems dear.\n\nIn one warm glow of christian love\nForgot all proud distinctions seem;\nThe rich, the poor, together rove;\nTheir eyes with answering kindness beam . . . .\n\nBlest sound! blest sight! . . . . But pray ye pause \nAnd bid my eager wonder cease; \nOf joy like this, say, what's the cause?. . . .\nA thousand voices answer . . . . 'PEACE!'\n\nO sound most welcome to my heart! \nTidings for which I've sighed for years! \nBut ill would words my joy impart; \nLet me my rapture speak in tears.\n\nYe patient poor, from wonder free \nYour signs of joy I now survey, \nAnd hope your sallow cheeks to see \nOnce more the bloom of health display.\n\nOf those poor babes that on your knees \nImploring food have vainly hung, \nYou'll soon each craving want appease, . . . .\nFor Plenty comes with Peace along.\n\nAnd you, fond parents, faithful wives, \nWho've long for sons and husbands feared, \nPeace now shall save their precious lives; \nThey come by danger more endeared.\n\nBut why, to all these transports dead,\nSteals yon shrunk form from forth the throng?\nHas she not heard the tidings spread?\nTell her these shouts to Peace belong . . . .\n\n'Talk not of Peace, . . . . the sound I hate,'\nThe mourner with a sigh replied;\n'Alas! Peace comes for me too late, . . . .\nFor my brave boy in Egypt died!' \n\nPoor mourner! at thy tale of grief\nThe crowd was mute and sad awhile;\nBut e'en compassion's tears are brief\nWhen general transport claims a smile.\n\nFull soon they checked the tender sigh\nTheir glowing hearts to pity gave;\nBut, while the mourner yet was nigh,\nThey warmly blessed the slaughtered brave: . . . .\n\nAnd from all hearts, as sad she passed,\nThis virtuous prayer her sorrow draws: . . . .\n'Grant, Heaven, those tears may be the last\nThat war, detested war, shall cause! . . . .\n\nOh! if with pure ambition fraught\nAll nations join this virtuous prayer,\nIf they, by late experience taught,\nNo longer wish to slay, but spare, . . . .\n\nThen hostile bands on War's red plain \nFor conquest have not vainly burned, \nNor then through long long years in vain \nHave thousands died and millions mourned."}
