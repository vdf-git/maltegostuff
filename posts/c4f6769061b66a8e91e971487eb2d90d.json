{"subject": "A Poem for the Cruel Majority", "text": "The cruel majority emerges! \n\nHail to the cruel majority! \n\nThey will punish the poor for being poor. \nThey will punish the dead for having died. \n\nNothing can make the dark turn into light \nfor the cruel majority. \nNothing can make them feel hunger or terror. \n\nIf the cruel majority would only cup their ears \nthe sea would wash over them. \nThe sea would help them forget their wayward children. \nIt would weave a lullaby for young &amp; old. \n\n(See the cruel majority with hands cupped to their ears, \none foot is in the water, one foot is on the clouds.) \n\nOne man of them is large enough to hold a cloud \nbetween his thumb &amp; middle finger, \nto squeeze a drop of sweat from it before he sleeps. \n\nHe is a little god but not a poet. \n(See how his body heaves.) \n\nThe cruel majority love crowds &amp; picnics. \nThe cruel majority fill up their parks with little flags. \nThe cruel majority celebrate their birthday. \n\nHail to the cruel majority again! \n\nThe cruel majority weep for their unborn children, \nthey weep for the children that they will never bear. \nThe cruel majority are overwhelmed by sorrow. \n\n(Then why are the cruel majority always laughing? \nIs it because night has covered up the city's walls? \nBecause the poor lie hidden in the darkness? \nThe maimed no longer come to show their wounds?) \n\nToday the cruel majority vote to enlarge the darkness. \n\nThey vote for shadows to take the place of ponds \nWhatever they vote for they can bring to pass. \nThe mountains skip like lambs for the cruel majority. \n\nHail to the cruel majority! \nHail! hail! to the cruel majority! \n\nThe mountains skip like lambs, the hills like rams. \nThe cruel majority tear up the earth for the cruel majority. \nThen the cruel majority line up to be buried. \n\nThose who love death will love the cruel majority. \n\nThose who know themselves will know the fear \nthe cruel majority feel when they look in the mirror. \n\nThe cruel majority order the poor to stay poor. \nThey order the sun to shine only on weekdays. \n\nThe god of the cruel majority is hanging from a tree. \nTheir god's voice is the tree screaming as it bends. \nThe tree's voice is as quick as lightning as it streaks across the sky. \n\n(If the cruel majority go to sleep inside their shadows, \nthey will wake to find their beds filled up with glass.) \n\nHail to the god of the cruel majority! \nHail to the eyes in the head of their screaming god! \n\nHail to his face in the mirror! \n\nHail to their faces as they float around him! \n\nHail to their blood &amp; to his! \n\nHail to the blood of the poor they need to feed them! \nHail to their world &amp; their god! \n\nHail &amp; farewell! \nHail &amp; farewell! \nHail &amp; farewell!"}
