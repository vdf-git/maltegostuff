{"subject": "Lost Leader, The", "text": "I.\n\nJust for a handful of silver he left us,\n  Just for a riband to stick in his coat---\nFound the one gift of which fortune bereft us,\n  Lost all the others she lets us devote;\nThey, with the gold to give, doled him out silver,\n  So much was theirs who so little allowed:\nHow all our copper had gone for his service!\n  Rags---were they purple, his heart had been proud!\nWe that had loved him so, followed him, honoured him,\n  Lived in his mild and magnificent eye,\nLearned his great language, caught his clear accents,\n  Made him our pattern to live and to die!\nShakespeare was of us, Milton was for us,\n  Burns, Shelley, were with us,---they watch from their graves!\nHe alone breaks from the van and the free-men,\n  ---He alone sinks to the rear and the slaves!\n\n\tII.\n\nWe shall march prospering,---not thro' his presence;\n  Songs may inspirit us,---not from his lyre;\nDeeds will be done,---while he boasts his quiescence,\n  Still bidding crouch whom the rest bade aspire:\nBlot out his name, then, record one lost soul more,\n  One task more declined, one more foot-path untrod,\nOne more devils'-triumph and sorrow for angels,\n  One wrong more to man, one more insult to God!\nLife's night begins: let him never come back to us!\n  There would be doubt, hesitation and pain,\nForced praise on our part---the glimmer of twilight,\n  Never glad confident morning again!\nBest fight on well, for we taught him---strike gallantly,\n  Menace our heart ere we master his own;\nThen let him receive the new knowledge and wait us,\n  Pardoned in heaven, the first by the throne!"}
