{"subject": "Moral Song", "text": "Would we attain the happiest State, \n   That is design'd us here; \nNo Joy a Rapture must create, \n   No Grief beget Despair. \nNo Injury fierce Anger raise, \n   No Honour tempt to Pride; \nNo vain Desires of empty Praise \n   Must in the Soul abide. \nNo Charms of Youth, or Beauty move \n   The constant, settl'd Breast: \nWho leaves a Passage free to Love, \n   Shall let in, all the rest. \nIn such a Heart soft Peace will live, \n   Where none of these abound; \nThe greatest Blessing, Heav'n do's give, \n   Or can on Earth be found."}
