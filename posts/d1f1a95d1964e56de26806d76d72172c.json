{"subject": "The Panic Bird", "text": "just flew inside my chest. Some\ndays it lights inside my brain,\nbut today it's in my bonehouse,\nrattling ribs like a birdcage.\n\nIf I saw it coming, I'd fend it\noff with machete or baseball bat.\nOr grab its scrawny hackled neck,\nwring it like a wet dishrag.\n\nBut it approaches from behind.\nToo late I sense it at my back --\ncarrion, garbage, excrement.\nOnce inside me it preens, roosts,\n\nvulture on a public utility pole.\nNext it flaps, it cries, it glares,\nit rages, it struts, it thrusts\nits clacking beak into my liver,\n\nmy guts, my heart, rips off strips.\nI fill with black blood, black bile.\nThis may last minutes or days.\nThen it lifts sickle-shaped wings,\n\nrises, is gone, leaving a residue --\nfoul breath, droppings, molted midnight\nfeathers. And life continues.\nAnd then I'm prey to panic again."}
