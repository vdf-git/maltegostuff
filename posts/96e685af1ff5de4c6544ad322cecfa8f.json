{"subject": "Making Tracks", "text": "High on a little hill,\n We found tracks with a will.\n Right there in the dust,\n In a hurry or bust.\n Tiny insect feet in a pair,\n A railroad track to no where,\n The tracks did crisscross,\n But, where was the boss?\n There were crazy eight's \n Without any debates,\n And a few curlicues,\n Without any clues.\n And some great loop-do-loops,\n No one was using hoops.\n Is this the human race,\n As seen from outer space?\n In our whole universe,\n Are we without a verse?"}
