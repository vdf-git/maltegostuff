{"subject": "When Bryan Speaks", "text": "When Bryan speaks, the town's a hive.\nFrom miles around, the autos drive.\nThe sparrow chirps. The rooster crows.\nThe place is kicking and alive.\n\nWhen Bryan speaks, the bunting glows.\nThe raw procession onward flows.\nThe small dogs bark. The children laugh\nA wind of springtime fancy blows.\n\nWhen Bryan speaks, the wigwam shakes.\nThe corporation magnate quakes.\nThe pre-convention plot is smashed.\nThe valiant pleb full-armed awakes.\n\nWhen Bryan speaks, the sky is ours,\nThe wheat, the forests, and the flowers.\nAnd who is here to say us nay?\nFled are the ancient tyrant powers.\n\nWhen Bryan speaks, then I rejoice.\nHis is the strange composite voice\nOf many million singing souls\nWho make world-brotherhood their choice."}
