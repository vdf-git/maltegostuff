{"subject": "The Enemy", "text": "Like everyone I demand to be\nDefended unto the death of \nAll who defend me, all the \nWorld's people I command to \nRoundabout me shield me, to \nFight off the enemy. The \nTheory is if they all stand \nBanded together and wall me \nSafe, there's no one left to \nBe the enemy. Unless I of \nCourse start attack, snap-\nPing and shattering my hands \nOn your invincible backs."}
