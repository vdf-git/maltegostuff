{"subject": "To Immortal Music", "text": "NAY, Music, thou art young! Not long ago\nThou hadst but rounded to thy perfect form,\nThy virginal, sweet heart was hardly warm,\nAnd little knew of passion or of woe.\nNow, prescient darling of the world's old age\u2014\nBorn to its gathered wealth, its subtlety,\nAnd sadness\u2014thou canst sound the soundless sea,\nDeeper than line of deepest thought can gauge.\n\nThy voice, veiled Seraph serving among men,\nWakes strains in us immortal as thine own;\nO say thou wilt not vanish from our ken,\nFly our dim earth as elder lights have flown,\nAnd leave us dumb amid the tuneful spheres,\nWith nothing lasting to the end but tears!"}
