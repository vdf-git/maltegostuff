{"subject": "By The Seaside", "text": "The sun is couched, the sea-fowl gone to rest, \nAnd the wild storm hath somewhere found a nest; \nAir slumbers--wave with wave no longer strives, \nOnly a heaving of the deep survives, \nA tell-tale motion! soon will it be laid, \nAnd by the tide alone the water swayed. \nStealthy withdrawings, interminglings mild \nOf light with shade in beauty reconciled-- \nSuch is the prospect far as sight can range, \nThe soothing recompence, the welcome change. \nWhere, now, the ships that drove before the blast, \nThreatened by angry breakers as they passed; \nAnd by a train of flying clouds bemocked; \nOr, in the hollow surge, at anchor rocked \nAs on a bed of death? Some lodge in peace, \nSaved by His care who bade the tempest cease; \nAnd some, too heedless of past danger, court \nFresh gales to waft them to the far-off port \nBut near, or hanging sea and sky between, \nNot one of all those winged powers is seen, \nSeen in her course, nor 'mid this quiet heard; \nYet oh! how gladly would the air be stirred \nBy some acknowledgment of thanks and praise, \nSoft in its temper as those vesper lays \nSung to the Virgin while accordant oars \nUrge the slow bark along Calabrian shores; \nA sea-born service through the mountains felt \nTill into one loved vision all things melt: \nOr like those hymns that soothe with graver sound \nThe gulfy coast of Norway iron-bound; \nAnd, from the wide and open Baltic, rise \nWith punctual care, Lutherian harmonies. \nHush, not a voice is here! but why repine, \nNow when the star of eve comes forth to shine \nOn British waters with that look benign? \nYe mariners, that plough your onward way, \nOr in the haven rest, or sheltering bay, \nMay silent thanks at least to God be given \nWith a full heart; \"our thoughts are 'heard' in heaven.\""}
