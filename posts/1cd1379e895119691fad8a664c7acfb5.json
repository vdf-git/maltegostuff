{"subject": "Rocket Results", "text": "So here's another of your wicked wiles\u2014\nA rocket which can whizz four hundred miles?\nDo not suppose, if it could travel ten,\nThat it would save your bacon, silly men.\nBut if the ancient ways of war must cease,\nWe'll have to take new thought about the peace.\nThe Atlantic Charter did not, I believe,\nProvide for folk with rockets up their sleeve.\nBe careful, Fritz. The farther you can throw\nThe farther into Europe we must go;\nAnd then, that it may not occur again,\nThe farther\u2014and the fiercer\u2014we'll remain.\nMaybe, to pen the Prussian fireworks in,\nWe now shall need a bridgehead in Berlin.\nAugust 6, 1944"}
