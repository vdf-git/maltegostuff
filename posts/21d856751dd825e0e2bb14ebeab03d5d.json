{"subject": "Untitled", "text": "On a cold winter's night \nthe sky so crisp and clear, \ndarkness seeming so gentle. \nBring comfort to the lonely hearts. \nWith the stars surrounding \nthe wondrous moon, \nwhispering only the promise of a dream. \nOne star seeming to shine \nbrighter than all the rest, \nas it catches your eye. \nBecoming almost mesmerized \nyou make your wish. \nIf you believe with all your heart \nthan anything is possible, \nfor dreams do come true. \nYour heart will rejoice in song, \nyour soul will begin to dance. \nThe moon and stars \nare listening always, because \nwithout hope there are no dreams \nand without dreams are only cold \nand lonely nights without you."}
