{"subject": "Plenty In A Time Of Dearth", "text": "My soul once had its plenteous years,\nAnd throve, with peace and comfort filled,\nLike the fat kine and ripened ears,\nWhich Pharaoh in his dream beheld. \n\nWith pleasing frames and grace received,\nWith means and ordinances fed;\nHow happy for a while I lived,\nAnd little feared the want of bread. \n\nBut famine came and left no sign,\nOf all the plenty I had seen;\nLike the dry ears and half-starved kine,\nI then looked withered, faint and lean. \n\nTo Joseph the Egyptians went,\nTo Jesus I made known my case;\nHe, when my little stock was spent,\nOpened his magazine of grace. \n\nFor he the time of dearth foresaw,\nAnd made provision long before;\nThat famished souls, like me, might draw\nSupplies from his unbounded store. \n\nNow on his bounty I depend,\nAnd live from fear of dearth secure,\nMaintained by such a mighty friend,\nI cannot want till he is poor. \n\nO sinners hear his gracious call!\nHis mercy's door stands open wide,\nHe has enough to feed you all,\nAnd none who come shall be denied."}
