{"subject": "Lonesome Whistle", "text": "Some of us have a bit of a gypsy wander lust deep down in our soul, everytime we hear a whistle off in the distance we attempt to identify a freight from a passenger train. \nThen we can't help wonder if there might be room for one more, then for one brief moment we flirt with the temptation to drop everything and just go for it. \nEven now every once in a while I will hear a whistle off in the distance and once again have to wrestle with the gypsey deep down in my soul, the one that still has the lust to go hop a freight."}
