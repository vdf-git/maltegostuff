{"subject": "Montague Leverson", "text": "As some enormous violet that towers\nColossal o'er the heads of lowlier flowers\nIts giant petals royally displayed,\nAnd casting half the landscape into shade;\nDelivering its odors, like the blows\nOf some strong slugger, at the public nose;\nPride of two Nations-for a single State\nWould scarce suffice to sprout a plant so great;\nSo Leverson's humility, outgrown\nThe meaner virtues that he deigns to own,\nTo the high skies its great corolla rears,\nO'ertopping all he has except his ears."}
