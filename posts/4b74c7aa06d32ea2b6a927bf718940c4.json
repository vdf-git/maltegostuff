{"subject": "The River Of Life", "text": "Winding\u2014winding to the sea,\nEver on, goeth the river free.\nHere he bends, and there he goes,\nHere he stops, and there he flows.\nOnward\u2014to the sea\nGoeth the stream so blithe and free.\n\nAnd so floweth the River of life,\nOnward thru peace and strife,\nHere it turns and there it goes,\nHere it stops, and there it flows.\nOnward\u2014to the ocean of eternity,\nGoeth the river of life so blithe and free."}
