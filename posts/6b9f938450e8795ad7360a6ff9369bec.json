{"subject": "Madhouse", "text": "Family\u2014a mess of acquaintances\u2014whiners,\nAn insufferable carnival of fools.\nFrom work, from friends, from rotten politics\nThe brain is endlessly assailed.\nTake books\u2014garbage and filth:\nOne cat scratches,\nAnother licks, breeds filth\nAnd mews sensually. . .\n\nPeter the Great, Peter the Great!\nYou are the guiltiest of all.\nWhat drove you to the wild north\nTo commit such a sin?\nEight months of winter\u2014instead of dates, cloudberries.\nCold, snot, rain, darkness\u2014Your mad head pulls you from the window\nTo fall down upon the bridge. . .\nI am indignant, indignant! My God, what\u2019s next?!\n\nEach day, from a spoonful of kerosene,\nWe drink the poison of dim trifles. . .\nUnder the lewdness of senseless speeches\nMan grows dull as cattle. . .\n\nThere is a parliament, no? God knows,\nI don\u2019t know. The devil knows.\nHere\u2014I do know\u2014there is sadness,\nAnd the impotence of anger exists...\nPeople moan, are deranged, run wild,\nBut don\u2019t consider hateful days.\n\nWhere are we\u2014dear one, dear blood?\nWhere are we\u2014undying love?\nGuchkovy, the Duma, slush, darkness, cloudberries. . .\nMy dear one! Doesn\u2019t your mad head pull you \nFrom the window to fall on the bridge?\nIndeed, it does pull you, right?"}
