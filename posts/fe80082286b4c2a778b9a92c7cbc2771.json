{"subject": "The Blue Ribbon Did It", "text": "She loved him ; but she saw him drunk ! \n\nAh ! fearful sight for her to see ; \nAnd though it broke her heart, she said \n\nThat they could never married be ; \nAnd other lovers crowded near \nTo breathe their fond hopes in her ear. \nIt puzzled me to see her smile \n\nOn others while she loved him so ; \nFor none of them were half so brave, \n\nOr handsome, straight and tall as Joe. \n\nI think that that was strange \n\nDo n't you ? \nBut then they all wore badges blue. \n\nJoe went and took the pledge, and said \nHe 'd stain his honor never more ; \n\nAnd soon he on his manly breast \nThe badge of his redemption wore ; \n\nAnd when his darling heard of that \n\nHer faithful heart went pit-a-pat \n\nShe sacked her lovers all, and flew \nTo lay her head against the breast \n\nThat wore the blessed badge of blue. \n\nI think that that was sweet \nDo n't you ? \n\nOh, bonny, bonny badge of blue ! \n\nWere I a girl I would n't wed \n\nA man that guzzled rum would you? \n\nI 'd give the chances all to him \n\nWho wore the little badge of blue ; \n\nAnd if he would n't wear it, I \n\nWould pin it on and tell him why. \n\n'T would save us both from grief and woe, \nAnd every mis'ry cold and black ; \n\nIt made another man of Joe, \n\nAnd now he 's got the inside track. \n\nI think I 'm talking sense \nDo n't you ? \n\nThen wear the bonny badge of blue."}
