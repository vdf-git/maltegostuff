{"subject": "Bki:Xi Carpe Diem", "text": "Leucono\u00eb, don\u2019t ask, we never know, what fate the gods grant us,\nwhether your fate or mine, don\u2019t waste your time on Babylonian,\nfutile, calculations. How much better to suffer what happens,\nwhether Jupiter gives us more winters or this is the last one,\none debilitating the Tyrrhenian Sea on opposing cliffs.\nBe wise, and mix the wine, since time is short: limit that far-reaching hope.\nThe envious moment is flying now, now, while we\u2019re speaking:\nSeize the day, place in the hours that come as little faith as you can."}
