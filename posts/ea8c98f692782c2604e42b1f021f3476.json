{"subject": "A Rainbow In Nature", "text": "All the colours of the spectrum in nature can be seen \nRed, orange, yellow, purple, right through to deepest green. \nThe pink and orange of a sunrise just as day is dawning \nIs enough to excite the imagination first thing in the morning. \nThe softest whites and pinks of blossoms in the spring, \nThe many shades of green which leaves and grasses bring. \nA field of golden corn full of poppies red, \nA lush green lawn, where white daisies show their heads. \nA silver stream, a bright blue sky, \nDark grey clouds when a storm is nigh. \nDeep blue sea and soft golden sand \nA bluebell wood that no human planned. \nThe powdery white of freshly fallen snow \nThe shades of gold in a sunset's glow \nThe shimmering feathers on a peacock so blue, \nA hovering kingfisher, a green mallard, too. \nAutumn leaves of gold and reds \nGarden flowers planted out in beds \nEarly morning dew on roses \nWhite billowing mist as a warm day closes: \nI could go on we've so much to see \nA feast for the eyes - and it's all for free. \nGod made all of these with tender loving care \nAnd He's given them to us for you and me to share."}
