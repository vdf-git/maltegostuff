{"subject": "The Flash Point", "text": "The double-edged truth \nhad the exoticism. The blood was\nin air. A blue bird draws\na red line, indulging in spiritualization\nof a gray design. The testosterones\nchart the trajectory in the flame\nof the forest.\n\nYou deploy your army in zero \nhour. Colored leaves start casting\nthe spell. You listen to the rustling\nof skirt. Moon was walking in.\n\nA pink sword and sharpened \nclaws. After the vulture hit, \nthe death wil swoop down on you suddenly."}
