{"subject": "Who Is That Syama Woman", "text": "Who is that Syama woman\nstanding on Bhava?\nAll Her modesty gone,\nShe plays with Him\noverturning sexual custom\nby being on top.\nChoked up,\nwaves of bliss sweeping over Her,\nShe hangs Her head and smiles --\nLove incarnate!\nThe Yamuna, the heavenly Ganges, and between them\nthe honorable Sarasvati --\nbathing at their confluence\nconfers great merit.\nHere the new moon devours the blue moon,\nlike wind extinguishing fire.\n\nPoet Ramprasad says,\nBrahman is merely the radiance of Brahmamayi.\nStare at Her\nand all your sins and pains\nwill vanish."}
