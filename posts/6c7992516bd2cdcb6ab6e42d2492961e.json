{"subject": "Migration", "text": "for Cathy\n\nSnow is falling, snagging its points \non the frayed surfaces. There is lightning \nover Lake Ontario, Erie. In the great \ncentral cities, debt accumulates along the baseboards \nlike hair. Many things were good \nwhile they lasted. The long dance halls \nof neighbourhoods under the trees, \nthe qualified fellow-feeling no less genuine \nfor it. West are silent frozen fields and wheels\nof wind. In the north frost is measured \nin vertical feet, and you sleep sitting because it hurts \nless. It is not winter for long. In April\nshall the tax collector flower forth and language \nupend its papers looking for an entry adequate \nto the sliced smell of budding \npoplars. The sausage man will contrive \nonce more to block the sidewalk with his truck, \nand though it's illegal to idle one's engine \nfor more than three minutes, every one of us will idle \nlike hell. After all that's happened. We're all\nthat's left. In fall, the Arctic tern will fly \n12,500 miles to Antarctica as it did every year \nyou were alive. It navigates by the sun and stars. \nIt tracks the earth's magnetic fields\nsensitively as a compass needle and lives\non what it finds. I don't understand it either."}
