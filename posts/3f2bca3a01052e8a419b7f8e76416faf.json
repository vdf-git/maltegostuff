{"subject": "The Lie", "text": "It isn't easy living a lie\n Pretending you care\n Wanting to cry\n Hoping that soon the change will come\n Expected to sit afraid to run\n It isn't easy deceiving yourself\n Putting your feelings\n Upon a shelf\n Praying each day you will survive\n That vicious connving\n Bare faced lie."}
