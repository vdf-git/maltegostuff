Irish rise!' the edict rang\nAs when Creation into being sprang!\nNature, not clearly understanding, tried\nTo make a bird that on the air could ride.\nBut naught could baffle the creative plan\nDespite her efforts 'twas almost a man.\nYet he had risen-to the bird a twin\nHad she but fixed a wing upon his chin."}
