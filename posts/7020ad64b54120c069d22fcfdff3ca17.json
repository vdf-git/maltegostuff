{"subject": "On The Brink Of Death", "text": "NOW hath my life across a stormy sea \nLike a frail bark reached that wide port where all \nAre bidden, ere the final reckoning fall \nOf good and evil for eternity. \nNow know I well how that fond phantasy \nWhich made my soul the worshiper and thrall \nOf earthly art, is vain; how criminal \nIs that which all men seek unwillingly. \nThose amorous thoughts which were so lightly dressed, \nWhat are they when the double death is nigh? \nThe one I know for sure, the other dread. \nPainting nor sculpture now can lull to rest \nMy soul that turns to His great love on high, \nWhose arms to clasp us on the cross were spread."}
