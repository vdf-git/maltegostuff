{"subject": "If I Die Young...", "text": "Like the linden tree, words spread their fragrance through the twilight,\nDeep in the words I have spoken,\nAs in the depths of the Ionian,\nI see my face.\n\nI feel no pity for myself,\nI do not lament my fate.\n\nAnd if I die young,\nDo not close my eyes...\nI wish no candles... just let me watch\nThe stars come out in the heavens above me.\n\nIf I die young."}
