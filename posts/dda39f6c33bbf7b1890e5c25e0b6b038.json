{"subject": "Big Game", "text": "\u2014after Richard Brautigan's \"A Candlelion Poem\"\n\nWhat began as wildfire ends up\non a candle wick. In reverse,\nit is contained,\n\na lion head in a hunter's den.\nBig Game.\n\nBigger than one I played\nwith matches and twigs and glass\nin the shade.\n\nWhen I was young, there was no sun\nand I was afraid.\n\nNow, in grownhood, I call the ghost\nto my fragile table, my fleshy supper,\nmy tiny flame.\n\nNot just any old, but THE ghost,\nthe last one I will be,\n\nthe future me,\nfinally the sharpest knife\nin the drawer.\n\nThe pride is proud.\nThe crowd is loud, like garbage dumping\n\nor how a brown bag ripping\nsounds like a shout\nthat tells the town the house\n\nis burning down.\nDrowns out some small folded breath\n\nof otherlife: O that of a lioness licking her cubs to sleep in a dream of\nsavage gold.\n\nO that roaring, not yet and yet\nand not yet dead.\n\nSo many fires start in my head."}
