{"subject": "Lights Out", "text": "\"Lights out\" along the land,\n\"Lights out\" upon the sea.\nThe night must put her hiding hand\nO'er peaceful towns where children sleep,\nAnd peaceful ships that darkly creep\nAcross the waves, as if they were not free. \n\nThe dragons of the air,\nThe hell-hounds of the deep,\nLurking and prowling everywhere,\nGo forth to seek their helpless prey,\nNot knowing whom they maim or slay--\nMad harvesters, who care not what they reap. \n\nOut with the tranquil lights,\nOut with the lights that burn\nFor love and law and human rights!\nSet back the clock a thousand years:\nAll they have gained now disappears,\nAnd the dark ages suddenly return. \n\nKaiser who loosed wild death,\nAnd terror in the night--\nGod grant you draw no quiet breath, \nUntil the madness you began\nIs ended, and long-suffering man,\nSet free from war lords, cries, \"Let there be Light.\""}
