{"subject": "God's-Acre", "text": "I like that ancient Saxon phrase, which calls\n  The burial-ground God's-Acre! It is just;\nIt consecrates each grave within its walls,\n  And breathes a benison o'er the sleeping dust.\n\nGod's-Acre! Yes, that blessed name imparts\n  Comfort to those, who in the grave have sown\nThe seed that they had garnered in their hearts,\n  Their bread of life, alas! no more their own.\n\nInto its furrows shall we all be cast,\n In the sure faith, that we shall rise again\nAt the great harvest, when the archangel's blast\n  Shall winnow, like a fan, the chaff and grain.\n\nThen shall the good stand in immortal bloom,\n In the fair gardens of that second birth;\nAnd each bright blossom mingle its perfume\n With that of flowers, which never bloomed on earth.\n\nWith thy rude ploughahare, Death, turn up the sod,\n And spread the furrow for the seed we sow;\nThis is the field and Acre of our God,\n This is the place where human harvests grow!"}
