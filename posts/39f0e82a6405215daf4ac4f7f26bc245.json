{"subject": "My Daughters", "text": "Through the forests, down by the ponds\n I sit upon a rock, in the early dawn\n Reflection of images, upon the waters\n Bring back fond memories, of my daughters\n\n Like when they were small, and used to play\n Planning some thing new, for the next day\n Running in the house, running back out\n Just letting me know, of their where abouts\n\n So much of the past, one can still miss\n Like taking care of mishaps, you could cure with a kiss\n The new bike, they first learned to ride\n All their pride showing, fear they did hide\n\n All in all, they grew up so fast\n But tucked in my heart, are memories that last\n Of my daughters, they will always be\n In memory only, little children to me"}
