{"subject": "At Dawn", "text": "THE night-long clamour of winds grew still;\nThe forest rested, its foes withdrawn;\nOn sounding ocean and silent hill\nThere crept a sense of the coming dawn.\nA bird awoke on a leaning limb\nAnd fluttered its plumes a moment's space;\nDark purple lay on the sea's far rim:\nThe sky grew pale as a dying face.\nThen all the trees and the rocks and heights\nWith wondering faces watched the East:\nIt seemed an altar hung with lights\nAnd waiting for a vestured priest.\nAnd in that intimate first hour\nWhen land and sea rejoiced as one,\nAnd Nature, like an opening flower,\nGave incense, came the burning sun.\nYet, while the hour of gold went by,\nI saw through all its pageantry\nThe vast indifference of the sky,\nThe heartless beauty of the sea.\nFor wet and wan, and cold and sped\nBeyond the breakers' reach of pearl,\nThere lay a strong man drowned and dead,\nAnd in his arms a drowned white girl."}
