{"subject": "Lover's Gifts Xliii: Dying, You Have Left Behind", "text": "Dying, you have left behind you the great sadness of the Eternal\nin my life. You have painted my thought's horizon with the sunset\ncolours of your departure, leaving a track of tears across the\nearth to love's heaven. Clasped in your dear arms, life and death\nunited in me in a marriage bond.\n    I think I can see you watching there in the balcony with your\nlamp lighted, where the end and the beginning of all things meet.\nMy world went hence through the doors that you opened-you holding\nthe cup of death to my lips, filling it with life from your own."}
