{"subject": "Verses Written In An Alcove", "text": "NOW the moon-beam's trembling lustre\nSilvers o'er the dewy green,\nAnd in soft and shadowy colours\nSweetly paints the checquer'd scene.\n\nHere between the opening branches\nStreams a flood of soften'd light,\nThere the thick and twisted foliage\nSpreads the browner gloom of night.\n\nThere is sure the haunt of fairies,\nIn yon cool Alcove they play;\nCare can never cross the threshold,\nCare was only made for day.\n\nFar from hence be noisy clamour,\nSick disgust and anxious fear;\nPining grief and wasting anguish\nNever keep their vigils here.\n\nTell no tales of sheeted spectres,\nRising from the quiet tomb;\nFairer forms this cell shall visit,\nBrighter visions gild the gloom.\n\nChoral songs and sprightly voices\nEcho from her cell shall call;\nSweeter, sweeter than the murmur\nOf the distant water fall.\n\nEvery ruder gust of passion\nLull'd with music dies away,\nTill within the charmed bosom\nNone but soft affections play:\n\nSoft, as when the evening breezes\nGently stir the poplar grove;\nBrighter than the smile of summer,\nSweeter than the breath of love.\n\nThee, th' inchanted Muse shall follow,\nLISSY! to the rustic cell,\nAnd each careless note repeating\nTune them to her charming shell.\n\nNot the Muse who wreath'd with laurel,\nSolemn stalks with tragic gait,\nAnd in clear and lofty vision\nSees the future births of fate;\n\nNot the maid who crown'd with cypress\nSweeps along in scepter'd pall,\nAnd in sad and solemn accents\nMourns the crested heroe's fall;\n\nBut that other smiling sister,\nWith the blue and laughing eye,\nSinging, in a lighter measure,\nStrains of woodland harmony:\n\nAll unknown to fame or glory,\nEasy, blith and debonair,\nCrown'd with flowers, her careless tresses\nLoosely floating on the air.\n\nThen, when next the star of evening\nSoftly sheds the silent dew,\nLet me in this rustic temple,\nLISSY ! meet the Muse and you."}
