{"subject": "In The Evening", "text": "I\n\nIn the evening of our days,\nWhen the first far stars above\nGlimmer dimmer, through the haze,\nThan the dewy eyes of love,\nShall we mournfully revert\nTo the vanished morns and Mays\nOf our youth, with hearts that hurt,--\nIn the evening of our days?\nII\n\nShall the hand that holds your own\nTill the twain are thrilled as now,\nBe withheld, or colder grown?\nShall my kiss upon your brow\nFalter from its high estate?\nAnd, in all forgetful ways,\nShall we sit apart and wait--\nIn the evening of our days?\nIII\n\nNay, my wife--my life!--the gloom\nShall enfold us velvetwise,\nAnd my smile shall be the groom\nOf the gladness of your eyes:\nGently, gently as the dew\nMingles with the darkening maze,\nI shall fall asleep with you--\nIn the evening of our days."}
