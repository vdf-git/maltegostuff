{"subject": "The Banshee", "text": "As we came down the old boreen,\nRose and I \u2013 Rose and I,\nAt vesper time on Sunday e\u2019en,\nWe heard a banshee cry!\nBeyond the churchyard dim and dark,\n\u2018Neath whispering elms, and yew-trees stark,\nWhere our star shone-a corpse-like spark-\nAgainst the wintry sky.\n\nWe heard and shuddered sick with dread,\nRose and I- Rose and I,\nAs the shrill keening rang o\u2019erhead\nWhere cloud-wrack floated high.\nOur two young hearts long, sorely tried,\nBy poverty and love denied\nStill waiting for some favouring tide,\nAnd now! Death come so nigh.\n\n\u2018Which of us two is called away\nYou or I-You or I?\u201d\nI heard my patient poor love say,\nWith bitter plaintive sigh.\n\u2018Neither, dear girl,\u201d I bravely said,\n\u2018To Mary Mother bow your head,\nAnd cry for help to Her instead,\nNor heed the Banshee\u2019s cry\u2019.\n\nWe raised our hearts in fervent prayer,\nRose and I-Rose and I,\nNor knew our troubles ended there,\nOur happiness came nigh.\nFor \u2018twas the grim old farmer, he-\nMy only kin, rich, miserly,\nWho, dying left his wealth to me-\nFor whom the banshee cried."}
