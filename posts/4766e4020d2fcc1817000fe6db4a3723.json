{"subject": "Arnold Rode Behind", "text": "WE galloped down the sodden track\nClose buttoned 'gainst the wind;\nI took the lead with whip and spur,\nAnd Arnold rode behind.\n\nThe skies were wild; a rending gale\nRan roaring through the trees;\nIt sounded now like shouting hosts,\nAnd now like angry seas.\n\n'Spur on! Spur on!' I turned and cried,\n'The fatal moments fly!'\nI cursed him then-his trembling hand-\nI cursed his bloodshot eye.\n\nI cursed him for the lust of drink\nThat held his will a slave;\nFor skill to tend and mend was his\nTo succour and to save.\n\nI thought of her, the golden girl,\nMy life, my love, nigh spent,\nNigh death, with fever clutching her,\nAnd what his coming meant.\n\nThrough driving rain and tossing trees\nI saw her pale with pain ;\nAnd if my eyes grew wet, perchance\n'Twas not the wet of rain.\n\nI turned on Arnold, and I vowed\nTo pay with coin of hate\nHis ten-mile ride, his boasted skill,\nIf he should prove too late;\n\nI mixed my words with searing scorn,\nAnd turned and told him plain,\nOf how I found him stupid, drugged,\nWith dull and sluggish brain.\n\nAnd how the wasted hours went by-\nI waiting by his side-\nTill he should wake, and be himself,\nAnd mount his horse and ride.\n\nAnd 'Arnold, if she die'-I said-\n'Be yours the lot accurst-\nIn life to thirst, to thirst in death,\nIn Hell to thirst and thirst.'\n\nAnd so with black and bitter words,\nClose-buttoned 'gainst the wind,\nWith whip and spur I galloped on,\nAnd Arnold rode behind.\n\nNo word he said, no answer gave,\nNo bitter curse flung back,\nBut, sagging in the saddle, sank\nA shamed thing in my track.\n\nThe skies were lead, and leaden rain-\nA screen of sullen lead.\nA wind-blown screen, a blinding screen-\nFell down from overhead.\n\nThough cattle die, and pastures fade,\nWith drought on hill and plain,\n'Fore God, I pray I may not see\nThe like of that blind rain!\n\nThe torn leaves swirled about my head;\nThe gum-trees tall and stout\nWaved limbs and tossed tormented crests\nAs in a forest rout.\n\nThe wind was now like hounds a-hunt,\nAnd now like hounds that whined.\nYet ever on and on I rode,\nAnd Arnold rode behind.\n\nAnd soon there rose a mighty noise;\nAbove the wind it roared;\nAnd. bursting through the screen of rain,\nWe came to Kelvin's Ford.\n\nI reined my horse in mute amaze,\nA stunned and stricken man;\nFor 'twixt me and my heart's own love\nA thwarting river ran.\n\nI looked upon its maddened waste;\nI drew a broken breath;\nI said, ' Tis hopeless-ended all-\nTo dare the Ford were death.'\n\nThe wind was like a pack of hounds\nUpon a forest-hunt- . . .\nAnd then I heard a splash of hoofs-\nAnd Arnold rode in front,\n\nHis face was lit-I vow 'twas lit\nLike glorious evening skies;\nAnd, as he turned and smiled, flashed out\nThe manhood from his eyes.\n\nAnd then I knew that through his soul\nA dauntless purpose ran\nAs, shaking shame and sin aside,\nHe rose once more a Man.\n\nHe fought the river inch by inch,\nSet will against its might,\nGave way with it, and came again,\nAnd conquered in the fight.\n\nAnd saved Her . . . conquered Death as well.\n0 Heart-so dull, so blind!-\nOft-times, denied his chance in life,\nThe hero rides behind."}
