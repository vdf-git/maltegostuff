{"subject": "An Autumn Sunset", "text": "I\n\nLEAGUERED in fire\nThe wild black promontories of the coast extend\nTheir savage silhouettes;\nThe sun in universal carnage sets,\nAnd, halting higher,\nThe motionless storm-clouds mass their sullen threats,\nLike an advancing mob in sword-points penned,\nThat, balked, yet stands at bay.\nMid-zenith hangs the fascinated day\nIn wind-lustrated hollows crystalline,\nA wan valkyrie whose wide pinions shine\nAcross the ensanguined ruins of the fray,\nAnd in her lifted hand swings high o'erhead,\nAbove the waste of war,\nThe silver torch-light of the evening star\nWherewith to search the faces of the dead.\n\nII\n\nLagooned in gold,\nSeem not those jetty promontories rather\nThe outposts of some ancient land forlorn,\nUncomforted of morn,\nWhere old oblivions gather,\nThe melancholy, unconsoling fold\nOf all things that go utterly to death\nAnd mix no more, no more\nWith life's perpetually awakening breath?\nShall Time not ferry me to such a shore,\nOver such sailless seas,\nTo walk with hope's slain importunities\nIn miserable marriage? Nay, shall not\nAll things be there forgot,\nSave the sea's golden barrier and the black\nClosecrouching promontories?\nDead to all shames, forgotten of all glories,\nShall I not wander there, a shadow's shade,\nA spectre self-destroyed,\nSo purged of all remembrance and sucked back\nInto the primal void,\nThat should we on that shore phantasmal meet\nI should not know the coming of your feet?"}
