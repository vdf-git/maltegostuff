{"subject": "The Happy Child", "text": "I saw this day sweet flowers grow thick -- \nBut not one like the child did pick.\n\nI heard the packhounds in green park -- \nBut no dog like the child heard bark.\n\nI heard this day bird after bird -- \nBut not one like the child has heard.\n\nA hundred butterflies saw I -- \nBut not one like the child saw fly.\n\nI saw the horses roll in grass -- \nBut no horse like the child saw pass.\n\nMy world this day has lovely been -- \nBut not like what the child has seen."}
