{"subject": "Lament Of The Maple Tree", "text": "I laid me down one day in June;\nIt was late-long after noon-\nA very sultry summer's eve, \nSuch times the senses oft deceive. \nThe place was 'neath a maple tree,\nSoon from all cares and troubles free,\nBy a gentle, kindly slumber,\nNo more our sorrows we could number.\nBut we heard a plaintive wail,\nSuch as we find in fairy tale ;\nIt was the genius of the tree,\nWho, in sad guise, appeared to me.\nAnd then she sadly did give vent\nUnto this awful, grave lament,\n'Though I am gay in month of June,\nAll decked in green ; yet very soon,\nAlas ! my beauty will be faded,\nAnd my charms be all degraded,\nFor is my time of glory brief ;\nSo often flattered is my leaf.\nIn Canada, so broad and free,\nAll poets sing of the maple tree.\nHigh I stand, in their opinion,\nEmblem of the New Dominion.\nThe reason I do them upbraid,\nSome never slept beneath my shade ;\nAnd yet they take the liberty\nTo chant about the maple tree. \nThey dare to poetize my leaf -\nis the source of all my grief.\nI think their praises all so rude, \nAnd as but base in gratitude ;\nSo often hackneyed is my name,\nThat every fall I burn with shame-\nLike maiden's cheek which blushes red\n\nWhen vain rash youth asks her to wed.\nThen do these foolish ones descry \nIn me fresh beauty, and they sigh,\nAnd then renew their songs of praise-\nBut unto me now sad their lays ;\nFor then I know my days are brief,\n'Tis hectic flush upon my leaf.\nTrue poets, then, should mournful sing,\nWhen the destroyer's on the wing ;\nFor then I know my leaves of gold\nWill all soon mingle with the mould.\nNo one does ever think to praise\nThe fell destroyer when he slays ;\nNo one rejoice in the flushed cheek,\nWhen the poor girl is low and weak.\nPerhaps they'll say, and it is true,\nIn Spring my glory I'll renew ;\nBut' tis poor comfort after all\nTo lose my offspring every Fall.\nSmall consolation to mother\nTo tell her that soon another\nWill replace her fond darling boy,\nWho has been source of all her joy.\nBut you know all about my wood,\nYou know that it is strong and good ;\nAnd I have full many a curl,\nAnd pleasing eye and charming nurl.\nSome love me as fond nature grain'd\nAnd some prefer my beauties stain'd ;\nBut my dear friend I hope that you\nMy varied shades like pure and true,\nFor of the woods you know the staple,\nStoutest and best, is good maple.\nThe youth my sugar eat with glee \nAnd old maids love me in their tea.\nIn me do various uses meet-\nIn summer shade, in winter heat,\nFor I do make a glorious blaze,\nAll worthy of the poet's lays ;\nBut to their praises I'll be deaf\nIf more they harp about my leaf-\n\nThey call me gay when I am sober, \nTo me 'tis gloomy month, October. \nBut saints on earth, when they die \nHope for true bliss beyond the sky, \nSo winter does bring no alarms \nThough it strip bare my trunk and arms, \nFor now I know that time will bring\nMore glorious foliage in the spring. \nThen, all nature will rejoice, \nTriumphing with glorious voice,\nAnd birds will, in my branches, sing\nHosannas to the lovely spring.\n\n[The nurls and bird's eyes and curls were highly prized\nin furniture thirty years ago, when we used the smooth plain."}
