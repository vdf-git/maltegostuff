{"subject": "In The Haunts Of Bass And Bream", "text": "I\n\nDreams come true, and everything\nIs fresh and lusty in the spring.\nIn groves that smell like ambergris,\nWind-songs, bird-songs, never cease.\nGo with me down by the stream,\nHaunt of bass and purple bream;\nFeel the pleasure, keen and sweet,\nWhen the cool waves lap your feet;\nCatch the breath of moss and mould,\nHear the grosbeak's whistle bold;\nSee the heron all alone\nMidstream on a slippery stone,\nOr, on some decaying log,\nSpearing snail or water-frog.\nSee the shoals of sun-perch shine\nAmong the pebbles smooth and fine,\nWhilst the sprawling turtles swim\nIn the eddies cool and dim!\nII\n\nThe busy nuthatch climbs his tree,\nAround the great bole spirally,\nPeeping into wrinkles gray,\nUnder ruffled lichens gay,\nLazily piping one sharp note\nFrom his silver mail\u00ebd throat;\nAnd down the wind the catbird's song\nA slender medley trails along.\nHere a grackle chirping low,\nThere a crested vireo;\nDeep in tangled underbrush\nFlits the shadowy hermit-thrush;\nCoos the dove, the robin trills,\nThe crows caw from the airy hills;\nPurple finch and pewee gray,\nBluebird, swallow, oriole gay,-\nEvery tongue of Nature sings;\nThe air is palpitant with wings.\nHalcyon prophecies come to pass\nIn the haunts of bream and bass.\nIII\n\nBubble, bubble, flows the stream,\nLike an old tune through a dream.\nNow I cast my silken line;\nSee the gay lure spin and shine,\nWhile with delicate touch I feel\nThe gentle pulses of the reel.\nHalcyon laughs and cuckoo cries;\nThrough its leaves the plane-tree sighs.\nBubble, bubble, flows the stream,\nHere a glow and there a gleam;\nCoolness all about me creeping,\nFragrance all my senses steeping,-\nSpicewood, sweet-gum, sassafras,\nCalamus and water-grass,\nGiving up their pungent smells,\nDrawn from Nature's secret wells;\nOn the cool breath of the morn,\nPerfume of the cock-spur thorn,\nGreen spathes of the dragon-root,\nIndian turnip's tender shoot,\nDogwood, red-bud, elder, ash,\nSnowy gleam and purple flash,\nHillside thickets, densely green,\nThat the partridge revels in!\nIV\n\nI see the morning-glory's curl,\nThe curious star-flower's pointed whorl;\nHear the woodpecker, rap-a-tap!\nSee him with his cardinal's cap!\nAnd the querulous, leering jay,\nHow he clamors for a fray!\nPatiently I draw and cast,\nKeenly expectant till, at last,\nComes a flash, down in the stream,\nNever made by perch or bream;\nThen a mighty weight I feel,-\nSings the line and whirs the reel!\nV\n\nOut of a giant tulip-tree\nA great gay blossom falls on me;\nOld gold and fire its petals are,\nIt flashes like a falling star.\nA big blue heron flying by\nLooks at me with a greedy eye.\nI see a striped squirrel shoot\nInto a hollow maple root;\nA bumblebee with mail all rust,\nAnd thighs puffed out with anther-dust,\nClasps a shrinking bloom about,\nAnd draws her amber sweetness out.\nVI\n\nBubble, bubble, flows the stream,\nLike a song heard in a dream.\nA white-faced hornet hurtles by,\nLags a turquoise butterfly,-\nOne intent on prey and treasure,\nOne afloat on tides of pleasure!\nSunshine arrows, swift and keen,\nPierce the burr-oak's helmet green.\nVII\n\nI follow where my victim leads\nThrough tangles of rank water-weeds,\nO'er stone and root and knotty log,\nO'er faithless bits of reedy bog.\nI wonder, will he ever stop?\nThe reel hums like a humming top!\nThrough graceful curves he sweeps the line,\nHe sulks, he starts, his colors shine,\nWhilst I, all flushed and breathless, tear\nThrough lady-fern and maidenhair,\nAnd in my straining fingers feel\nThe throbbing of the rod and reel!\nA thin sandpiper, wild with fright,\nGoes into ecstasies of flight;\nA gaunt green bittern quits the rushes,\nThe yellow-throat its warbling hushes;\nBubble, bubble, flows the stream,\nLike an old tune through a dream!\nVIII\n\nAt last he tires, I reel him in;\nI see the glint of scale and fin.\nThe crinkled halos round him break,\nHe leaves gay bubbles in his wake.\nI raise the rod, I shorten line,\nAnd safely land him,-he is mine!\nIX\n\nThe belted halcyon laughs, the wren\nComes twittering from his bushy den;\nThe turtle sprawls upon its log,\nI hear the booming of a frog.\nLiquidambar's keen perfume,\nSweet-punk, calamus, tulip-bloom;\nDancing wasp and dragon-fly,\nWood-thrush whistling tenderly;\nDamp cool breath of moss and mould,\nNoontide's influence manifold;\nGlimpses of a cloudless sky,-\nSoothe me as I resting lie.\nBubble, bubble, flows the stream,\nLike low music through a dream."}
