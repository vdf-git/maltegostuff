{"subject": "The Green Bowl", "text": "This little bowl is like a mossy pool \nIn a Spring wood, where dogtooth violets grow \nNodding in chequered sunshine of the trees; \nA quiet place, still, with the sound of birds, \nWhere, though unseen, is heard the endless song \nAnd murmur of the never resting sea. \n'T was winter, Roger, when you made this cup, \nBut coming Spring guided your eager hand \nAnd round the edge you fashioned young green leaves, \nA proper chalice made to hold the shy \nAnd little flowers of the woods. And here \nThey will forget their sad uprooting, lost \nIn pleasure that this circle of bright leaves \nShould be their setting; once more they will dream \nThey hear winds wandering through lofty trees \nAnd see the sun smiling between the leaves."}
