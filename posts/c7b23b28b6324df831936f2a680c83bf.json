{"subject": "A POEM", "text": "It's all right,\nYou did your work, gardener,\nAnd so did you, hundred-year-old captain.\nAnd you, carer of the sick, you did your work too.\nBe content with that, be glad,\nTake a rest and begin again.\n\nOur paths cross and I recognize you,\nJust as I recognize others, and yet others.\nWe aren't kept separate\nBy unbearable suffering\nOr dangerous streets or arid plains\nDemanding to know what we're up to.\nTake a rest and begin again.\n\nI look at the dead,\nI look at the living.\nWe call up memories\nAnd smile at the kids passing by,\nAnd drink water from small cups.\nIf there's any fig brandy around, we drink it,\nWith great gusto.\n\nThe chairs and the stools are their considerate selves,\nDoing their work even in the bitter cold.\nThe motor-engines of the bus help us,\nAs do the overhead wires of the tram.\nWe lie on the ground and listen, open-mouthed,\nTo the crows and the blackbirds."}
