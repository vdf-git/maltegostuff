{"subject": "San Diego and Matisse", "text": "1. INSIDE FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF A TREE\n\nBeautiful women in smoky blue culottes\nlying around on fluffy pink pillows\nbeneath windows onto charming views,\nsea views, seasonal leaves and trees.\nInside is outside and outside inside.\nSmell of saltwater swimming in the room.\n2. OUTSIDE FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF A ROCKING CHAIR\n\nShadow of lighthouse along the beach.\nWhales spotted every day lately\nthough winter's two months yet.\nThe evening is as warm as an interior.\nSilverlight lagoonlight, snorkeling light.\nAnd a line of joggers against last light.\nBlue smoke snaking up the pink sky."}
