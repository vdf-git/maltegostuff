{"subject": "The Warrior", "text": "AH! shall th' enamour'd muse recite\nThy vent'rous glories gain'd in fight?\nWhen following fierce the din of war,\nLur'd by Bellona's trump from far,\nThy men victorious onward led\nO'er many a smoking field, \nAnd chang'd to heroes!--freely bled\nNear thee, asham'd to yield.\n\nOr drooping low her soaring wing,\nFalt'ring touch a sadder string,\nWeeping, shall she not relate\nThe harsh decrees of stubborn fate?\nSinking from embattl'd story,\nHow, with many a wound aggriev'd,\nWeep that form which speaks thy glory,\nScars alone should have atchiev'd!\n\nYet viewing thee with grief inspir'd,\nAgain she feels her fancy fir'd;\nAgain with rapture loves to trace\nTh' immortal glories of thy race:\nShe sees the hero of her lay,\nWhile mem'ry points to fame,\nAll lesser regrets fade away,\nFor Triumph marks his name!\n\nWhen erst a youth, thy dawning years\nFill'd all around with hopes and fears;\nCourage and Virtue were combin'd,\nBut Vanity still intertwin'd:\nFrom Passion all thine errors sprung,\nLuxuriant nature's child!\nFor Passion o'er thy reason flung\nHer chain of flow'rets wild.\n\nVainly to stop thy wild career,\nHad Prudence caution'd thee to fear,\nLike some bright comet darting by\nThe lesser spangles of the sky,\nThy course no more might be detain'd,\nTho' boding evil near,\nBut onward still would be maintain'd,\nDestruction in the rear. \n\nThy fame victorious early swell'd,\nAmerica thy feats beheld;\nTo raise the youthful warrior's pride,\nFortune her various honours tried!\nHomage in all thy footsteps trod,\nIn ev'ry clime and state,\nIn crouds to look and move the god--\nAh! 'twas a test too great! \n\nThe hero fell;--ah! muse forbear,\nForbear to shed th' ignoble tear:\nPhaeton, who sought to rule the world,\nFor vanity was downward hurl'd.\nA mortal is a mortal still,\nWhate'er the prize he gain;\nHe hath not pow'r , but only will ,\nPerfection to attain.\n\nThen weep not, Muse, thy fav'rite's fall,\nMisfortune is the lot of all;\nAnd Merit, struggling with its foes,\nBut prouder from oppression grows;\nThen baleful Envy hovers round,\nTo blast the soldier's wreath,\nTo rob the brows with honour crown'd,\nNor leave him fame in death!\n\nTrue, hate unkind and slander foul\nCombine to crush the soaring soul,\nBut, like a bright and vig'rous flame,\nIt still shall rise to gild thy name,\nConfuse, expose the ranc'rous band,\nAnd shine in triumphs new,\nTheir lowliest rev'rence yet command\nThe friendship of a few.\n\nThen hasten, youth! from British clime,\nLet blushing honours croud thy time!\nHaste! and shortly be repaid\nThose glories thou did'st rashly fade;\nRetire awhile, let Malice spend\nIts idle rage and hate,\nAnd providence shall be thy friend,\nAnd mindful of thy fate.\n\nShadows in youth we all pursue,\nCovet the false, disdain the true;\nPassion in her trappings vain,\nLures the hero to his bane;\nBut pale Experience, sternly keen,\nPoints out youthful folly,\nThen, amaz'd, we quit the scene,\nTo mourn in melancholy.\n\nIt cannot be, a day so bright\nShould sink in endless gloomy night;\nIt cannot be, so bright a morn\nOf all its glories should be shorn!\nIt must not be, a noon so glorious\nClouds eternal should o'ercast,\nNor thy laurel-wreath victorious\nPerish in the envious blast!\n\nThen let, oh! Muse, thy tears be dry,\nWhile Hope forbids the rising sigh--\nI tell thee, tho' a cruel blow\nThrew thy comely hero low;\nHis eve in glitt'ring vest shall smile,\nDispers'd the transient gloom,\nAnd gaily to his native isle\nBright beams his path illume!"}
