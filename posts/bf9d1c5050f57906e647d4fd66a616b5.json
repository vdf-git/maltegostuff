{"subject": "L'Envoi", "text": "We've finished up the filthy war;\nWe've won what we were fighting for . . .\n(Or have we? I don't know).\nBut anyway I have my wish:\nI'm back upon the old Boul' Mich',\nAnd how my heart's aglow!\nThough in my coat's an empty sleeve,\nAh! do not think I ever grieve\n(The pension for it, I believe,\nWill keep me on the go).\n\nSo I'll be free to write and write,\nAnd give my soul to sheer delight,\nTill joy is almost pain;\nTo stand aloof and watch the throng,\nAnd worship youth and sing my song\nOf faith and hope again;\nTo seek for beauty everywhere,\nTo make each day a living prayer\nThat life may not be vain.\n\nTo sing of things that comfort me,\nThe joy in mother-eyes, the glee\nOf little ones at play;\nThe blessed gentleness of trees,\nOf old men dreaming at their ease\nSoft afternoons away;\nOf violets and swallows' wings,\nOf wondrous, ordinary things\nIn words of every day.\n\nTo rhyme of rich and rainy nights,\nWhen like a legion leap the lights\nAnd take the town with gold;\nOf taverns quaint where poets dream,\nOf cafes gaudily agleam,\nAnd vice that's overbold;\nOf crystal shimmer, silver sheen,\nOf soft and soothing nicotine,\nOf wine that's rich and old,\n\nOf gutters, chimney-tops and stars,\nOf apple-carts and motor-cars,\nThe sordid and sublime;\nOf wealth and misery that meet\nIn every great and little street,\nOf glory and of grime;\nOf all the living tide that flows --\nFrom princes down to puppet shows --\nI'll make my humble rhyme.\n\nSo if you like the sort of thing\nOf which I also like to sing,\nJust give my stuff a look;\nAnd if you don't, no harm is done --\n\nIn writing it I've had my fun;\nGood luck to you and every one --\nAnd so\n\n            Here ends my book."}
