{"subject": "Light Between The Trees", "text": "Long, long, long the trail\nThrough the brooding forest-gloom,\nDown the shadowy, lonely vale\nInto silence, like a room\nWhere the light of life has fled,\nAnd the jealous curtains close\nRound the passionless repose\nOf the silent dead.\n\nPlod, plod, plod away,\nStep by step in mouldering moss;\nThick branches bar the day\nOver languid streams that cross\nSoftly, slowly, with a sound\nIn their aimless creeping\nLike a smothered weeping,\nThrough the enchanted ground.\n\n\"Yield, yield, yield thy quest,\"\nWhispers through the woodland deep;\n\"Come to me and be at rest;\n\"I am slumber, I am sleep.\"\nThen the weary feet would fail,\nBut the never-daunted will\nUrges \"Forward, forward still!\n\"Press along the trail!\"\n\nBreast, breast, breast the slope!\nSee, the path is growing steep.\nHark! a little song of hope\nWhen the stream begins to leap.\nThough the forest, far and wide,\nStill shuts out the bending blue,\nWe shall finally win through,\nCross the long divide.\n\nOn, on, onward tramp!\nWill the journey never end?\nOver yonder lies the camp;\nWelcome waits us there, my friend.\nCan we reach it ere the night?\nUpward, upward, never fear!\nLook, the summit must be near;\nSee the line of light!\n\nRed, red, red the shine\nOf the splendour in the west,\nGlowing through the ranks of pine,\nClear along the mountain-crest!\nLong, long, long the trail\nOut of sorrow's lonely vale;\nBut at last the traveller sees\nLight between the trees!"}
