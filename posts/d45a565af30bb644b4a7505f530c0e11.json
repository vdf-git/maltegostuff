{"subject": "Rags", "text": "We called him 'Rags.' He was just a cur,\nBut twice, on the Western Line,\nThat little old bunch of faithful fur\nHad offered his life for mine.\n\nAnd all that he got was bones and bread,\nOr the leavings of soldier grub,\nBut he'd give his heart for a pat on the head,\nOr a friendly tickle and rub\n\nAnd Rags got home with the regiment,\nAnd then, in the breaking away-\nWell, whether they stole him, or whether he went,\nI am not prepared to say.\n\nBut we mustered out, some to beer and gruel\nAnd some to sherry and shad,\nAnd I went back to the Sawbones School,\nWhere I still was an undergrad.\n\nOne day they took us budding M. D.s\nTo one of those institutes\nWhere they demonstrate every new disease\nBy means of bisected brutes.\n\nThey had one animal tacked and tied\nAnd slit like a full-dressed fish,\nWith his vitals pumping away inside\nAs pleasant as one might wish.\n\nI stopped to look like the rest, of course,\nAnd the beast's eyes levelled mine;\nHis short tail thumped with a feeble force,\nAnd he uttered a tender whine.\n\nIt was Rags, yes, Rags! who was martyred there,\nWho was quartered and crucified,\nAnd he whined that whine which is doggish prayer\nAnd he licked my hand and died.\n\nAnd I was no better in part nor whole\nThan the gang I was found among,\nAnd his innocent blood was on the soul\nWhich he blessed with his dying tongue.\n\nWell I've seen men go to courageous death\nIn the air, on sea, on land!\nBut only a dog would spend his breath\nIn a kiss for his murderer's hand.\n\nAnd if there's no heaven for love like that,\nFor such four-legged fealty-well\nIf I have any choice, I tell you flat,\nI'll take my chance in hell."}
