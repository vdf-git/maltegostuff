{"subject": "Lay Back The Darkness", "text": "My father in the night shuffling from room to room\non an obscure mission through the hallway.\n\nHelp me, spirits, to penetrate his dream\nand ease his restless passage.\n\nLay back the darkness for a salesman\nwho could charm everything but the shadows,\n\nan immigrant who stands on the threshold\nof a vast night\n\nwithout his walker or his cane\nand cannot remember what he meant to say,\n\nthough his right arm is raised, as if in prophecy,\nwhile his left shakes uselessly in warning.\n\nMy father in the night shuffling from room to room\nis no longer a father or a husband or a son,\n\nbut a boy standing on the edge of a forest\nlistening to the distant cry of wolves,\n\nto wild dogs,\nto primitive wingbeats shuddering in the treetops."}
