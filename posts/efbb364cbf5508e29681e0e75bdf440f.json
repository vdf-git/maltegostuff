{"subject": "To Mrs. King, On Her Kind Present To The Author, A Patchwork Counterpane Of Her Own Making", "text": "The Bard, if e'er he feel at all,\nMust sure be quickened by a call\nBoth on his heart and head,\nTo pay with tuneful thanks the care\nAnd kindness of a lady fair \nWho deigns to deck his bed.\n\nA bed like this, in ancient time,\nOn Ida's barren top sublime,\n(As Homer's Epic shows),\nComposed of sweetest vernal flowers,\nWithout the aid of sun or showers,\nFor Jove and Juno rose.\n\nLess beautiful, however gay,\nIs that which in the scorching day\nReceives the weary swain\nWho, laying his long scythe aside,\nSleeps on some bank with daisies pied,\nTill roused to toil again.\n\nWhat labours of the loom I see!\nLooms numberless have groaned for me!\nShould every maiden come\nTo scramble for the patch that bears\nThe impress of the robe she wears,\nThe bell would toll for some.\n\nAnd oh, what havoc would ensue!\nThis bright display of every hue\nAll in a moment fled!\nAs if a storm should strip the bowers\nOf all their tendrils, leaves, and flowers,--\nEach pocketing a shred.\n\nThanks, then, to every gentle Fair,\nWho will not come to peck me bare\nAs bird of borrowed feather, \nAnd thanks to one, above them all,\nThe gentle Fair of Pertenhall,\nWho put the whole together."}
