{"subject": "At Twilight", "text": "Heart of my heart! canst thou hear? canst thou hear?\nAwake! it is June; and the violets peer\nWhere the old acorns lie and the leaves of last year.\n\nAwake! It is I, it is I who have come\nTo arouse thee, to kiss thee, to guide thy feet home.\n\nI call and I hearken: the twilight is dumb.\n\nO, surely thou hearest my far-reaching cry!\nO come and be glad of the grass and the sky\nAnd the greenwood we knew long ago, thou and I!\n\nI cry and I hearken; a little wind stirs\nThrough the trees: then again the great silence is hers:\nAnd the new moon drops under the silver-tipped firs:\n\nOnly, over the hill, on the hillside, I know\nThat it pauses to watch for a while, ere it go,\nThe roof of her House where the young grasses grow."}
