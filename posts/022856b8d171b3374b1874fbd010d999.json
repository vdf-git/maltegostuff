{"subject": "Love The Universal Call", "text": "Love is the universal call.\n the universal feeling,\n that wishes to be received by all.\n Love is what eases pain,\n makes its sharpness dull.\n Love is what brings lovers together,\n from their individual souls.\n Love is what saves the maiden,\n and cheats evils gain.\n Love can be selfish when one loves one's self.\n But self love is taken for granted,\n and can never really be felt.\n Love cannot be measured or weighed upon the scales,\n but felt in the heart from the joy of someone else."}
