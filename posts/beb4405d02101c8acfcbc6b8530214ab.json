{"subject": "Ch 03 On The Excellence Of Contentment Story 04", "text": "One of the kings of Persia had sent an able physician to wait upon the Mustafa, the benediction of Allah and peace be on him; and he remained for some years in the Arab country without anyone coming to him to make a trial of his ability or desiring to be treated by him. He went to the Prophet, salutation to him, and complained that although he had been sent to treat the companions, none of them had up to this time taken notice of him or required the services incumbent upon him. The Apostle, salutation to him, replied: \u2018It is a law with these people not to eat until appetite overpowers them and when some of it yet remains they withdraw their hands from food.\u2019 The doctor said: \u2018This is the cause of health\u2019, and kissing the earth of service departed.\n\n              The sage begins to speak  \n              Or points his fingers to the dish  \n              When silence would be dangerous  \n              Or abstinance would bring on death.  \n              No doubt his wisdom is in speaking  \n              And his eating bears the fruit of health."}
