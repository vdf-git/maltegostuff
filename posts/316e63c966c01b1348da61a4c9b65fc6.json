{"subject": "Reflections", "text": "When I looked into your eyes, \nI saw a garden \nWith peonies, and tinkling pagodas, \nAnd round-arched bridges \nOver still lakes. \nA woman sat beside the water \nIn a rain-blue, silken garment. \nShe reached through the water \nTo pluck the crimson peonies \nBeneath the surface,\nBut as she grasped the stems, \nThey jarred and broke into white-green ripples, \nAnd as she drew out her hand, \nThe water-drops dripping from it \nStained her rain-blue dress like tears."}
