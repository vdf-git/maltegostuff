{"subject": "Had I The Choice", "text": "Had I the choice to tally greatest bards, \nTo limn their portraits, stately, beautiful, and emulate at will, \nHomer with all his wars and warriors--Hector, Achilles, Ajax, \nOr Shakespeare's woe-entangled Hamlet, Lear, Othello--Tennyson's fair ladies, \nMeter or wit the best, or choice conceit to weild in perfect rhyme, delight of singers; \nThese, these, O sea, all these I'd gladly barter, \nWould you the undulation of one wave, its trick to me transfer, \nOr breathe one breath of yours upon my verse, \nAnd leave its odor there."}
