{"subject": "Held At Gunpoint", "text": "Two months ago I decided to visit another state.\nI thought it would be fun but it turned out not to be so great.\nAs I walked by Lindsay Lohan's house, I heard a loud cry.\nI ran in her yard and saw her being held at gunpoint by a strange guy.\nHe was enraged and he wanted her dead.\nHe threatened to pull the trigger as he held the gun to her head.\nI tried to reason with him but he shot me in the shoulder.\nI fell to the ground and decided to make a move that was bolder.\nWhen I got up, I threw a handful of dirt in his eyes.\nI kicked the gun out of his hand and then I clobbered the guy.\nLindsay offered me a reward but I turned it down.\nI already got a reward just by knowing that she's still around."}
