As always\nthe beginning is shrouded in darkness.\n\nIts shadow falls across sun-drenched floor boards\nwhich are infiltrated by woodworm\nwriting the endless genesis of anobium punctatum.\n\nThe artist against the back wall is no more than 23\nand no taller than an index finger,\ndressed up, it appears, by travelling clowns\n\nin lace, cambric and slouched velvet hat,\na proper dandy, were it not for the hob-nailed boots\npeering out from under his robe.\n\nOnly the tools of the trade: mortar and pestle,\nplank table, palette on a hook\ninstead of Persian carpets, fruit bowls from Delft,\n\nno mappa mundi but outlines and faint marks\nof unknown territories, river beds, caravan routes\non the discoloured whitewash.\n\nA paint brush is poised like a surgical blade\nabout to make an incision in the heart of the world\nin undying hunger for more world\n\non a canvas small enough to vanish inside my briefcase\ntogether with panel, artist and brush -\nthe knife that dissects the shadow."}
