{"subject": "Barrenness", "text": "The same road,\nThe same houses,\nHeld together by profound exertion,\nThe same silence.\nWe used to say:\nTomorrow it will die,\nAnd there will awaken\nFrom every house\nYoung children's voices,\nBursting forth, with the daylight, onto the road\nAnd they will mock our yesterday,\nour grumbling women,\nOur dead and lusterless eyes.\nThey will not know what are memories,\nThey will not understand the ancient path,\nAnd they will laugh because they do not ask\nWhy they laugh.\nWe used to say:\nTomorrow we will understand what we say;\nThe seasons will bring us together\nHere a friend\nAnd there some shy, retiring one.\nYesterday our desires were strong\nAnd maybe we did not mean\nWhat we used to say.\nToday the seasons have brought us together\nThat friend\nWithout a friend,\nThat desire\nImpudent and unashamed\nAnd on the road,\nthe same road,\nThe same houses,\nHeld together by profound exertion.\nThe same silence.\nAnd there\nBehind closed windows\nwere the sunken, listless eyes,\nWaiting for the children,\nAnd afraid that the daylight\nWould pass down the road."}
