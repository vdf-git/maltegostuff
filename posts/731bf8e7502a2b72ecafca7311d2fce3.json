{"subject": "The Musical Ass", "text": "The fable which I now present,\nOccurred to me by accident:\nAnd whether bad or excellent,\nIs merely so by accident.\n\nA stupid ass this morning went\nInto a field by accident:\nAnd cropped his food, and was content,\nUntil he spied by accident\nA flute, which some oblivious gent\nHad left behind by accident;\nWhen, sniffling it with eager scent,\nHe breathed on it by accident,\nAnd made the hollow instrument\nEmit a sound by accident.\n'Hurrah, hurrah! exclaimed the brute,\n'How cleverly I play the flute!'\n\nA fool, in spite of Nature's bent,\nMay shine for once - by accident."}
