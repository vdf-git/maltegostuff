{"subject": "All The Rage", "text": "A common wayside flower it grew,\nUnhandsome and unnoticed too,\nExcept in deprecation\nThat such an herb unreared by toil,\nProlific cumberer of the soil,\nDefied extermination.\n\nIts gorgeous blooms were never stirred\nBy honey-bee nor humming-bird\nIn their corollas dipping;\nBut they from clover white and red\nDelicious nectar drew instead\nIn dainty rounds of sipping.\n\nNo place its own euphonious name\nWithin the catalogue might claim\nOf any flora-lover;\nFor, in the scores of passers-by,\nAs yet no true artistic eye\nIts beauty could discover.\n\nThe reaper with his sickle keen\nAimed at its crest of gold and green\nWith spiteful stroke relentless,\nAnd would have rooted from the ground\nThe 'Solidago'--blossom-crowned,\nBut gaudy, rank, and scentless.\n\nBut everything must have its day--\nAnd since some fickle _devotee_\nOr myrmidon of Fashion\nDeclares that this obnoxious weed,\nFrom wild, uncultivated seed,\nShall be the 'ruling passion,'\n\nEffusive schoolgirls dote on it;\nWhose 'frontispieces' infinite\nThat need no decoration\nAre hid beneath its golden dust,\nTill many a fine, symmetric bust\nIs lost to admiration.\n\nSmart dudes and ladies' men--the few\nWho wish they could be ladies too--\nDisplay a sprig of yellow\nConspicuous in their buttonhole,\nTo captivate a maiden soul\nOr vex some other fellow.\n\nAnd spinsters of uncertain age\nAre clamoring now for 'all the rage'\nTo give a dash of color\nTo their complexions, which appear\nTo be the hue they hold so dear--\nExcept a trifle duller.\n\nThat _negligee_ 'blue-stocking' friend,\nWho never cared her time to spend\nOn mysteries of the toilet,\nNow wears a sumptuous bouquet\nAnd shakes your hand a mile away\nFor fear that you will spoil it.\n\nDelightful widows, dressed in black,\nComplain with modest sighs they lack\nThat coveted expression,\nThat sort of Indian Summer air\nWhich 'relicts' always ought to wear\nBy general concession;\n\nAnd so lugubrious folds of crape\nAre crimped and twisted into shape\nWith graceful heads of yellow,\nThat give a winsome toning down\nTo sombre hat and sable gown--\nIn autumn tintings mellow.\n\nAlas, we only hate the weed!\nAnd think that it must be, indeed,\nThe ladies' last endeavor\nTo match the gentlemen, who flaunt\nThat odious dried tobacco plant\nAt which they puff forever."}
