{"subject": "Hymn Iii", "text": "There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God.\n-Hebrews 4:9\nOh how I languish to possess,\nA safe and permanent abode!\nTo rest in unmolested peace,\nAnd cast my care on thee, my God.\n\nIn thee I joy, in thee I rest,\nThough all inferior comforts fail;\nNo hopeless anguish heaves my breast,\nAnd no tormenting fears assail.\n\nTo thee with confidence I look,\nAnd calmly wait thy promised aid;\nI rest securely on that Rock,\nOn which Almighty help is laid.\n\nOh may I on His firmness stand,\nThe ground of my immortal hope;\nOr nobly rise, at his command,\nTo Pisgah's heaven-aspiring top.\n\nThat I may with ecstatic view,\nMy future heritage descry,\nWhere pleasures spring forever new,\nAnd perfect love shall never die."}
