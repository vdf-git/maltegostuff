{"subject": "Prayer For Friends", "text": "Dear Lord, I thank Thee for my friends you gave, \nThe precious moments spent without frowns \nThe companionship we all have shared, \nThe tears and smiles we all have shown. \nLet me see, let me ever greet \nWith a friendly smile those whom I meet! \nGrant that I find new friends each succeeding day \nAnd make me worthy of them, Lord I pray. \nDear Lord, when from this life we'll leave, \nFrom my dear friends, separate me not; \nWhen we'll pass away to the Great Beyond \nCall us to Thy heavenly Throne so grand."}
