{"subject": "Awake", "text": "Calm as that moonbeam on the wall,\nSleep broods on baby's eyes;\nArms, hush'd and still, but pulsing quick,\nEnfold him as he lies;\nMy brain is full of thronging thoughts,\nStrange passions thrill my breast,\nMy heart aches with a load of love\nThat will not let me rest.\n\nThe dim years stand about my bed,\nThey neither smile nor weep;\nLike softest kisses, on my face\nThe little fingers creep.\nI hear slow footfalls, in the night\nOf fates upon his track,\u2014\nO love, I cannot let you go!\nI cannot keep you back!\n\nLord, let him shelter in my arms,\nOr take us both to Thine;\nOr, if a troublous life must come,\nMake all the trouble mine:\nOr let thy sharp swords pierce my heart\nTo blunt them for the child,\u2014\nWhat care I, Lord, for stain and shame,\nSo he keep undefiled!\n\nNay, Lord, I know not what I ask\u2014\nI know not how to pray:\nHear Thou the crying mother-soul,\nAnd not the words I say.\nDo Thou what seemeth good to Thee,\nSo he be spared from sin;\nAnd, oh! if love can aught avail,\nLet mine be counted in."}
