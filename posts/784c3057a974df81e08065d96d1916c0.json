{"subject": "The Intellectual", "text": "What should the wars do with these jigging fools?\nThe man behind the book may not be man, \nHis own man or the book\u2019s or yet the time\u2019s, \nBut still be whole, deciding what he can \nIn praise of politics or German rimes; \nBut the intellectual lights a cigarette \nAnd offers it lit to the lady, whose odd smile \nIs the merest hyphen\u2014lest he should forget \nWhat he has been resuming all the while. \nHe talks to overhear, she to withdraw \nTo some interior feminine fireside \nWhere the back arches, beauty puts forth a paw \nLike a black puma stretching in velvet pride, \nMaking him think of cats, a stray of which \nSome days sets up a howling in his brain, \nPure interference such as this neat bitch \nSeems to create from listening disdain. \nBut talk is all the value, the release, \nTalk is the very fillip of an act, \nThe frame and subject of the masterpiece \nUnder whose film of age the face is cracked. \nHis own forehead glows like expensive wood, \nBut back of it the mind is disengaged, \nSelf-sealing clock recording bad and good \nAt constant temperature, intact, unaged. \nBut strange, his body is an open house \nInviting every passerby to stay; \nThe city to and fro beneath his brows \nWanders and drinks and chats from night to day. \nThink of a private thought, indecent room \nWhere one might kiss his daughter before bed! \nLife is embarrassed; shut the family tomb, \nConsole your neighbor for his recent dead; \nDo something! die in Spain or paint a green \nGouache, go into business (Rimbaud did), \nOr start another Little Magazine, \nOr move in with a woman, have a kid. \nInvulnerable, impossible, immune, \nDo what you will, your will will not be done \nBut dissipate the light of afternoon \nTill evening flickers like the midnight sun, \nAnd midnight shouts and dies: I\u2019d rather be \nA milkman walking in his sleep at dawn \nBearing fat quarts of cream, and so be free, \nCrossing alone and cold from lawn to lawn. \nI\u2019d rather be a barber and cut hair \nThan walk with you in gilt museum halls, \nYou and the puma-lady, she so rare \nExhaling her silk soul upon the walls. \nGo take yourselves apart, but let me be \nThe fault you find with everyman. I spit, \nI laugh, I fight; and you, l\u2019homme qui r\u00eet; \nSwallow your stale saliva, and still sit."}
