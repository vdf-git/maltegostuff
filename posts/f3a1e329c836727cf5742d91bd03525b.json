{"subject": "Dinah In Heaven", "text": "She did not know that she was dead,\nBut, when the pang was o'er,\nSat down to wait her Master's tread\nUpon the Golden Floor,\n\nWith ears full-cock and anxious eye\nImpatiently resigned;\nBut ignorant that Paradise\nDid not admit her kind.\n\nPersons with Haloes, Harps, and Wings\nAssembled and reproved;\nOr talked to her of Heavenly things,\nBut Dinah never moved.\n\nThere was one step along the Stair\nThat led to Heaven's Gate;\nAnd, till she heard it, her affair\nWas--she explained--to wait.\n\nAnd she explained with flattened ear,\nBared lip and milky tooth--\nStorming against Ithuriel's Spear\nThat only proved her truth!\n\nSudden--far down the Bridge of Ghosts\nThat anxious spirits clomb--\nShe caught that step in all the hosts,\nAnd knew that he had come.\n\nShe left them wondering what to do,\nBut not a doubt had she.\nSwifter than her own squeal she flew\nAcross the Glassy Sea;\n\nFlushing the Cherubs every where,\nAnd skidding as she ran,\nShe refuged under Peter's Chair\nAnd waited for her man.\n\n. . . . . . . \n\nThere spoke a Spirit out of the press,\n'Said:--\"Have you any here\nThat saved a fool from drunkenness,\nAnd a coward from his fear?\n\n\"That turned a soul from dark to day \nWhen other help was vain;\nThat snatched it from Wanhope and made\nA cur a man again?\"\n\n\"Enter and look,\" said Peter then,\nAnd set The Gate ajar.\n\"If know aught of women and men\nI trow she is not far.\"\n\n\"Neither by virtue, speech nor art\nNor hope of grace to win;\nBut godless innocence of heart\nThat never heard of sin:\n\n\"Neither by beauty nor belief\nNor white example shown.\nSomething a wanton--more a thief--\nBut--most of all--mine own.\"\n\n\"Enter and look,\" said Peter then,\n\"And send you well to speed;\nBut, for all that I know of women and men\nYour riddle is hard to read.\"\n\nThen flew Dinah from under the Chair,\nInto his arms she flew--\nAnd licked his face from chin to hair\nAnd Peter passed them through!"}
