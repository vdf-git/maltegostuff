{"subject": "In Petersburg We'Ll Meet Again", "text": "In Petersburg we'll meet again,\nAs though we'd buried the sun there,\nAnd for the first time utter\nThe blessed, senseless word.\nIn the black velvet of Soviet night,\nIn the velvet of worldwide emptiness,\nThe kind eyes of touched women still sing,\nThe immortal flowers still bloom.\n\n2\n\nThe capitol arches like a wildcat,\nA patrol is standing on the bridge,\nA single angry motor speeds by in the dark,\nAnd cries out like a cuckoo.\nI do not need a pass for the evening,\nI am not afraid of the sentries:\nI will pray in the Soviet night\nFor the blessed and senseless word.\n\n3\n\nI hear the theater's light rustling\nAnd a young girl's 'Oh' --\nIn Kypris'arms, a huge bunch\nOf immortal roses.\nOut of boredom, we warm ourselves\nBy a bonfire. Perhaps centuries will pass,\nAnd the kind hands of touched women\nWill gather up the light ashes.\n\n4\n\nSomewhere the red rows of the gallery,\nThe sumptuous chiffon of the boxes;\nThe clockwork-puppet of the officer;\nNot for black souls or vile hypocrites . . .\nRight. Put out, please, our candles\nIn the black velvet of worldwide emptiness,\nThe sloped shoulders of blessed women still sing,\nBut you won't notice the night sun."}
