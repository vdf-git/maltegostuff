{"subject": "Sunbeam", "text": "I pray to the sunbeam from the window - \nIt is pale, thin, straight. \nSince morning I have been silent, \nAnd my heart - is split. \nThe copper on my washstand \nHas turned green, \nBut the sunbeam plays on it \nSo charmingly. \nHow innocent it is, and simple, \nIn the evening calm, \nBut to me in this deserted temple \nIt's like a golden celebration, \nAnd a consolation."}
