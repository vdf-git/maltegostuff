{"subject": "Evening Star", "text": "'Twas noontide of summer,\n                And mid-time of night;\n              And stars, in their orbits,\n                Shone pale, thro' the light\n              Of the brighter, cold moon,\n                'Mid planets her slaves,\n              Herself in the Heavens,\n                Her beam on the waves.\n                  I gazed awhile\n                  On her cold smile;\n              Too cold- too cold for me-\n                There pass'd, as a shroud,\n                A fleecy cloud,\n              And I turned away to thee,\n                Proud Evening Star,\n                In thy glory afar,\n              And dearer thy beam shall be;\n                For joy to my heart\n                Is the proud part\n              Thou bearest in Heaven at night,\n                And more I admire\n                Thy distant fire,\n              Than that colder, lowly light."}
