Hovering/\nlike the obsessive hawks.\n\nThe migratory, adjutant/ \nstorks, had not come to roost \non the tall tree\u2015 \nnaked as they are.\n\nDemocracy always/sends \nerotica/to take off your mind \nfrom the trivial subjects.\n\nFireworks resume the celebrations \nfor the fugitive/who returned \nhome after drinking absinthe."}
