{"subject": "Harvard's Dead", "text": "They fought on many a crimsoned field,\nThey sleep in many a glen;\nThey marched to glory and to death,\nAnd came not home again;\nBut Harvard claims them for her roll,\nHer roll of Harvard men.\n\nSome in the sunny days of youth;\nAnd some in ripening age,\nWent forth with valiant hearts and hopes,\nTo breast the conflict's rage;\nAnd history every name records\nOn her immortal page.\n\nWeep at the shrines where once they knelt;\nWeep where the heroes sleep;\nWeep, when the funeral pomp proceeds,\nAs vacant firesides weep;\nWhen did thy sickle, mighty Death,\nSo precious harvest reap?\n\nAnd sing a paean o'er the dead,\nA requiem for the brave;\nSing hymns of cheerful melody\nAbove each soldier's grave;\nIn solemn joy, with festal folds,\nLet the old banner wave!\n\nFreedom on every bloody field\nHas some new triumphs won;\nHer honored wreaths are on the brow\nOf every favorite son;\nAnd time is reckoned, not by years,\nBut deeds of valor done.\n\nWhile fame inscribes ten thousand names,\nAlong her pillared nave,\nOf patriot sons and sires who sleep\nIn glory's star-gemmed graves,\nOf all the host fair Harvard claims\nThe bravest of the brave.\nMarch 17, 1863"}
