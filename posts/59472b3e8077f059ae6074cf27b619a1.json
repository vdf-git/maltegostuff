{"subject": "Henry Tripp", "text": "The bank broke and I lost my savings.\nI was sick of the tiresome game in Spoon River\nAnd I made up my mind to run away\nAnd leave my place in life and my family;\nBut just as the midnight train pulled in,\nQuick off the steps jumped Cully Green\nAnd Martin Vise, and began to fight\nTo settle their ancient rivalry,\nStriking each other with fists that sounded\nLike the blows of knotted clubs.\nNow it seemed to me that Cully was winning,\nWhen his bloody face broke into a grin\nOf sickly cowardice, leaning on Martin\nAnd whining out \"We're good friends, Mart,\nYou know that I'm your friend.\"\nBut a terrible punch from Martin knocked him\nAround and around and into a heap.\nAnd then they arrested me as a witness,\nAnd I lost my train and staid in Spoon River\nTo wage my battle of life to the end.\nOh, Cully Green, you were my savior --\nYou, so ashamed and drooped for years,\nLoitering listless about the streets,\nAnd tying rags 'round your festering soul,\nWho failed to fight it out."}
