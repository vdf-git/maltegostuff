{"subject": "You and Your Ilk", "text": "I have thought much upon\nwho might be my ilk,\nand that I am ilk myself if I have ilk.\nIs one of my ilk, or me, the barber\nwho cuts the hair of the blind?\nAnd the man crushed by cruelties\nfor which we can't imagine sorrow,\nwho would be his ilk?\nAnd whose ilk was it\nstanding around, hands in pockets, May 1933,\nwhen 2,242 tons of books were burned?\nNot mine. So: what makes my ilkness my\nilkness? No answers, none forthcoming.\nTo be one of the ilks, that's all\nI hoped for; to say hello to the mailman,\nnod to my neighbors, to watch\nmy children climb the stairs of a big yellow bus\nwhich takes them to a place\nwhere they learn to read\nand write and eat their lunches\nfrom puzzle trays\u2014all around them, amid\nthe clatter and din,\namid bananas, bread, and milk.\nall around them: them and their ilk."}
