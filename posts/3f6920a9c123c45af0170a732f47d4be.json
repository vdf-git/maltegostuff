I know about you.\n\nDo not fool me with afflictions\nwith names nobody dares to mention.\nDon't put me to bed among dribbling\nchildren who know not what they say, of age.\nDo not shake money out of my pocket\nfor pointless hours in classy clinics.\n\nWipe your feet and make yourself at home.\n\nTranslated by John van Tiel"}
