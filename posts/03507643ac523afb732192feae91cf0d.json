{"subject": "Song The Twelfth", "text": "\u201cOur rhythmic armies, lifted whole,\nHeaved, whelm and awe;\nTrue to harmonious law,\nPeace, thy consummate works spring from the plastic soul.\u201d\nSo mused the Sage. Seaward he stood: \u201cHow swell\nYon waters measured to the moon's weird spell!\u201d\nHe saw the stars: \u201cYea, order, thrift divine,\nBy thee yon congruous worlds unwasted wheel and shine.\u201d\n\nBold Ben he strikes his spurs into the sea.\nBeauty and they\nBending our bay,\nWater and light one living crystal be.\nCurve me that darling lip: dimpling it swells\nTo kiss yon lip of shells.\n\nThe splendour is setting, the gray coming on;\nBut the bird of the woodland dew-sweetens his tone.\nO Sun of my youth, in the flame of thy power\nThe river ran glory, the meadow caught flower:\nThat Sun in the west; be the harmony true,\nAnd steal on Regret in the sweetness of dew.\n\nThey come, they go; they round the plan\nOf bread with beauty and with types to man,\u2014\nThe Seasons. Praise, through all our days,\nOur weary days of toil and strife,\nFor bowing Heavens, and sweet relays\nOf blessing to the Gates of Life!"}
