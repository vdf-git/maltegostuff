{"subject": "Proem", "text": "Long  left unwounded by the grisly foe,\nWho sometime pierces all with fatal shaft,\nStill on my cheek fresh youth did lively glow,\nAnd at his threatening arrow gaily laught;\nCame then my friendly scholar, and we quaffed\nFrom learning's spring, its sparkling overflow;\nAll through the lingering evening's charm\u00e8d hours,\nDelightful fellowship in thought was ours:\nIf I from Poesy could not all abstain,\nHe my poor verses oft did quite undress,\nNew wrapt in words my thought's veiled nakedness,\nOr kindly clipt my steed's luxuriant mane:\n'Twas my delight his searching eye to meet,\nIn days of genial versing, memories sweet."}
