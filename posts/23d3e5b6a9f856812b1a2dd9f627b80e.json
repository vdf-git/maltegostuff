{"subject": "Subway Wind", "text": "Far down, down through the city's great, gaunt gut, \nThe gray train rushing bears the weary wind; \nIn the packed cars the fans the crowd's breath cut, \nLeaving the sick and heavy air behind. \nAnd pale-cheeked children seek the upper door \nTo give their summer jackets to the breeze; \nTheir laugh is swallowed in the deafening roar \nOf captive wind that moans for fields and seas; \nSeas cooling warm where native schooners drift \nThrough sleepy waters, while gulls wheel and sweep, \nWaiting for windy waves the keels to lift \nLightly among the islands of the deep; \nIslands of lofty palm trees blooming white \nThat lend their perfume to the tropic sea, \nWhere fields lie idle in the dew drenched night, \nAnd the Trades float above them fresh and free."}
