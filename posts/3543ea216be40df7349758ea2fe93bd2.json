{"subject": "The Lonely Road", "text": "We used to fear the lonely road\nThat twisted round the hill;\nIt dipped down to the river-way,\nAnd passed the haunted mill,\nAnd then crept on, until it reached\nThe churchyard, green and still.\n\nNo pipers ever took that road,\nNo gipsies, brown and gay;\nNo shepherds with their gentle flocks,\nNo loads of scented hay;\nNo market-waggons jingled by\nOn any Saturday.\n\nThe dog-wood there flung wide its stars,\nIn April, silvery sweet;\nThe squirrels crossed that path all day\nOn tiny flying feet;\nThe wild, brown rabbits knew each turn,\nEach shadowy safe retreat.\n\nAnd there the golden-belted bee\nSang his sweet summer song,\nThe crickets chirped there to the moon\nWith steady note and strong;\nTill cold and silence wrapped them round\nWhen autumn nights grew long.\n\nBut, oh! they brought the lonely dead\nAlong that quiet way,\nWith strange procession, dark and slow,\nOn sunny days and grey;\nWe used to watch them, wonder-eyed,\nNor care again to play.\n\nAnd we forgot each merry jest;\nThe birds on bush and tree\nSilenced the song within their throats\nAnd with us watched to see,\nThe soft, slow passing out of sight\nOf that dark mystery.\nWe fear no more the lonely road\nThat winds around the hill;\nFar from the busy world's highway\nAnd the gods' slow-grinding mill;\nIt only seems a peaceful path,\nPleasant, and green, and still."}
