{"subject": "The Moral Of History", "text": "ALL is one issue, every skirmish tells, \nAnd war is but the picture in the story; \nThe plot's below: from time to time upwells \nA scene of blood and glory, \nThat makes us understand the allegory,\u2014 \nA lurid flash of verse,\u2014and at its close \nRecurring, undiscipherable prose."}
