{"subject": "September", "text": "Matron fair, ripe, rich and glowing,\nFull thy stores, thy vintage flowing;\nGolden sunflowers, dahlias blowing,\nDeck thy festal board.\nWith ruddy fruit the boughs are bending,\nHeaven and earth in blessing blending;\nNature sings, her song ascending\nTo her bounteous Lord.\nFlora weeps her waning flowers,\nWhile Pomona lavish showers\nHer wealth: the field and garden dowers\nWith fruitage fresh and fair.\nRichly crowned with golden sheaves,\nEre October tints the leaves,\nThy full hand each want relieves\nOf penury and care.\nScotia's vine-the bramble twining-\nCopse-wood bank, and hedge-row lining,\nSee the jetty clusters shining,\nChildren, come and gather!\nRicher fruits and fairer flowers\nGem the southern fields and bowers;\nDearer to this heart of ours,\nBramble, fern, and heather.\nHark! oh hark these dropping shots,\nThe heath is foul with crimson clots,\nThe sportsman o'er his victim gloats,\nAnd coolly calls it sport.\nAlas! ye sinless, hapless things,\nYour blood-stained breasts and broken wings,\nMy heart with deepest pity wrings,\nSlain in each wild resort.\nSoftly radiant, deeply blue,\nFlecked with clouds of snowy hue,\nSoft enchantment gilds the view\nWhile I skyward gaze.\nBark of light that sail'st at even\nThrough the azure depths of heaven,\nDear the boon to Autumn given,\nThy nightly full-orb'd rays.\nThe woods are still, the warbler's throat\nPours no more the wooing note,\nThe lark, on mounting wing afloat,\nHath ceased his matin lays:\nA softly sweet ethereal calm\nSheds around its soothing balm;\nMy heart indites a silent psalm\nOf joyous, grateful praise."}
