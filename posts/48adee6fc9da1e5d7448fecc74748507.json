{"subject": "The Mean Husband", "text": "Thin cloth of dolichos supplies the shoes,\nIn which some have to brave the frost and cold.\nA bride, when poor, her tender hands must use,\nHer dress to make, and the sharp needle hold.\nThis man is wealthy, yet he makes his bride\nCollars and waistbands for his robes provide.\n\nConscious of wealth, he moves with easy mien;\nPolitely on the left he takes his place;\nThe ivory pin is at his girdle seen:--\nHis dress and gait show gentlemanly grace.\nWhy do we brand him in our satire here?\n'Tis this---his niggard soul provokes the sneer."}
