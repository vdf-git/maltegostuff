{"subject": "On Journey", "text": "I'd like to be off to France,\nBut France is so frightfully far,\nAt the least though, I'll pick out a brand new suit,\nAnd mount on a trip carefree.\nWhen the train starts up the overpass,\nI'll lean on the azure window\nAnd think happy thoughts alone,\nThis May day at dawn,\nLeaving it all to the new-grass-sprouting heart."}
