{"subject": "The Old-Timer", "text": "He showed up in the springtime, when the geese began to honk;\nHe signed up with the outfit, and we fattened up his bronk;\nHis chaps were old and tattered, but he never seemed to mind,\n\u2018Cause for worryin\u2019 and frettin\u2019 he had never been designed;\nHe\u2019s the type of cattle-puncher that has vanished now, of course,\nWith his hundred-dollar saddle on his twenty-dollar horse.\n\nHe never seemed to bother over fortune\u2019s ups and downs,\nAnd he never quit his singin\u2019 when the gang was full of frowns;\nHe would lose his roundup money in an hour of swift play,\nBut he never seemed discouraged when he ambled on his way.\nHe would hit the trail a-singin\u2019, and his smile was out full force,\nThough he\u2019d lost his fancy saddle and he didn\u2019t have a horse.\n\nI have wondered where he wanders in these late, degenerate years,\nWhen there are no boundless ranges, and there are no long-horn steers;\nBut I\u2019ll warrant he is cheerful, though unfriendly is the trail,\nAnd his cigarette is flowing, though his grub supply may fail,\nFor he had life\u2019s happy secret \u2014 he had traced it to the source\nIn his hundred-dollar saddle on his twenty-dollar horse."}
