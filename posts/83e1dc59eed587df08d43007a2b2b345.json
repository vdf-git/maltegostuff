{"subject": "Spaniels In A Field Of Kale", "text": "The two spaniels leaping and flying \nlike shadow and leaper, like leaper and shadow \nsent in wider and wider circles, \nthe more they leap about, and chase  \neach other through the mile-wide depths of choppy kale, \nthe more they might be mistaken for \nan upblown leaf, a lifted edge that balances \nits catchment of light briefly like their coats \nparting to the skin in the wind=s combs  \nwhich cross the heath like a search-party, extending \nthe eerie coastline of the prison fence. \nThe logic of them, flopping and collapsing, flies \nout in a northerly direction towards the last outcrops \nof Scapa Flow, or keeps going with the rafts \nof overushing altocumulus due west \nto the land floes of Inishbofin, east to Orford Ness \nor south to the lip of the Lizard, where it hovers panting \nover the odd ellipsis of Land's End; \nthis before it takes the whole flight on rewind, \ntracing it phase by phase until the dogs \nrefind the channel they have trodden flat \nin the blowing field where the kale  \nsprings up again in front of them, untrampled. \nThe logic of their leaping takes  \nthe flight again, and then again, as if each flight \nis the exercise without which its belly \nwould drag too close to the ground, \nand those tresses in earthbound flight become \na slip-leash, a sort of flowing yoke built around \nthe features of a little prune face  \nand mouthful of yappy snarls."}
