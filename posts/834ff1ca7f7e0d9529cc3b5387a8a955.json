{"subject": "Dog Bite", "text": "The worst for him was his friend turned wolf,\nand the blood that splattered as he ran. The worst\nfor us: the hospital, his upper lip tugged back\nto show the gash\u2014the flesh halved deeply,\ncleanly\u2014while I hold him for the needle\nthat rubs pain out. He submits\nto the quick stitch, the thread black\nagainst pink skin, calm now he sees\nthe doctor can be trusted, his voice\nsoothing, his face clean shaven,\nthe clues that signal kindness to a child.\nHe's worried, though, about his pet\nwho didn't mean it, Mom. His voice is flat.\nHe knows the months he's tried to woo this dog\nwere over when it leapt for his throat\nand caught his mouth. The scars, at least,\nwill be invisible. At home, he'll sleep,\nbig boy between his parents, till he's sure\nno beast will tear into his dreams. And we\nwill want him there, our bodies makeshift walls.\nWe who led the stranger to our home,\nfixed him a bowl, taught him to sleep\nunder our blankets, we who taught our son\nto rub the muzzle that sheathes the teeth."}
