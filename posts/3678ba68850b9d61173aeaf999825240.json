{"subject": "FAIRY TALE", "text": "There once was a banker\nWho for all the wrong reasons\nHad become a banker.\nHe consulted, in his hunger\nFor melancholy vindication,\nAn apple tree, a vascular surgeon and a box.\nAll three equally melancholy,\nYet so satisfied inside\nThat the banker felt wronged.\n\nThirty-seven butterflies\nAnd thirty-seven bottles of wine\nAnd thirty-seven folded blankets\nAnd thirty-seven bus tickets\nAnd thirty-seven bars of gold\nAnd thirty-seven fires\nAnd thirty-seven belches later\nHe lay down in his hammock\nFor thirty-seven reasons."}
