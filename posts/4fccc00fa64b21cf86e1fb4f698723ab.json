{"subject": "King Harald's Trance", "text": "I\n\nSword in length a reaping-hook amain\nHarald sheared his field, blood up to shank:\n'Mid the swathes of slain,\nFirst at moonrise drank.\n\nII\n\nThereof hunger, as for meats the knife,\nPricked his ribs, in one sharp spur to reach\nHome and his young wife,\nNigh the sea-ford beach.\n\nIII\n\nAfter battle keen to feed was he:\nSmoking flesh the thresher washed down fast,\nLike an angry sea\nShips from keel to mast.\n\nIV\n\nName us glory, singer, name us pride\nMatching Harald's in his deeds of strength;\nChiefs, wife, sword by side,\nFoemen stretched their length!\n\nV\n\nHalf a winter night the toasts hurrahed,\nCrowned him, clothed him, trumpeted him high,\nTill awink he bade\nWife to chamber fly.\n\nVI\n\nTwice the sun had mounted, twice had sunk,\nEre his ears took sound; he lay for dead;\nMountain on his trunk,\nOcean on his head.\n\nVII\n\nClamped to couch, his fiery hearing sucked\nWhispers that at heart made iron-clang:\nHere fool-women clucked,\nThere men held harangue.\n\nVIII\n\nBurial to fit their lord of war\nThey decreed him: hailed the kingling: ha!\nHateful! but this Thor\nFailed a weak lamb's baa.\n\nIX\n\nKing they hailed a branchlet, shaped to fare,\nWeighted so, like quaking shingle spume,\nWhen his blood's own heir\nRipened in the womb!\n\nX\n\nStill he heard, and doglike, hoglike, ran\nNose of hearing till his blind sight saw:\nWoman stood with man\nMouthing low, at paw.\n\nXI\n\nWoman, man, they mouthed; they spake a thing\nArmed to split a mountain, sunder seas:\nStill the frozen king\nLay and felt him freeze.\n\nXII\n\nDoglike, hoglike, horselike now he raced,\nRiderless, in ghost across a ground\nFlint of breast, blank-faced,\nPast the fleshly bound.\n\nXIII\n\nSmell of brine his nostrils filled with might:\nNostrils quickened eyelids, eyelids hand:\nHand for sword at right\nGroped, the great haft spanned.\n\nXIV\n\nWonder struck to ice his people's eyes:\nHim they saw, the prone upon the bier,\nSheer from backbone rise,\nSword uplifting peer.\n\nXV\n\nSitting did he breathe against the blade,\nStanding kiss it for that proof of life:\nStrode, as netters wade,\nStraightway to his wife.\n\nXVI\n\nHer he eyed: his judgement was one word,\nFoulbed! and she fell: the blow clove two.\nFearful for the third,\nAll their breath indrew.\n\nXVII\n\nMorning danced along the waves to beach;\nDumb his chiefs fetched breath for what might hap:\nGlassily on each\nStared the iron cap.\n\nXVIII\n\nSudden, as it were a monster oak\nSplit to yield a limb by stress of heat,\nStrained he, staggered, broke\nDoubled at their feet."}
