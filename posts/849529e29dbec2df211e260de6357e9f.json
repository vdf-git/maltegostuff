{"subject": "Arrival", "text": "Between she and he\n               and sexuality swoops a gender\n                      patenting a word, as it is, \nat the birth\u2019s door pretending to\nbe a kiss of radical thought.\n               Mediocrity always has an intentionality\n                       with colored plumage, a passionate\ndance before the final plunge of\na true love. Black or white, somebody\n               is etching a dangerous scar on the skin\n                        of a maimed girl. Myalgia of a \nnation like a lipless epic on the\nwhile book which cannot be completed.\n               I wanted to believe in never tomorrow."}
