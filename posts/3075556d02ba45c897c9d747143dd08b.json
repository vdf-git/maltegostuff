{"subject": "Dream", "text": "A dream is but a world we can turn too when we have nothing left\nA house is a home to step in to get out of the cold\nA battlefield is a pool of bloodshed buried with souls\nTo be stuck in a dream forever is eternal bliss\nNo pain no stress, only fear and happiness\n\nA planet is but a world we live on\nAn ocean is endless, its the mother of life\nA sun is warm, its blanket covers the land and cast shadows upon it\nTo roam a frontier, forever going lushious and free\nAll war would cease, leaving world peace\n\nMy painted world closes in\nThe Light shines\nThe Dark shades\nThey both surround me\nmy life is at stake\nI turn to run its already to late\nGasping for air I awake"}
