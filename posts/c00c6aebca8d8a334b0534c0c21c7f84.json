{"subject": "Summer Midnight", "text": "Athwart the star-lit midnight sky \nLuminous fleecy clouds drift by, \nAs the mysterious, pallid moon \nSinks in the waveless still lagoon. \nNow that the queen of night is dead, \nThe starry commonwealth o'erhead \n(Softer and fairer than gaudy day) \nSheds lustrous light from the Milky Way; \nWhile the Dog-star gleams, and the Sisters Seven, \nFloat tremulously in the misty heaven. \nFaintly, afar the horse-bells ring; \nMyriads of wakened crickets sing; \nAnd the spirit voices of the night \nSing snatches of fairy music bright, \nOld-world melodies - lang syne sung - \nRecalling days when the heart was young, \nWhose wonderful cadences fall and rise, \nAs the wind in the casuarina sighs; \nAnd the world seems 'gulfed, this summer night, \nIn a flood of delicious, dreamy light."}
