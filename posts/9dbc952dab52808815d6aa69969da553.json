{"subject": "Blackwater", "text": "A self-protecting game was going on.\nAfter the paternity test\nthere was slow burning\ninside the moon.\nEarth heaved a big sigh.\nBlackwater was making a muddy sound.\n\nEmbroidery was fading \naftermoon.\nI open the window to uncover \nthe chill. A young lass has jumped over\nfrom a flyover to meet a concrete end.\n\nThe liberated soul of nation \nindulges in cocktails of free erotica.\nIn beginning there was a sacred river; \nnow in bed, dry bones\nwere found soaked in release."}
