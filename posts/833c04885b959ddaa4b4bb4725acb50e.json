{"subject": "The Morning Half-Life Blues", "text": "Girls buck the wind in the grooves toward work\nin fuzzy coats promised to be warm as fur.\nThe shop windows snicker\nflashing them hurrying over dresses they cannot afford:\nyou are not pretty enough, not pretty enough.\n\nBlown with yesterday\u2019s papers through the boiled coffee morning\nwe dream of the stop on the subway without a name,\nthe door in the heart of the grove of skyscrapers,\nthat garden where we nestle to the teats of a furry world,\nlie in mounds of peony eating grapes,\nand need barter ourselves for nothing.\nnot by the hour, not by the pound, not by the skinful,\nthat party to which no one will give or sell us the key\nthough we have all thought briefly we found it\ndrunk or in bed.\n\nBlack girls with thin legs and high necks stalking like herons,\nplump girls with blue legs and green eyelids and\nstrawberry breasts,\nswept off to be frozen in fluorescent cubes,\nthe vacuum of your jobs sucks your brains dry\nand fills you with the ooze of melted comics.\nLiving is later. This is your rented death.\nYou grasp at hard commodities and vague lusts\nto make up, to pay for each day\nwhich opens like a can and is empty, and then another,\nafternoons like dinosaur eggs stuffed with glue.\n\nGirls of the dirty morning, ticketed and spent,\nyou will be less at forty than at twenty.\nYour living is a waste product of somebody\u2019s mill.\nI would fix you like buds to a city where people work\nto make and do things necessary and good,\nwhere work is real as bread and babies and trees in parks\nwhere we would all blossom slowly and ripen to sound fruit.\nAnonymous submission."}
