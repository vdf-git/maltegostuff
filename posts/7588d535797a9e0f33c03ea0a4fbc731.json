{"subject": "The Cane-Bottom'D Chair", "text": "In tattered old slippers that toast at the bars, \nAnd a ragged old jacket perfumed with cigars, \nAway from the world, and its toils and its cares, \nI've a snug little kingdom up four pair of stairs. \n\nTo mount to this realm is a toil, to be sure, \nBut the fire there is bright and the air rather pure; \nAnd the view I behold on a sunshiny day \nIs grand through the chimney-pots over the way. \n\nThis snug little chamber is cramm'd in all nooks \nWith worthless old knicknacks and silly old books, \nAnd foolish old odds and foolish old ends, \nCrack'd bargains from brokers, cheap keepsakes from friends. \n\nOld armor, prints, pictures, pipes, china (all crack'd), \nOld rickety tables, and chairs broken-backed; \nA two-penny treasury, wondrous to see; \nWhat matter? 'tis pleasant to you, friend, and me. \n\nNo better divan need the Sultan require, \nThan the creaking old sofa that basks by the fire; \nAnd 'tis wonderful, surely, what music you get \nFrom the rickety, ramshackle, wheezy spinet. \n\nThat praying-rug came from a Turcoman's camp; \nBy Tiber once twinkled that brazen old lamp; \nA Mameluke fierce yonder dagger has drawn: \n'Tis a murderous knife to toast muffins upon. \n\nLong, long through the hours, and the night, and the chimes, \nHere we talk of old books, and old friends, and old times; \nAs we sit in a fog made of rich Latakie, \nThis chamber is pleasant to you, friend, and me. \n\nBut of all the cheap treasures that garnish my nest, \nThere is one that I love and I cherish the best: \nFor the finest of couches that's padded with hair \nI never would change thee, my cane-bottom'd chair. \n\n'Tis a bandy-legg'd, high shoulder'd, worm-eaten seat, \nWith a creaking old back, and twisted old feet; \nBut since the fair morning when Fanny sat there, \nI bless thee and love thee, old cane-bottom'd chair. \n\nIf chairs have but feeling, in holding such charms, \nA thrill must have pass'd through your wither'd old arms! \nI look'd, and I long'd, and I wish'd in despair; \nI wished myself turn'd to a cane-bottom'd chair. \n\nIt was but a moment she sat in this place, \nShe'd a scarf on her neck, and a smile on her face; \nA smile on her face, and a rose in her hair, \nAnd she sat there and bloom'd in my cane-bottom'd chair. \n\nAnd so I have valued my chair ever since, \nLike the shrine of a saint, or the throne of a prince; \nSaint Fanny, my patroness sweet I declare, \nThe queen of my heart and my cane-bottom'd chair. \n\nWhen the candles burn low, and the company's gone, \nIn the silence of night as I sit here alone -- \nI sit here alone, but we yet are a pair -- \nMy Fanny I see in my cane-bottom'd chair. \n\nShe comes from the past and revisits my room; \nShe looks as she then did, all beauty and bloom; \nSo smiling and tender, so fresh and so fair, \nAnd yonder she sits in my cane-bottom'd chair."}
