And that melting pot of names\nand blood that is the monster.\nSon of the white bull with bewitched\ntongue. Evasive vocabulary.\nOf words with no sex.\nImagine, I tell myself, the immense\ncharade when he hits.\n\nAgain: the thread doesn't taut.\nAgain: isn't it strange?\nWhere are you now, which silly\nhand has suspended your name?\nIf you were dead\u2026\nbeyond\u2026 If you were dead\nwould I still make sense?\nLeaned against this entrance.\nThe hand raised, funny,\nin my heart.\n\nTranslated by Tania Calcinaro"}
