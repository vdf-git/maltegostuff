{"subject": "A Breast Grows In My Head", "text": "A breast grows in my head\nMy brain has a nipple\nThe milk sways back and forth\nmaking the lobes slosh\nfrom bow to stern\nI'm seasick.\nNow tension shoves the breast\npast my mouth and nose up past my eyes\nto the very top of\nof my sweetbreads\nthere it stays like jello, the nipple\nlike a berry filled with brandy\nunder hazelnut chocolate. If you\nsuck through the hole in my skull,\nthoughts squirt out."}
