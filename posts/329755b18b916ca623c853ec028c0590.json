{"subject": "The Sounds In The Evening", "text": "The sounds in the evening          \n\nGo all through the house,          \n\nThe click of the clock              \n\nAnd the pick of the mouse,        \n\nThe footsteps of people            \n\nUpon the top floor,                  \n\nThe skirts of my mother            \n\nThat brush by the door,            \n\nThe crick in the boards,            \n\nAnd the creek of the chairs,      \n\nThe fluttering murmurs            \n\nOutside on the stairs,                \n\nThe ring of the bell,                  \n\nThe arrival of guests,                \n\nThe laugh of my father              \n\nAt one of his jests,                    \n\nThe clashing of dishes                \n\nAs dinner goes in,                      \n\nThe babble of voices                \n\nThat distance makes thin,          \n\nThe mewing of cats                    \n\nThat seem just by my ear,          \n\nThe hooting of owls                    \n\nThat can never seem near,          \n\nThe queer little noises              \n\nThat no one explains\u2026                \n\nTill the moon through the slats    \n\nOf my window-blind rains,          \n\nAnd the world of my eyes            \n\nAnd my ears melts like steam      \n\nAs I find my pillow                    \n\nThe world of my dream."}
