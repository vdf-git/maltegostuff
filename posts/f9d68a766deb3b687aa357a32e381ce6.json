{"subject": "Bill The Dreamer", "text": "'Some day when I'm rich (said Bill) I'm going to leave the sea,\nSail an' steam alike 'll see the livin' last o' me;\nAnd 'bout ship or heave her to, they'll rouse me out no more,\nIn a quiet cottage like I've often seen ashore,\nWith hen and chickens, daisies growin' by the door.'\n\n'Quiet will the days come and easy will go,\nSmoking of my pipe there and workin' with a hoe,\nAnd thinkin' of poor mates o' mine toiling in the cold\nThat hadn't sense to leave it an' they growing old.'\n\n'For when all's said and done, lads, it's little short o' sin\nTo spend your money foolish that's bitter hard to win;\nI'll save my pay a year or two, and then I'll sail no more,\nSitting down so easy in my little place ashore.'\n\nAnd so went his yarn on and so would he say -\nRound the Horn with hurricanes blowing all the way,\nAll the way from Callao trudging home again\nTo the Bar light shining in the cold and rain.\n\nBut who's to keep from share and share with friends o' the best?\nAnd girls along the waterfront, they'll help to spend the rest;\nAnd the cottage and the garden and the daisies by the door,\nThey went the way of many dreams when sailors come to shore.\n\nAnd he's rolling down to Rio with a drunken Dago crew,\nAnd the deadheads under hatches till they get their groaning through;\nYes, he's rolling down to Rio as he's often done before,\nAnd will do till the day comes for Bill to sail no more,\nWhen the ninth wave, the last wave, shall bring him to shore!"}
