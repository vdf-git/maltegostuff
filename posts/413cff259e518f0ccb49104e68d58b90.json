{"subject": "Milton", "text": "I pace the sounding sea-beach and behold \n    How the voluminous billows roll and run, \n    Upheaving and subsiding, while the sun \n    Shines through their sheeted emerald far unrolled, \n  And the ninth wave, slow gathering fold by fold \n    All its loose-flowing garments into one, \n    Plunges upon the shore, and floods the dun \n    Pale reach of sands, and changes them to gold. \n  So in majestic cadence rise and fall \n    The mighty undulations of thy song, \n    O sightless bard, England's M\u00e6onides! \n  And ever and anon, high over all \n    Uplifted, a ninth wave superb and strong, \n    Floods all the soul with its melodious seas."}
