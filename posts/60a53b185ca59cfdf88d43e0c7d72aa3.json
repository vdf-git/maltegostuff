{"subject": "The Drone", "text": "I might have been a worker, but I'm nothing but a drone.\nI tell my idle stories in a philosophic tone.\nIn a fuzzy, spiny mantle of remoteness softly furled\nI lie and watch with half-shut eyes the stupefying world.\n\nAnd they bustle and they rustle with their self-consuming din.\nAnd eager feet go hurrying out and tired feet come in.\nLike Bottom, when they hear a sound they all must rush to see.\nThey're always running after life. I let it come to me."}
