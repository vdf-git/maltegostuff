{"subject": "The Merry Bard", "text": "ZULEIKAH! The young Agas in the bazaar are slim-wasted and wear\nyellow slippers. I am old and hideous. One of my eyes is out, and\nthe hairs of my beard are mostly gray. Praise be to Allah! I am a\nmerry bard.\n\nThere is a bird upon the terrace of the Emir's chief wife. Praise\nbe to Allah! He has emeralds on his neck, and a ruby tail. I am a\nmerry bard. He deafens me with his diabolical screaming.\n\nThere is a little brown bird in the basket-maker's cage. Praise be\nto Allah! He ravishes my soul in the moonlight. I am a merry bard.\n\nThe peacock is an Aga, but the little bird is a Bulbul.\n\nI am a little brown Bulbul. Come and listen in the moonlight.\nPraise be to Allah! I am a merry bard."}
