{"subject": "The Morning Post", "text": "Sand has flown from the Sahara in the night,\ncrossing lands and seas to fall on this city.\nOr has some wind blown it from nearby fields? \nFor the first time I take notice of dust:\nall my life I have lived without seeing\nall that is ordinary, all that is\nwhere it should be:\nbirds in the sky, men on land,\nfish in the sea's dark depths.\n\nWearing a mask\nmade specially for this poem,\nI stand with eyes open on an empty stage,\ndeclaiming inside a glass box\nmy name, nickname, surname, pen-name,\naddress, age, birthplace, education, job.\nEvery day since I opened my eyes\nI have done this, trembling like a broken puppet\ndangling from the strings\nthat grow twisted as I wither too,\ngasping for breath,\nmy next role unwritten. \nThe post lies on the mat,\ncurling at the edges, unread\nevery morning.\nFrom there I move on\nanother passing day: hardly a glance\nat the morning post my figure shadows.\n\nThe geography of near and far inside you\ndecides what life brings: happiness or sorrow; \ntime of grief, a brief moment for love.\nOver and over I practise the minor rules \nof punctuation: life still spent \non small distinctions. Yesterday's\nunfinished business still unfinished\ntomorrow. I grow old, trying to become new\nby wearing another coat today.\n\n\nThe literal translation of this poem was made by Lucy Rosenstein\nThe final translated version of the poem is by Bernard O'Donoghue"}
