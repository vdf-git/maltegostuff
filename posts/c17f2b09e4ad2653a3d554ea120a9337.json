{"subject": "Autumn: To My Mother", "text": "How memory cuts away the years,\t\nAnd how clean the picture comes\t\nOf autumn days, brisk and busy;\t\nCharged with keen sunshine.\t\nAnd you, stirred with activity,\t5\nThe spirit of those energetic days.\t\n\nThere was our back-yard,\t\nSo plain and stripped of green,\t\nWith even the weeds carefully pulled away\t\nFrom the crooked red bricks that made the walk,\t\nAnd the earth on either side so black.\t\n\nAutumn and dead leaves burning in the sharp air.\t\nAnd winter comforts coming in like a pageant.\t\nI shall not forget them:\u2014\t\nGreat jars laden with the raw green of pickles,\t\nStanding in a solemn row across the back of the porch,\t\nExhaling the pungent dill;\t\nAnd in the very centre of the yard,\t\nYou, tending the great catsup kettle of gleaming copper,\t\nWhere fat, red tomatoes bobbed up and down\t\nLike jolly monks in a drunken dance.\t\nAnd there were bland banks of cabbages that came by the wagon-load,\t\nSoon to be cut into delicate ribbons\t\nOnly to be crushed by the heavy, wooden stompers.\t\nSuch feathery whiteness\u2014to come to kraut!\t\nAnd after, there were grapes that hid their brightness under a grey dust,\t\nThen gushed thrilling, purple blood over the fire;\t\nAnd enamelled crab-apples that tricked with their fragrance\t\nBut were bitter to taste.\t\nAnd there were spicy plums and ill-shaped quinces,\t\nAnd long string beans floating in pans of clear water\t\nLike slim, green fishes.\t\nAnd there was fish itself,\t\nSalted, silver herring from the city\u2026.\t\n\nAnd you moved among these mysteries,\t\nAbsorbed and smiling and sure;\t\nStirring, tasting, measuring,\t\nWith the precision of a ritual.\t\nI like to think of you in your years of power\u2014\t\nYou, now so shaken and so powerless\u2014\t\nHigh priestess of your home."}
