{"subject": "Flowers", "text": "Thank God I love the Flowers!\nMute voices of the Spring,\nThat gladden all her bowers\nWith their varied blossoming;\nThey weave a charm around them\nOn each summer dale and bough,\nFor a Fairy train has bound them\nIn wreaths upon her brow.\n\nFar up along the mountain,\nAnd in the valleys green,\nIn the field, and by the fountain,\nThe smiling ones are seen;\nSome looking up to heaven,\nWith eyes of deepest blue;\nSome stooping down at even\nTo quaff the sparkling dew.\n\nAnd from them all there speaketh\nA language sweet and pure,\nFitted for him who seeketh\nA God's nomenclature.\nAs tidal pulses thrill the seas,\nAnd moments build the hours,\nHeaven breathes her unvoiced mysteries\nIn sermons from the Flowers."}
