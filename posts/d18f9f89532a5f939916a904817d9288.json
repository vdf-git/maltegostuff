{"subject": "Ballade: Epistre", "text": "Have pity now, have pity now on me,\nIf you at least would, friends of mine.\nI'm in the depths, not holly or may,\nIn exile, where I've been consigned\nBy Fortune, as God too has designed.\nGirls, lovers, youngsters, fresh to hand,\nDancers, tumblers that leap like lambs,\nAgile as arrows, like shots from a cannon,\nThroats tinkling, clear as bells on rams,\nWill you leave him here, your poor old Villon?\n\nSingers, singing in lawless freedom,\nJokers, pleasant in word and deed,\nRun free of false gold, alloy, come,\nMen of wit - somewhat deaf indeed -\nHurry, be quick now, he's dying poor man.\nMakers of lays, motets and rondeaux,\nWill you bring him warmth when he's down below?\nNo lightning or storm reach where he's gone.\nWith these thick walls they've blinded him so.\nWill you leave him here, your poor old Villon?\n\nCome see him here, in his piteous plight,\nNoblemen, free of tax and tithe,\nHolding nothing by king or emperor's right,\nBut by grace of the God of Paradise.\nSundays and Tuesdays he fasts and sighs,\nHis teeth are as sharp as the rats' below,\nAfter dry bread, and no gateaux,\nWater for soup that floats his guts along.\nWith no table or chair, he's lying low.\nWill you leave him here, your poor old Villon?\n\nPrinces of note, old, new, don't fail:\nBeg the king's pardon for me, and seal,\nAnd a basket to raise me, I'll sit upon:\nSo pigs behave, to each other, they say,\nWhen one pig squeals, all rush that way.\nWill you leave him here, your poor old Villon?"}
