{"subject": "Twilight At Little Harbor", "text": "This time no one's lookng for love\ndown between the sheds, the old houses, among the twittering\nmasts and rigging. A boat, a prau that will never sail again\npuffs and snorts, thinking there's something it can catch \nThe drizzle brings darkness. An eagle's wings flap,\nbrushing against the gloom; the day whispers, swimming silkily\naway to meet harbor temptations yet to come. Nothing moves\nand now the sand and the sea are asleep, the waves gone. \n\nThat's all. I'm alone. Walking,\ncombing the cape, still choking back the hope\nof getting to the end and, just once, saying the hell with it\nfrom this fourth beach, embracing the last, the final sob."}
