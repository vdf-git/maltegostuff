{"subject": "From Horace: Book Ii:Ode Ii", "text": "Renown'd for lyric and satiric lay,\nA two-fold poet, I\nShall on strong wing be upward borne\nAbove the liquid sky;\nNo more shall earth my spirit bind-\nTo heav'n I'll soar, and envy leave behind.\n\nNo! my Maecenas, who wast ever just,\nA witness to my worth,\nBy whom I'm counted as a friend,\nDespite my humble birth;\nI shall not lie forgotten in the grave,\nOr pine encircled by the Stygian wave.\n\nRough grows my skin: anon, my upper half\nIs changed into a swan;\nSoft down and plumage sprout apace,\nMy arms and fingers on;\nThan Daedalus more swift I soar,\nAnd flap my wings o'er groaning Bosphorus' shore.\n\nBy Scythian stream and Colchian shore,\nWhere Rhine majestic flows,\nWhere dwell the Dacians wont to hide\nTheir fear of Roman foes,\nO'er Afric's sand, and Hyperborean plain,\nShall sweep in cadence soft my touching strain.\n\nFor me I ask no funeral chant\nWhen soaring out of sight;\nUnfit the mourner's sighs and tears\nTo grace my glorious flight:\nLet solemn silence rule the general mien,\nAnd no vain pageant crown the closing scene."}
