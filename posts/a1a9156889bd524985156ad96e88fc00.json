{"subject": "A Heavenly Muse", "text": "Air - 'Miss Carmichael.'\nA Heavenly muse in green Erin is singing, \nHis strains, all seraphic, ascend to the skies;\nFair blossoms of Eden, around him all springing,\nThe soft balmy ether perfume as they rise.\nSweet poet! be true to thy lofty aspiring,\nWhile, bound by thy magic, the sky's half unfurl'd;\nYouth, beauty, and taste are with rapture admiring;\nO! spread not around them the fumes of this world!"}
