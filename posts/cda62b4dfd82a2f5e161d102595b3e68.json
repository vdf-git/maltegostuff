{"subject": "To Fancy", "text": "Most delicate Ariel! submissive thing, \nWon by the mind's high magic to its hest\u2014 \nInvisible embassy, or secret guest,\u2014 \nWeighing the light air on a lighter wing;\u2014 \nWhether into the midnight moon, to bring \nIlluminate visions to the eye of rest,\u2014 \nOr rich romances from the florid West,\u2014 \nOr to the sea, for mystic whispering,\u2014 \nStill by thy charm'd allegiance to the will, \nThe fruitful wishes prosper in the brain, \nAs by the fingering of fairy skill,\u2014 \nMoonlight, and waters, and soft music's strain, \nOdors, and blooms, and my Miranda's smile, \nMaking this dull world an enchanted isle."}
