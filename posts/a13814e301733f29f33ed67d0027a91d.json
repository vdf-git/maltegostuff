{"subject": "The Idle Shepherd Boys", "text": "The valley rings with mirth and joy;\nAmong the hills the echoes play\nA never never ending song,\nTo welcome in the May.\nThe magpie chatters with delight;\nThe mountain raven's youngling brood\nHave left the mother and the nest;\nAnd they go rambling east and west\nIn search of their own food;\nOr through the glittering vapors dart\nIn very wantonness of heart.\n\nBeneath a rock, upon the grass,\nTwo boys are sitting in the sun;\nTheir work, if any work they have,\nIs out of mind---or done.\nOn pipes of sycamore they play\nThe fragments of a Christmas hymn;\nOr with that plant which in our dale\nWe call stag-horn, or fox's tail,\nTheir rusty hats they trim:\nAnd thus, as happy as the day,\nThose Shepherds wear the time away.\n\nAlong the river's stony marge\nThe sand-lark chants a joyous song;\nThe thrush is busy in the wood,\nAnd carols loud and strong.\nA thousand lambs are on the rocks,\nAll newly born! both earth and sky\nKeep jubilee, and more than all,\nThose boys with their green coronal;\nThey never hear the cry,\nThat plaintive cry! which up the hill\nComes from the depth of Dungeon-Ghyll.\n\nSaid Walter, leaping from the ground,\n'Down to the stump of yon old yew\nWe'll for our whistles run a race.'\nAway the shepherds flew;\nThey leapt---they ran---and when they came\nRight opposite to Dungeon-Ghyll,\nSeeing that he should lose the prize,\n'Stop! ' to his comrade Walter cries---\nJames stopped with no good will:\nSaid Walter then, exulting; 'Here\nYou'll find a task for half a year.\n\nCross, if you dare, where I shall cross---\nCome on, and tread where I shall tread.'\nThe other took him at his word,\nAnd followed as he led.\nIt was a spot which you may see\nIf ever you to Langdale go;\nInto a chasm a mighty block\nHath fallen, and made a bridge of rock:\nThe gulf is deep below;\nAnd, in a basin black and small,\nReceives a lofty waterfall.\n\nWith staff in hand across the cleft\nThe challenger pursued his march;\nAnd now, all eyes and feet, hath gained\nThe middle of the arch.\nWhen list! he hears a piteous moan---\nAgain !---his heart within him dies---\nHis pulse is stopped, his breath is lost,\nHe totters, pallid as a ghost,\nAnd, looking down, espies\nA lamb, that in the pool is pent\nWithin that black and frightful rent.\n\nThe lamb had slipped into the stream,\nAnd safe without a bruise or wound\nThe cataract had borne him down\nInto the gulf profound.\nHis dam had seen him when he fell,\nShe saw him down the torrent borne;\nAnd, while with all a mother's love\nShe from the lofty rocks above\nSent forth a cry forlorn,\nThe lamb, still swimming round and round,\nMade answer to that plaintive sound.\n\nWhen he had learnt what thing it was,\nThat sent this rueful cry; I ween\nThe Boy recovered heart, and told\nThe sight which he had seen.\nBoth gladly now deferred their task;\nNor was there wanting other aid---\nA Poet, one who loves the brooks\nFar better than the sages' books,\nBy chance had thither strayed;\nAnd there the helpless lamb he found\nBy those huge rocks encompassed round.\n\nHe drew it from the troubled pool,\nAnd brought it forth into the light:\nThe Shepherds met him with his charge,\nAn unexpected sight!\nInto their arms the lamb they took,\nWhose life and limbs the flood had spared;\nThen up the steep ascent they hied,\nAnd placed him at his mother's side;\nAnd gently did the Bard\nThose idle Shepherd-Boys upbraid,\nAnd bade them better mind their trade."}
