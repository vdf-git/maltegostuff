{"subject": "On The Oregon Trail", "text": "We're the prairie pilgrim crew,\nSailin' with the sun,\nLookin' West to meet a great reward,\nTrailin' toward a land that's new\nLike our fathers done,\nTrustin' in our rifles and the Lord.\n\nA-ll set! Go ahead!\nOut the prairie trail.\nLeave the woods and settlements behind.\nTrail and settle, work and fight\nTill the rollin' earth is white,\u2014\nThat's the law and gospel of our kind.\n\nDesert suns and throats o' dust,\nBut we never stop;\nWimmin-folks are knittin' as they ride.\nWe're a breed that, when we must,\nFight until we drop,\nBut our work and git-thar is our pride.\n\nA-ll set! Go ahead!\nUp the sandy Platte.\nLeave the circle smokin' in the dawn,\nSo the comin' hosts will know,\n'Mongst the trails of buffalo\nWhere their darin' brother whites have gone.\n\nNight so black 'twould blind a fox,\nYells and feathered sleet,\nAim the best you kin and trust to luck.\nArrows whang the wagon box\nBut all hell kaint beat\nRifles from Missoury and Kentuck.\n\nA-ll set! Go ahead!\nLeave the dead to sleep\nTill the desert sees the Judgment Day.\nMourn the good boys laid so low,\nBut we'll mourn them on the go\u2014\nPawnee! Ogalalla! Cl'ar the way!\n\nFar across the glarin' plain\nSee the mountain peaks\nGlimmer 'long the edge like flecks o' foam.\nShove! you oxen, till your chain\nStretches out and squeaks;\nSomewhere out beyond that range is Home!\n\nA-ll set! Go ahead!\nTrailin' toward the West\nTill the sunset's shinin' flag is furled.\nAy, our flag's the Western skies,\nFlag that drew our fathers' eyes,\nFlag that leads the white man 'round the world."}
