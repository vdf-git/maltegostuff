{"subject": "A Prayer", "text": "O vermeil mouth that I have kissed in vain,\nO hair that was a golden web of pain,\nWoven to hold my heart! -\n\nSince you are lost, and Love is fled from me,\nWith you I fain would lose Love's memory,\nAnd let my dream depart.\n\nO arms, O bosom, white as foam or fire,\nMade warm for my delight and my desire,\nReturn, return to me -\n\nOr take with you the passion and the pain,\nThe lonely grief, the longing all in vain,\nThe dream, the memory."}
