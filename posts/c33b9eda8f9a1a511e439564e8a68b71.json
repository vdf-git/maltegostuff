{"subject": "The Sound Of Silence", "text": "Everything lies in silence\nMaybe you and me\nJust like a beautiful spring\nListening to the sound of silence.\n\nAll the time used to noise\nWe think this is very nice\nBut let me tell you my friend\nEverything lies in silence\nFrom the beginning to the end.\n\nIn the very beginning of this world\nEverything was resting in the silence\nIn the end of this world again\nThere would be nothing in the world\nOther than the sound of silence."}
