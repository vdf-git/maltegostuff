{"subject": "Mothers", "text": "A mother's love, a Mother's care,\n A mother's sigh, a Mother's prayer\n A Mother's work, and Mother's day,\n Leaves little time for any play.\n\n A godly Mother with godly love,\n Is treasure from God above,\n A godly Mother with godly above,\n A godly Mother with godly care,\n Has God's help when she sighs a prayer."}
