{"subject": "Mark X. 14.", "text": "WAS there a love on earth like His, \nWho left His throne on high, \nAnd changed His own celestial bliss \nFor human agony? \nAnd He, who in humility \nBowed even to the tomb, \nHath in His mercy said, 'To me \n'Let little children come!' \n\nOh, blessed babes! who fearlessly \nMight lift your eyes to Him, \nAnd that benignant glory see, \nThat grosser orbs might dim; \nWhose hearts, as opening flowers, might feel \nThe power of righteousness, \nLike holy dew, upon them steal, \nImbuing each recess. \n\nOh, blessed babes! who, unreproved, \nMight sit before His feet,\u2014 \nMight freely love, because He loved, \u2014 \nMight live in converse sweet! \nWherefore were ye the chosen band, \nCalled to His presence here, \nWhilst others pale and trembling stand, \nWavering 'twixt hope and fear? \n\nBecause your hands were free from sin, \nYour hearts from earthly pride; \nBecause no passion's power within, \nYour spirit's depths had tried; \nBecause your trust was perfect trust, \nYour love unstained by clay; \nAnd from your souls earth's sinful dust \nHis mercy washed away. \n\nOh, Saviour! are we, then, unbought, \nExcluded from thy light? \nMay not our elder hearts be taught \nTo feel Thy truth aright? \nSoften our pride, thy vengeance wreak \nOn sins that have defiled, \nAnd make us humble, pure, and meek, \nEven as a little child!"}
