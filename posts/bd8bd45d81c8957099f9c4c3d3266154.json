{"subject": "Friendship", "text": "I think awhile of Love, and while I think, \nLove is to me a world, \nSole meat and sweetest drink, \nAnd close connecting link \nTween heaven and earth. \n\nI only know it is, not how or why, \nMy greatest happiness; \nHowever hard I try, \nNot if I were to die, \nCan I explain. \n\nI fain would ask my friend how it can be, \nBut when the time arrives, \nThen Love is more lovely \nThan anything to me, \nAnd so I'm dumb. \n\nFor if the truth were known, Love cannot speak, \nBut only thinks and does; \nThough surely out 'twill leak \nWithout the help of Greek, \nOr any tongue. \n\nA man may love the truth and practise it, \nBeauty he may admire, \nAnd goodness not omit, \nAs much as may befit \nTo reverence. \n\nBut only when these three together meet, \nAs they always incline, \nAnd make one soul the seat, \nAnd favorite retreat, \nOf loveliness; \n\nWhen under kindred shape, like loves and hates \nAnd a kindred nature, \nProclaim us to be mates, \nExposed to equal fates \nEternally; \n\nAnd each may other help, and service do, \nDrawing Love's bands more tight, \nService he ne'er shall rue \nWhile one and one make two, \nAnd two are one; \n\nIn such case only doth man fully prove \nFully as man can do, \nWhat power there is in Love \nHis inmost soul to move \nResistlessly. \n\n______ \n\nTwo sturdy oaks I mean, which side by side, \nWithstand the winter's storm, \nAnd spite of wind and tide, \nGrow up the meadow's pride, \nFor both are strong \n\nAbove they barely touch, but undermined \nDown to their deepest source, \nAdmiring you shall find \nTheir roots are intertwined \nInsep'rably."}
