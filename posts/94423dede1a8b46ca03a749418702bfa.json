{"subject": "Reconciliation", "text": "LISTEN, dearest! you must love me more,\nMore than you did before! \u2014\nHark, what a beating here of wings!\nNever at rest,\nDear, in your breast! \u2014\nIs it your heart with its flutterings,\nMaking a music, love, for us both?\nOr merely a moth, a velvet-winged moth,\nWhich out of the garden's fragrance swings,\nWeaving a spell,\nThat holds the rose and the moon in thrall? \u2014\nI love you more than I can tell;\nAnd no recall\nHow long ago\nOur quarrel and all! \u2014\nYou say, you know,\nA perfect pearl grows out of \u2014 well,\nA little friction; tiny grain\nOf sand or shell \u2014\nSo love grew out of that moment's pain,\nThe heart's disdain \u2014\nSince then I have thought of no one but you, \nAnd how your heart would beat on mine, \nLike light on dew. \nAnd I thought how foolish to fret and pine! \nBetter to claim the fault all mine! \nTo go to you and tell you that: \nAnd how stale and flat \nAll life without you was, and vain! \nAnd when I came, you turned and smiled, \nLike a darling child, \nAnd I knew from your look that, in your heart, \nYou had followed the self-same train \nOf thought that made me yours again. \u2014 \nDearest! no more! \u2014\nWe shall never part! \u2014\nSo. Turn your face as you did before.\u2014\nI smooth your brow\nAnd kiss you.\u2014 Now\u2026\nTell me true \u2014\nDid you miss me, dear, as I missed you?"}
