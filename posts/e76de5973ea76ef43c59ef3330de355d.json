{"subject": "My Reputation", "text": "My reputation I build each day \nI lay a block each time I pray \nIt opens doors for me you see \nMy reputation's really me \nI'm front and center every day \nWhen I let Jesus have his way \nThe mountains that were there by day \nHis precious blood will melt away. My reputation I need it most \nIt follows me from coast to coast \nIt's in each book of poems I write \nIt gives me peace both day and night \nIt helps me lay another block \nMy reputation is my walk \nSo I don't have to fear today \nMy reputation's here to stay."}
