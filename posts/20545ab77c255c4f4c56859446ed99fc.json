{"subject": "I'M Going To Forgive", "text": "You've done me dirty all of my life.\nI kept forgiving you until you slept with my wife.\nWhen we were fourteen, I sold my motorcycle and you stole the money.\nI thought it was horrible but you thought it was funny.\nYou were a lowlife jerk and a crook.\nBut because you were my best friend, I always let you off the hook.\nWhen I caught you and my wife in bed, I couldn't believe what I saw.\nI forgave you for everything else but this was the last straw.\nBefore I kicked you out of my life, I told you that you don't deserve to live.\nThat was several years ago and now I'm ready to forgive.\nI'm forgiving you because I've learned that I'm dying.\nWhen the doctor told me that I have cancer, I couldn't stop crying.\nThere's something I have to do and I don't have long.\nI'm going to forgive all of the people who have done me wrong."}
