{"subject": "Eternal Youth", "text": "Because I'm here and seen it all, makes some blind to the fall \nNever lie, just twist the truth. Prices paid for eternal youth Stayed right here but traveled far, wandered by a shooting star \nDreamed of one who astray was led. Love and anger, felt not said To myself back again, rainy days, fair-weather friends \nKnow it all yet speak no sooth. Prices paid for eternal youth Try my best to carry on, sometimes right and always wrong \nNext to you I saw the truth. Prices paid for eternal youth \nPriceless paid. Eternal youth."}
