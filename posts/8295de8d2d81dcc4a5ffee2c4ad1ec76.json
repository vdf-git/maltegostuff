{"subject": "Are Ye Right, There, Michael?", "text": "You may talk of Columbus's sailing\nAcross the Atlantical Sea\nBut he never tried to go railing\nFrom Ennis as far as Kilkee\nYou run for the train in the morning,\nThe excursion train starting at eight\nYou're there when the clock gives the warnin'\nAnd there for an hour you'll wait\nAnd as you're waiting in the train,\nYou'll hear the guard sing this refrain-\n\nAre ye right there, Michael, are ye right?\nDo you think that we'll be there before the night?\nYe've been so long in startin',\nThat ye couldn't say for startin'\nStill ye might now, Michael,\nSo ye might!\n\nThey find out where the engine's been hiding,\nAnd it drags you to Sweet Corofin;\nSays the guard, Back her down on the siding\nThere's the goods from Kilrush comin' in.\nPerhaps it comes in two hours,\nPerhaps it breaks down on the way;\nIf it does, says the guard, be the powers,\nWe're here for the rest of the day!\n\nSpoken:\nAnd while you sit and curse your luck\nThe train backs down into a truck.\n\nAre ye right there, Michael, are ye right?\nHave ye got the parcel there for Mrs. White?\nYe haven't, oh begorra,\nSay it's comin' down tomorra - \nAnd well it might now, Michael,\nSo it might.\n\nAt Lahinch the sea shines like a jewel,\nWith joy you are ready to shout,\nWhen the stoker cries out, There's no fuel,\nAnd the fire's taytotally out.\nBut hand up that bit of log there - \nI'll soon have ye out of the fix;\nThere's fine clamp of turf in the bog there.\nAnd the rest go a-gatherin' sticks.\n\nSpoken:\nAnd while you're breakin' bits of tree,\nYou hear some wise remarks like these -\n\nAre ye right there, Michael? Are ye right?\nDo ye think that you can get the fire to light?\nOh an hour you'll require,\nFor the turf it might be drier - \nWell it might now, Michael,\nSo it might."}
