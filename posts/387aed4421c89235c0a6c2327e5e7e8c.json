{"subject": "Flor Del Espiritu Santo", "text": "Loitering, midst the tropic glory of a large conservatory\nWhere the warm moist air was heavy with a cloud of rich perfume,\nI beheld a strange plant flowering, where the stately palms were towering,\nWith a quaint, peculiar odor and an oddly fashioned bloom.\n\nNot the beauty of its color, nor the sweetness of its odor,\nLured me to the unknown stranger, as above its bloom I bent,\nBut a tiny dove perched quaintly, with an air serene and saintly\nIn the heart of each odd blossom, nestling there in sweet content.\n\nO'er each opening bud I pondered, and in after moments wondered\nIf each passer-by who saw it, learned its voiceless ministry;\nIn each flower a revelation, a symbolic-like creation\nOf a heart where sweetly dwelleth the white dove of purity.\n\nFrom its native land they brought it, but a higher wisdom wrought it.\nFor a high and nobler calling, rocks may preach and ripples sing;\nBut who from its sanctum turning, no grand lesson from it learning,\nHears not eloquence in Nature, gains not good from everything.\n\nOdd dove orchid, silent preacher, thou hast come a living teacher\nOf the rarest human virtue, of the noblest excellence\nHow these thronging thousands need you, but alas! how few will heed you\nAnd their hearts' dark raven banish for the doves of innocence!"}
