{"subject": "Four Springtimes Lost: And In The Fifth We Stand", "text": "Four springtimes lost: and in the fifth we stand, \nhere in this quiet hour of glory, still, \nwhile o'er the bridal land \nthe westering sun dwells in untroubled gold, \na bridegroom proud of his permitted will, \nwhom grateful rapture suffers not be bold, \nbut tender now and bland \nhis amber locks and bended gaze are shed, \nbrimming, above the couch'd and happy clime: \nall is content and ripe delight, full-fed. \nAnd as your fingers brush my hand \nso too the winning time \nwould charm me from regretful reverie \nthat keeps me somewhat sad, remembering \u2014 \nnot the old woodland days, for thou art near \nand hold'st them safely hid \nto rise and shine again, when waning skies shall bid \u2014 \nbut later dawns o' the year, away from thee \nliv'd thro', even here, \nand golden embraces of the light-hearted time \nwhen I was sad at heart, remembering \nthe clear enchantments of our single year, \nour woodland prime of love, its violet-budded vow, \nreceding ever now \nfarther and farther down the past, a gleam \nthat turns to softest pearl the luminous haze \ndrifting between in from the golden days \nwhen I was sad at inmost heart, remembering \nthee and the woodland season of bright laughter: \u2014 \nso in my perverse and most loitering dream \n(O fading, fading days!) \neach season claims the homage due, long after \nits glory has faded to an outcast thing."}
