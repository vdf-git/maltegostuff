{"subject": "Cannot Open The Loop", "text": "When I am completely denuded\nOf my tremors, \nI come at peace with my skin.\nBurnt by raw blaze of reality\nThe brilliant confusion of today.\n\nPromising night\nselects the partners of grief.\nVacantly I fix my eyes on stars.\n\nThe words will never convey the silence\nthe mystery of eternal search\namongst the  ruins of dreams.\n\nTongue falters on recitation of factuality\nOver coming the rage.\nFatal dichotomy of life and death\nstarts sleepwalking.\n\nGulf widens the shores\nseeking in metaphysical depth.\nSpeech does not bring solace\nmathematics cannot open the loop."}
