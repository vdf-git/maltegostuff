{"subject": "On Friendship", "text": "Your friend is your needs answered.\nHe is your field which you sow with love and reap with thanksgiving.\nAnd he is your board and your fireside.\nFor you come to him with your hunger, and you seek him for peace.\nWhen your friend speaks his mind you fear not the 'nay' in your own mind, nor do you withhold the 'ay.'\nAnd when he is silent your heart ceases not to listen to his heart;\nFor without words, in friendship, all thoughts, all desires, all expectations are born and shared, with joy that is unacclaimed.\nWhen you part from your friend, you grieve not;\nFor that which you love most in him may be clearer in his absence, as the mountain to the climber is clearer from the plain.\nAnd let there be no purpose in friendship save the deepening of the spirit.\nFor love that seeks aught but the disclosure of its own mystery is not love but a net cast forth: and only the unprofitable is caught.\nAnd let your best be for your friend.\nIf he must know the ebb of your tide, let him know its flood also.\nFor what is your friend that you should seek him with hours to kill?\nSeek him always with hours to live.\nFor it is his to fill your need, but not your emptiness.\nAnd in the sweetness of friendship let there be laughter, and sharing of pleasures.\nFor in the dew of little things the heart finds its morning and is refreshed."}
