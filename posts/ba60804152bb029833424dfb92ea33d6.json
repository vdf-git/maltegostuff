{"subject": "A Fair Deal", "text": "She was in my place\nBurning her hands when cooking,\nDandling the dolls,\nFeeding the cats,\nWaiting for children to come.\nShe was in my room\nTearing up gospels,\nScratching a cross on her chest\nTo let the woman out\nSpread her own blue sheets\nAnd fluff up pillows.\nEvery day she visited the graveyard\nTo steal two flowers\nFrom her mother's and her brother's grave\nAnd put them on her father's stone,\nWhere no flowers would grow.\nShe returned\nWith sacks of bread and potatoes,\nAnd burned her fingers in the kitchen\nOnce more.\nShe was in my bed\nDripping oil in dry pipes,\nReading a book\nWith faded lettering,\nLightened by a crippled scream.\nShe used to be in love.\nWhen she knew that hatred\nIs an art,\nShe slept with al-Hutaya\nAnd gave birth to an army of children,\nHeadless,\nIn baggy trousers.\nSatan\nIs a nice old man,\nWho suffered a million years for our sake\nAnd but once spat\nIn our faces.\nTherefore,\nIt was a fair deal\nWhen she exchanged the children's flesh\nFor a blank notebook,\nSeventy five pencils\nAnd a book by Goethe.\nA left-handed, lame woman\nWas in my cocoon\nThen she flew away.\n\nTranslated by Kees Nijland"}
