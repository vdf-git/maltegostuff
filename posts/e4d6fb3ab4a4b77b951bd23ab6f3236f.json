{"subject": "Sonnet Xxxii. The Christian Pilgrim", "text": "Farewell, my native country! Thy bright star,\nThy sky, green woods, clear waters, no more greet\nMine eye delighted. But with pilgrim feet,\nIn waste and horrid lands, I wander far.\nI wander far, unknown, but not dismayed;\nI leave my native country; but my soul,\nUnmoved, unshaken, in its purpose whole,\nOn higher power, than aught of earth, is stayed.\nMy God shall be my country! I will call,\nAnd he will hear me in the desert place.\nWhen troubles come, before his feet I fall,\nAnd then he sheds the sunshine of his grace.\nOn Afric's arid sands, on Asia's plain,\nOn Greenland's ice-bound coast, no prayer to Him is vain."}
