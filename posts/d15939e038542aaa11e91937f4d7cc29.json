{"subject": "Inscription", "text": "DAY after day,\nAs I have wandered thro' the fields of life\u2014\nGay, happy fields, bright with the sun and sky\u2014\n                    Flower after flower\n                    Has bloomed beside my path;\n5\nAnd I have gathered them, a long-loved handful,\n                    Which I offer now\nTo the unpitying, cruel-laughing world.\n                    And some are gay,\nSparkling with joy and the bright sun of hope;\n10\n                    And some are sad,\nDipped in the crimson of the setting sun,\nOr blasted by the cold of winter winds;\n                    Buy all the roots\nAre down, far down, within the spirit's depths,\n15\nAmid the voiceless shadows of the soul,\n                    And each has sprung\nFrom the warm life-blood throbbing in my heart"}
