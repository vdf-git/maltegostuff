{"subject": "Good-Night", "text": "THE lark is silent in his nest,\nThe breeze is sighing in its flight,\nSleep, Love, and peaceful be thy rest.\nGood-night, my love, good-night, good-night.\nSweet dreams' attend thee in thy sleep,\nTo soothe thy rest till morning's light,\nAnd angels round thee vigil keep.\nGood-night, my love, good-night, good-night.\nSleep well, my love, on night's dark breast,\nAnd ease thy soul with slumber bright;\nBe joy but thine and I am blest.\nGood-night, my love, good-night, good-night."}
