{"subject": "The Long March", "text": "The Red Army fears not the trials of the March, \nHolding light ten thousand crags and torrents. \nThe Five Ridges wind like gentle ripples \nAnd the majestic Wumeng roll by, globules of clay. \nWarm the steep cliffs lapped by the waters of Golden Sand, \nCold the iron chains spanning the Tatu River. \nMinshan's thousand li of snow joyously crossed, \nThe three Armies march on, each face glowing."}
