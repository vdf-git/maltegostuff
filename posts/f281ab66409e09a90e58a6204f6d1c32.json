{"subject": "Autumn Frost", "text": "The morning sun shows like a pillar\nOf fire through smoke on frosty days.\nAs on a faulty snap, it cannot\nMake out my features in the haze.\n\nThe distant trees will hardly see me\nUntil the sun at last can break\nOut of the fog, and flash triumphant\nUpon the meadows by the lake.\n\nA passer-by in mist receding\nIs recognized when he has passed.\nYou walk on hoarfrost-covered pathways\nAs though on mats of plaited bast.\n\nThe frost is covered up in gooseflesh,\nThe air is false like painted cheeks,\nThe earth is shivering, and sick of\nBreathing potato-stalks for weeks."}
