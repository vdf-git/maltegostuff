{"subject": "Two Loves", "text": "The woman he loved, while he dreamed of her, \n Danced on till the stars grew dim, \nBut alone with her heart, from the world apart\n Sat the woman who loved him.\n\nThe woman he worshipped only smiled\n When he poured out his passionate love.\nBut the other somewhere, kissed her treasure most rare, \n A book he had touched with his glove.\n\nThe woman he loved betrayed his trust, \n And he wore the scars for life; \nAnd he cared not, nor knew, that the other was true; \n But no man called her his wife.\n\nThe woman he loved trod festal halls, \n While they sang his funeral hymn, \nBut the sad bells tolled, ere the year was old, \n For the woman that loved him."}
