{"subject": "Sonnet 59: If There Be Nothing New, But That Which Is", "text": "If there be nothing new, but that which is\nHath been before, how are our brains beguiled,\nWhich, labouring for invention bear amis\nThe second burthen of a former child!\nO, that record could with a backward look,\nEven of five hundred courses of the sun,\nShow me your image in some antique book,\nSince mind at first in character was done.\nThat I might see what the old world could say\nTo this compos\u00e8d wonder of your frame;\nWhether we are mended, or whe'er better they,\nOr whether revolution be the same.\n    O, sure I am the wits of former days\n    To subjects worse have given admiring praise."}
