{"subject": "I Was A Seed Once", "text": "Who put me as a seed \ninto the earth? \nWho gave me strength to grow? I feel the warmth,  \nthe tender rays of sun, \nI grow. \nI will not be a weed, \nI know. The rain has moistened me, \nmy leaves need freedom, \nso, I break the earth \nand there I'll feed them. I am a rose now, \na motley-colored one, \nbut I have thorns, \nafraid of none. And I'll please the world \nand act in tender ways \nI'll send my thanks to God \ndispersing warmest rays."}
