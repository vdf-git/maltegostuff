{"subject": "In Tuolumne Meadows", "text": "I Love to sit in the sun\nAnd watch the foaming Lyell\nLeap over its granite bed. \nI love these days that run \nOn a burnished golden dial \nWith the blue sky overhead.\n\nI love to waken at night\nAnd whisper the stars above me, \nAnd feel the fingering breeze. \nSo still is the world, so right,\nWhere even the black pines love me, \nAnd the white moon guards my ease.\n\nI love the upward ways\nTo the sun-tipped crest of the mountains\nHigh over the billowy world; \nWhere the wind sings hymns of praise,\nAnd the snows break into fountains, \nAnd life is a flag unfurled.\n\nI love\u2014ah, beloved, what bliss \nWould shatter the ice like a river \nAnd sing all the way to the sea, \nIf the world could be lost for this, \nAnd you from your sorrow forever \nCould rest on the heart of me !"}
