{"subject": "When Your Hope Is Gone", "text": "My heart grew more fonder. \nEach time I saw you at your best.  \nSo happy and wholesome. \nAnd filled with cheerfulness. \nThen suddenly you began to falter. \nAnd your eyes grew dim \nBut you'd always remember to give praise to him \nThen slowly, as you grew weaker each day. \nTears came to my eyes each time, I'd see you kneel and pray. \nFor life is short, and oh so brief. \nTo see you in such pain, brought my heart such grief. \nSo gather around you, all of you love ones. \nDon't just sit there all alone. \nThere's nothing left but sadness, when your hope is gone."}
