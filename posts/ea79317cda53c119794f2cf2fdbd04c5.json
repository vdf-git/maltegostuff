{"subject": "Words to Accompany a Bunch of Cornflowers", "text": "Those beads of lapis, even the classical\nBlues of dawn, are dimmed by comparison.\nWhen I hand you this bunch of cornflowers\nThe only other color in the room\nIllumines your eyes as you arrange them.\n\nThey are the blue reflection of whatever\nMoves in you, serene as cool water tipped\nInto crystal, oddly enough the willing bride\nTo a cloudy head of melancholy\nSo deeply blue it could prove musical.\n\nThis is the blue John Lee Hooker's gravelly\nVoice in the sundown field was looking for.\nThis is the unrequited dream of an iris.\nIce blue, spruce blue, little periwinkle blue-\nNothing else that dies is exactly so blue."}
