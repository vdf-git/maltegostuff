{"subject": "May Morning", "text": "Over all the watered vale\nShadows of the clouds trail:\nThen the sun laughs out, and sheen\nRuns like joy across the green.\nYoung the leaf is, young the flower;\nRadiant the beeches tower,\nA million tremblings all as one\nDancing forth into the sun.\nAbove the sound of hidden brooks\nBirds sprinkle songs on coppice--nooks,\nEach his private happy note,\nWith small bright eye and rippled throat.\n\nEngland, through whose fields I stray\nIn this heavenly--coloured May,\nEngland, lost in histories\nOlder than her oldest trees,\nWith nested hamlets, each of them\nFlavoured like its ancient name;\nEngland, where my blood began\nAnd moulded childhood into man,\nComes to--day before my eyes\nLike a new--found paradise.\n\nYet I wonder not at this\nWonder, that is half of bliss.\nI have looked into Love's eyes\nLong, and Love has made me wise.\nAs when first one face I knew\nAnd our lips together drew,\nOld in love, my heart to--day\nIs young as the young leaves of May.\n\nToller Porcorum"}
