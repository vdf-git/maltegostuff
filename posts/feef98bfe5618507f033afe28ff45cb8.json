{"subject": "Sonnet Xxix: I Think Of Thee", "text": "I think of thee!--my thoughts do twine and bud \nAbout thee,as wild vines, about a tree, \nPut out broad leaves, and soon there's nought to see \nExcept the straggling green which hides the wood. \nYet, O my palm-tree, be it understood \nI will not have my thoughts instead of thee \nWho art dearer, better! Rather, instantly \nRenew thy presence; as a strong tree should, \nRustle thy boughs and set thy trunk all bare, \nAnd let these bands of greenery which insphere thee \nDrop heavily down,--burst, shattered, everywhere! \nBecause, in this deep joy to see and hear thee \nAnd breathe within thy shadow a new air, \nI do not think of thee--I am too near thee."}
