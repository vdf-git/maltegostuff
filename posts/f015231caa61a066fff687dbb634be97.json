{"subject": "Adventure Of A Poet", "text": "As I was walking down the street \nA week ago, \nNear Henderson's I chanced to meet \nA man I know. \n\nHis name is Alexander Bell, \nHis home, Dundee; \nI do not know him quite so well \nAs he knows me. \n\nHe gave my hand a hearty shake, \nDiscussed the weather, \nAnd then proposed that we should take \nA stroll together. \n\nDown College Street we took our way, \nAnd there we met \nThe beautiful Miss Mary Gray, \nThat arch coquette, \nWho stole last spring my heart away \nAnd has it yet. \n\nThat smile with which my bow she greets, \nWould it were fonder! \nOr else less fond-since she its sweets \nOn all must squander. \n\nThus, when I meet her in the streets, \nI sadly ponder, \nAnd after her, as she retreats, \nMy thoughts will wander. \n\nAnd so I listened with an air \nOf inattention, \nWhile Bell described a folding-chair \nOf his invention. \n\nAnd when we reached the Swilcan Burn, \n'It looks like rain,' \nSaid I, 'and we had better turn.' \n'Twas all in vain, \n\nFor Bell was weather-wise, and knew \nThe signs aerial; \nHe bade me note the strip of blue \nAbove the Imperial, \n\nAlso another patch of sky, \nSouth-west by south, \nWhich meant that we might journey dry \nTo Eden's mouth. \n\nHe was a man with information \nOn many topics: \nHe talked about the exploration \nOf Poles and Tropics, \n\nThe scene in Parliament last night, \nSir William's letter; \n'And do you like the electric light, \nOr gas-lamps better?' \n\nThe strike among the dust-heap pickers \nHe said was over; \nAnd had I read about the liquors \nJust seized at Dover? \n\nOr the unhappy printer lad \nAt Rothesay drowned? \nOr the Italian ironclad \nThat ran aground ? \n\nHe told me stories (lately come) \nOf town society, \nSome slightly tinged with truth, and some \nWith impropriety. \n\nHe spoke of duelling in France, \nThen lightly glanced at \nMrs. Mackenzie's monster dance, \nWhich he had danced at. \n\nSo he ran on, till by-and-by \nA silence came, \nFor which I greatly fear that I \nWas most to blame. \n\nThen neither of us spoke a word \nFor quite a minute \nWhen presently a thought occurred \nWith promise in it. \n\n'How did you like the Shakespeare play \nThe students read \nBy this, the Eden like a bay \nBefore us spread. \n\nNear Eden many softer plots \nOf sand there be; \nOur feet, like Pharaoh's chariots, \nDrave heavily. \n\nAnd ere an answer I could frame, \nHe said that Irving \nOf his extraordinary fame \nWas undeserving, \n\nAnd for his part he thought more highly \nOf Ellen Terry; \nAlthough he knew a girl named Riley \nAt Broughty Ferry, \nWho might be, if she only chose, \nAs great a star, \nShe had a part in the tableaux \nAt the bazaar. \n\nIf I had said but little yet, \nI now said less, \nAnd smoked a home-made cigarette \nIn mute distress. \n\nThe smoke into his face was blown \nBy the wind's action, \nAnd this afforded me, I own, \nSome satisfaction; \n\nBut still his tongue received no check \nTill, coming home, \nWe stood beside the ancient wreck \nAnd watched the foam \n\nWash in among the timbers, now \nSunk deep in sand, \nThough I can well remember how \nI used to stand \n\nOn windy days and hold my hat, \nAnd idly turn \nTo read 'Lovise, Frederikstad' \nUpon her stern.\n\nHer stern long since was buried quite, \nAnd soon no trace \nThe absorbing sand will leave in sight \nTo mark her place. \n\nThis reverie was not permitted \nTo last too long. \nBell's mind had left the stage, and flitted \nTo fields of song. \n\nAnd now he spoke of Marmion \nAnd Lewis Morris; \nThe former he at school had done, \nAlong with Horace. \n\nHis maiden aunts, no longer young, \nBut learned ladies, \nHad lately sent him Songs Unsung, \nEpic of Hades, \n\nGycia, and Gwen. He thought them fine; \nNot like that Browning, \nOf whom he would not read a line, \nHe told me, frowning. \n\nTalking of Horace -- very clever \nBeyond a doubt, \nBut what the Satires meant, he never \nYet could make out. \n\nI said I relished Satire Nine \nOf the First Book; \nBut he had skipped to the divine \nEliza Cook. \n\nHe took occasion to declare, \nIn tones devoted, \nHow much he loved her old Arm-chair, \nWhich now he quoted. \n\nAnd other poets he reviewed, \nSome two or three, \nTill, having touched on Thomas Hood, \nHe turned to me. \n\n'Have you been stringing any rhymes \nOf late?' he said. \nI could not lie, but several times \nI shook my head. \n\nThe last straw to the earth will bow \nThe overloaded camel, \nAnd surely I resembled now \nThat ill-used mammal. \n\nSee how a thankless world regards \nThe gifted choir \nOf minstrels, singers, poets, bards, \nWho sweep the lyre. \n\nThis is the recompense we meet \nIn our vocation. \nWe bear the burden and the heat \nOf inspiration; \n\nThe beauties of the earth we sing \nIn glowing numbers, \nAnd to the 'reading public' bring \nPost-prandial slumbers ; \n\nWe save from Mammon's gross dominion \nThese sordid times .... \nAnd all this, in the world's opinion, \nIs 'stringing rhymes.' \n\nIt is as if a man should say, \nIn accents mild, \n'Have you been stringing beads to-day, \nMy gentle child?' \n\n(Yet even children fond of singing \nWill pay off scores, \nAnd I to-day at least am stringing \nNot beads but bores.) \n\nAnd now the sands were left behind, \nThe Club-house past. \nI wondered, Can I hope to find \nEscape at last,\n\nOr must I take him home to tea, \nAnd bear his chatter \nUntil the last train to Dundee \nShall solve the matter? \n\nBut while I shuddered at the thought \nAnd planned resistance, \nMy conquering Alexander caught \nSight in the distance \n\nOf two young ladies, one of whom \nIs his ambition; \nAnd so, with somewhat heightened bloom, \nHe asked permission \n\nTo say good-bye to me and follow. \nI freely gave it, \nAnd wished him all success. \nApollo Sic me servavit."}
