{"subject": "Lines To Miss C.", "text": "On her leaving the Country\n\nSince Friendship soon must bid a fond adieu,\nAnd, parting, wish your charms she never knew,\nDear Laura hear one genuine thought express'd,\nWarm from the heart, and to the heart address'd:-\nMuch do I wish you all your soul holds dear,\nTo sooth and sweeten ev'ry trouble here;\nBut heav'n has yielded such an ample store,\nYou cannot ask, nor can I wish you, more;\nBless'd with a sister's love, whose gentle mind,\nStill pure tho' polish'd, virtuous and refin'd,\nWill aid your tend'rer years and innocence\nBeneath the shelter of her riper sense.\nCharm'd with the bright example may you move,\nAnd, loving, richly copy what you love.\nAdieu! and blame not if an artless pray'r\nShould, self-directed, ask one moment's care:-\nWhen years and absence shall their shade extend,\nReflect who sighs adieu, and call him-friend."}
