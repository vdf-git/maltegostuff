{"subject": "Lukannon", "text": "I met my mates in the morning (and oh, but I am old!)\nWhere roaring on the ledges the summer ground-swell rolled;\nI heard them lift the chorus that dropped the breakers' song -- \nThe beaches of Lukannon -- two million voices strong!\n\nThe song of pleasant stations beside the salt lagoons,\nThe song of blowing squadrons that shuffled down the dunes,\nThe song of midnight dances that churned the sea to flame -- \nThe beaches of Lukannon -- before the sealers came!\n\nI met my mates in the morning (I'll never meet them more!);\nThey came and went in legions that darkened all the shore.\nAnd through the foam-flecked offing as far as voice could reach\nWe hailed the landing-parties and we sang them up the beach.\n\nThe beaches of Lukannon -- the winter-wheat so tall -- \nThe dripping, crinkled lichens, and the sea-fog drenching all!\nThe platforms of our playground, all shining smooth and worn!\nThe beaches of Lukannon -- the home where we were born!\n\nI meet my mates in the morning, a broken, scattered band.\nMen shoot us in the water and club us on the land;\nMen drive us to the Salt House like silly sheep and tame,\nAnd still we sing Lukannon -- before the sealers came.\n\nWheel down, wheel down to southward; oh, Gooverooska go!\nAnd tell the Deep-Sea Viceroys! the story of our woe;\nEre, empty as the shark's egg the tempest flings ashore,\nThe beaches of Lukannon shall know their sons no more!"}
