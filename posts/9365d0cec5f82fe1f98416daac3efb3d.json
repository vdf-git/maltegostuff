{"subject": "Sweet Dreams", "text": "I find the rifle, I drag the rifle\n I open the door to my black cocoon\n I walk inside the black cocoon\n I drag the rifle in and sit on the bed\n I put the rifle under my chin, it feels cool like a breeze\n My mother sees the rifle through the door, she calls for help\n The police come, the cop comes into my room\n He sits on a chair facing me, he talks, I ignore him\n I hear angels singing, the cop stops talking\n The angels stop singing\n There is silence\n I am sorry about my unhappy girlfriend\n I am sorry for the family that loves me\n I move my fingers down the rifle\n I have no choices, I am sick\n I am broken and never normal\n I am lonely\n I am sorry for the cop\n I blow out my brains like bread out of the toaster\n My blood and bone are scattered around like elephants marching on watermelons.\n This is my sweet dream."}
