{"subject": "Sonnet 05", "text": "When hearts are full of yearning tenderness, \nFor the loved absent, whom we can not reach -- \nBy deed or token, gesture or kind speech, \nThe spirit's true affection to express; \nWhen hearts are full of innermost distress, \nAnd we are doomed to stand inactive by, \nWatching the soul's or body's agony, \nWhich human effort helps not to make less -- \nThen like a cup capacious to contain \nThe overflowings of the heart, is prayer: \nThe longing of the souls is satisfied, \nThe keenest darts of anguish blunted are; \nAnd, though we can not cease to yearn or grieve, \nYet we have learned in patience to abide."}
