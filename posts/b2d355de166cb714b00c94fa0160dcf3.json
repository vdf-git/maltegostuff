{"subject": "The Winged Soul", "text": "MY soul is like some cage-born bird, that hath\nA restless prescience\u2014howsoever won\u2014\nOf a broad pathway leading to the sun,\nWith promptings of an oft-reprov\u00e8d faith\nIn sun-ward yearnings. Stricken though her breast,\nAnd faint her wing with beating at the bars\nOf sense, she looks beyond outlying stars,\nAnd only in the Infinite sees rest.\n\nSad soul! If ever thy desire be bent\nOr broken to thy doom, and made to share\nThe ruminant's beatitude,\u2014content,\u2014\nChewing the cud of knowledge, with no care\nFor germs of life within; then will I say,\nThou art not caged, but fitly stalled in clay!"}
