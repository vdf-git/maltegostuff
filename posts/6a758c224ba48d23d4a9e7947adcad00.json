{"subject": "After Reading Trollope's History Of Florence", "text": "My books are on their shelves again\nAnd clouds lie low with mist and rain.\nAfar the Arno murmurs low\nThe tale of fields of melting snow.\nList to the bells of times agone\nThe while I wait me for the dawn.\n\nBeneath great Giotto's Campanile\nThe gray ghosts throng; their whispers steal\nFrom poets' bosoms long since dust;\nThey ask me now to go. I trust\nTheir fleeter footsteps where again\nThey come at night and live as men.\n\nThe rain falls on Ghiberti's gates;\nThe big drops hang on purple dates;\nAnd yet beneath the ilex-shades--\nDear trysting-place for boys and maids--\nThere comes a form from days of old,\nWith Beatrice's hair of gold.\n\nThe breath of lands or lilied streams\nFloats through the fabric of my dreams;\nAnd yonder from the hills of song,\nWhere psalmists brood and prophets throng,\nThe lone, majestic Dante leads\nHis love across the blooming meads.\n\nAlong the almond walks I tread\nAnd greet the figures of the dead.\nMirandula walks here with him\nWho lived with gods and seraphim;\nYet where Colonna's fair feet go\nThere passes Michael Angelo.\n\nIn Rome or Florence, still with her\nStands lone and grand her worshipper.\nIn Leonardo's brain there move\nChrist and the children of His love;\nAnd Raphael is touching now,\nFor the last time, an angel's brow.\n\nAngelico is praying yet\nWhere lives no pang of man's regret,\nAnd, mixing tears and prayers within\nHis palette's wealth, absolved from sin,\nHe dips his brush in hues divine;\nSan Marco's angel faces shine.\n\nWithin Lorenzo's garden green,\nWhere olives hide their boughs between,\nThe lovers, as they read betimes\nTheir love within Petrarca's lines,\nStand near the marbles found at Rome,\nLost shades that search in vain for home.\n\nThey pace the paths along the stream,\nDark Vallombrosa in their dream.\nThey sing, amidst the rain-drenched pines,\nOf Tuscan gold that ruddier shines\nBehind a saint's auroral face\nThat shows e'en yet the master's trace.\n\nBut lo, within the walls of gray,\nE're yet there falls a glint of day,\nAnd far without, from hill to vale,\nWhere honey-hearted nightingale\nOr meads of pale anemones\nMake sweet the coming morning breeze--\n\nI hear a voice, of prophet tone,\nA voice of doom, like his alone\nThat once in Gadara was heard;\nThe old walls trembled--lo, the bird\nHas ceased to sing, and yonder waits\nLorenzo at his palace gates.\n\nSome Romola in passing by\nTurns toward the ruler, and his sigh\nWanders amidst the myrtle bowers\nOr o'er the city's mantled towers,\nFor she is Florence! 'Wilt thou hear\nSan Marco's prophet? Doom is near.'\n\n'Her liberties,' he cries, 'restore!\nThis much for Florence--yea, and more\nTo men and God!' The days are gone;\nAnd in an hour of perfect dawn\nI stand beneath the cypress trees\nThat shiver still with words like these."}
