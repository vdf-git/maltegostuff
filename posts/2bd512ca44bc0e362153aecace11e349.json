I cry out: Iraq\nAnd from my cry a lament returns\nAn echo bursts forth\nI feel I have crossed the expanse \nTo a world of decay that responds not\nTo my cry\nIf I shake the branches\nOnly decay will drop from them\nStones\nStones-no fruit\nEven the springs \nAre stones, even the fresh breeze\nStones moistened with blood\nMy cry a stone, my mouth a rock\nMy legs a wind straying in the wastes"}
