{"subject": "Basket Of Figs", "text": "Bring me your pain, love. Spread \nit out like fine rugs, silk sashes, \nwarm eggs, cinnamon\nand cloves in burlap sacks. Show me\n\nthe detail, the intricate embroidery \non the collar, tiny shell buttons, \nthe hem stitched the way you were taught,\npricking just a thread, almost invisible.\n\nUnclasp it like jewels, the gold \nstill hot from your body. Empty \nyour basket of figs. Spill your wine.\n\nThat hard nugget of pain, I would suck it, \ncradling it on my tongue like the slick \nseed of pomegranate. I would lift it\n\ntenderly, as a great animal might \ncarry a small one in the private \ncave of the mouth."}
