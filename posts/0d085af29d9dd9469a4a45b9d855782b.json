{"subject": "Jealousy", "text": "The violets their soft, dark lashes part, \nWhile robins serenade them far and near ; \nBut the anemone, with ebon heart \nAnd blood-shot eyes, pretends she does not \nhear. \nThe violets invite the nightingale \nWhose carols fall in dew upon their bed ; \nBut the hydrangea, as saffron pale. \nHolds high above the wall her nodding; head."}
