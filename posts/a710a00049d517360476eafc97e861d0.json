{"subject": "The Convert's Love", "text": "Blessed Light of saints on high\nWho fill the mansions of the sky,\nSure defence, whose mercy still\nPreserves thy subjects here from ill,\nO my Jesus! make me know\nHow to pay the thanks I owe.\n\nAs the fond sheep that id'ly strays\nWith wanton play thro' winding ways,\nWhich never hits the road of home,\nO'er Wilds of danger learns to roam,\n'Till weari'd out with idle fear\nAnd passing there and turning here,\nHe will for rest to covert run\nAnd meet the wolf he wish'd to shun;\nThus wretched I, thro' wanton will\nRun blind and headlong on in ill:\n'Twas thus from sin to sin I flew\nAnd thus I might have perish'd too;\nBut mercy dropt the likeness here\nAnd shew'd and sav'd me from my fear;\nWhile o'er the darkness of my mind\nThe sacred spirit purely shin'd,\nAnd mark'd and bright'ned all the way\nWhich leads to everlasting day,\nAnd broke the thick'ning clouds of sin\nAnd fix'd the light of love within.\n\nFrom hence my ravish'd soul aspires\nAnd dates the rise of its desires.\nFrom hence to thee my God! I turn,\nAnd fervent wishes say I burn,\nI burn thy glorious face to see\nAnd live in endless joy with thee.\n\nThere's no such ardent kind of flame\nBetween the lover and the dame,\nNor such affection parents bear\nTo their young and only heir, \nTho' join'd together both conspire\nAnd boast a doubled force of fire.\nMy tender heart within its seat\nDissolves before the scorching heat,\nAs soft'ning wax is taught to run\nBefore the warmness of the sun.\n\nO my flame my pleasing pain\nBurn and purify my stain,\nWarm me, burn me, day by day\n'Till you purge my earth away,\n'Till at the last I throughly shine\nAnd turn a torch of love divine."}
