{"subject": "In School-Days", "text": "Still sits the school-house by the road, \nA ragged beggar sleeping; \nAround it still the sumachs grow, \nAnd blackberry-vines are creeping. \n\nWithin, the master's desk is seen, \nDeep-scarred by raps official; \nThe warping floor, the battered seats, \nThe jack-knife's carved initial; \n\nThe charcoal frescoes on its wall; \nIts door's worn sill, betraying \nThe feet that, creeping slow to school, \nWent storming out to playing! \n\nLong years ago a winter sun \nShone over it at setting; \nLit up its western window-panes, \nAnd low eaves' icy fretting. \n\nIt touched the tangled golden curls, \nAnd brown eyes full of grieving, \nOf one who still her steps delayed \nWhen all the school were leaving. \n\nFor near it stood the little boy \nHer childish favor singled; \nHis cap pulled low upon a face \nWhere pride and shame were mingled. \n\nPushing with restless feet the snow \nTo right and left, he lingered;--- \nAs restlessly her tiny hands \nThe blue-checked apron fingered. \n\nHe saw her lift her eyes; he felt \nThe soft hand's light caressing, \nAnd heard the tremble of her voice, \nAs if a fault confessing. \n\n\"I'm sorry that I spelt the word: \nI hate to go above you, \nBecause,\"---the brown eyes lower fell,--- \n\"Because, you see, I love you!\" \n\nStill memory to a gray-haired man \nThat sweet child-face is showing. \nDear girl! the grasses on her grave \nHave forty years been growing! \n\nHe lives to learn, in life's hard school, \nHow few who pass above him \nLament their triumph and his loss, \nLike her, because they love him."}
