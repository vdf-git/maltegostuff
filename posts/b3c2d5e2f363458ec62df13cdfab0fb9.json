{"subject": "Queens", "text": "Seven dog-days we let pass \nNaming Queens in Glenmacnass, \nAll the rare and royal names \nWormy sheepskin yet retains, \nEtain, Helen, Maeve, and Fand, \nGolden Deirdre's tender hand, \nBert, the big-foot, sung by Villon, \nCassandra, Ronsard found in Lyon. \nQueens of Sheba, Meath and Connaught, \nCoifed with crown, or gaudy bonnet, \nQueens whose finger once did stir men, \nQueens were eaten of fleas and vermin, \nQueens men drew like Monna Lisa, \nOr slew with drugs in Rome and Pisa, \nWe named Lucrezia Crivelli, \nAnd Titian's lady with amber belly, \nQueens acquainted in learned sin, \nJane of Jewry's slender shin: \nQueens who cut the bogs of Glanna, \nJudith of Scripture, and Gloriana, \nQueens who wasted the East by proxy, \nOr drove the ass-cart, a tinker's doxy, \nYet these are rotten - I ask their pardon - \nAnd we've the sun on rock and garden, \nThese are rotten, so you're the Queen \nOf all the living, or have been."}
