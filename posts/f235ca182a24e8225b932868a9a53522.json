{"subject": "Peace", "text": "There's good and bad in every race. \nThere's many shades to the human face. \nThere's only one kind of man I know. \nThe human kind with heart and soul. \nThere's a man under each shade of skin. \nThis fight on prejudice we hope to win. \nThere's a spirit dwelling inside each man. \nLook a little deeper and you'll understand. \nThat all we need is love and peace. \nThen the spirit of man will never cease."}
