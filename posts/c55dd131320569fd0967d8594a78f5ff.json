{"subject": "Fit The Eighth (Hunting Of The Snark )", "text": "The Vanishing \n\nThey sought it with thimbles, they sought it with care;\nThey pursued it with forks and hope; \nThey threatened its life with a railway-share; \nThey charmed it with smiles and soap. \nThey shuddered to think that the chase might fail, \nAnd the Beaver, excited at last, \nWent bounding along on the tip of its tail, \nFor the daylight was nearly past. \n\n\"There is Thingumbob shouting!\" the Bellman said. \n\"He is shouting like mad, only hark! \nHe is waving his hands, he is wagging his head, \nHe has certainly found a Snark!\" \n\nThey gazed in delight, while the Butcher exclaimed\n\"He was always a desperate wag!\" \nThey beheld him--their Baker--their hero unnamed--\nOn the top of a neighbouring crag, \n\nErect and sublime, for one moment of time, \nIn the next, that wild figure they saw\n(As if stung by a spasm) plunge into a chasm, \nWhile they waited and listened in awe. \n\n\"It's a Snark!\" was the sound that first came to their ears, \nAnd seemed almost too good to be true. \nThen followed a torrent of laughter and cheers: \nThen the ominous words \"It's a Boo--\" \n\nThen, silence. Some fancied they heard in the air\nA weary and wandering sigh\nThat sounded like \"--jum!\" but the others declare\nIt was only a breeze that went by. \n\nThey hunted till darkness came on, but they found\nNot a button, or feather, or mark, \nBy which they could tell that they stood on the ground\nWhere the Baker had met with the Snark. \n\nIn the midst of the word he was trying to say\nIn the midst of his laughter and glee, \nHe had softly and suddenly vanished away--\nFor the Snark was a Boojum, you see."}
