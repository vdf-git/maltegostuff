{"subject": "Not Heaving From My Ribb'D Breast Only", "text": "NOT heaving from my ribb'd breast only;\n   Not in sighs at night, in rage, dissatisfied with myself;\n   Not in those long-drawn, ill-supprest sighs;\n   Not in many an oath and promise broken;\n   Not in my wilful and savage soul's volition;\n   Not in the subtle nourishment of the air;\n   Not in this beating and pounding at my temples and wrists;\n   Not in the curious systole and diastole within, which will one day\n         cease;\n   Not in many a hungry wish, told to the skies only;\n   Not in cries, laughter, defiances, thrown from me when alone, far in\n         the wilds;                                                   10\n   Not in husky pantings through clench'd teeth;\n   Not in sounded and resounded words--chattering words, echoes, dead\n         words;\n   Not in the murmurs of my dreams while I sleep,\n   Nor the other murmurs of these incredible dreams of every day;\n   Nor in the limbs and senses of my body, that take you and dismiss you\n         continually--Not there;\n   Not in any or all of them, O adhesiveness! O pulse of my life!\n   Need I that you exist and show yourself, any more than in these\n         songs."}
