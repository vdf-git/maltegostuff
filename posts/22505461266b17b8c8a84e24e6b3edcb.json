{"subject": "Solitude", "text": "How still it is here in the woods. The trees\nStand motionless, as if they did not dare\nTo stir, lest it should break the spell. The air\nHangs quiet as spaces in a marble frieze.\nEven this little brook, that runs at ease,\nWhispering and gurgling in its knotted bed,\nSeems but to deepen with its curling thread\nOf sound the shadowy sun-pierced silences.\n\nSometimes a hawk screams or a woodpecker\nStartles the stillness from its fixed mood\nWith his loud careless tap. Sometimes I hear\nThe dreamy white-throat from some far-off tree\nPipe slowly on the listening solitude\nHis five pure notes succeeding pensively."}
