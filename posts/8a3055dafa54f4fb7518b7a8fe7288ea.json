{"subject": "On Waking From A Dreamless Sleep", "text": "I WAKED; the sun was in the sky,\nThe face of heaven was fair;\nThe silence all about me lay,\nOf morning in the air.\n\nI said, Where hast thou been, my soul,\nSince the moon set in the west?\nI know not where thy feet have trod,\nNor what has been thy quest.\n\nWhere wast thou when Orion past\nBelow the dark-blue sea?\nHis glittering, silent stars are gone,\nDidst follow them for me?\n\nWhere wast thou in that awful hour\nWhen first the night-wind heard\nThe faint breath of the coming dawn,\nAnd fled before the word?\n\nWhere hast thou been, my spirit,\nSince the long wave on the shore\nTenderly rocked my sense asleep\nAnd I heard thee no more?\n\nMy limbs like breathing marble\nHave lain in the warm down;\nNo heavenly chant, no earthly care,\nHave stirred a smile or frown.\n\nI wake; thy kiss is on my lips;\nThou art my day, my sun!\nBut where, O spirit, where wast thou\nWhile the sands of night have run?"}
