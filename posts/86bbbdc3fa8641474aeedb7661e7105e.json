{"subject": "Epigram : To Leonora Singing At Rome 2 (Translated From Milton)", "text": "Naples, too credulous, ah! boast no more\nThe sweet-voiced Siren buried on thy shore,\nThat, when Parthenope deceas'd, she gave\nHer sacred dust to a Chalcidic grave,\nFor still she lives, but has exchanged the hoarse\nPausilipo for Tiber's placid course,\nWhere, idol of all Rome, she now in chains,\nOf magic song both Gods and Men detains."}
