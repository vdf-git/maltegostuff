{"subject": "Sonnet Vi", "text": "I CANNOT face the utterance of a prayer \nIn innocence; I know not by what gate \nEgress it finds beyond the fields of air; \nIn what vain corridor my words may wait. \nA mystic once, I did communicate \nWith my own self and thought with God to share \nMy hope and aspiration; but of late \nMy words, like Noah's dove, returning bare, \nI feel the confines of my spirit's heaven. \nAgainst the limits of myself in vain \nThey strike and bruise their wings and downward fall. \nThen to myself, Peace! do I cry, and call \nThat sufferance peace which yet is perfect pain: \nIn courage, Peace! when there is no peace given."}
