{"subject": "My Blue Fairy", "text": "If I could ever see tomorrow\nAnd tell you about our future\nYou would be the moon of my life\nAnd we would share a place amongst stars\n\nIf destiny wouldn't tear us apart\nAnd if dreams could ever come true\nIf my life could be as transparent, \nAs your eyes, reflecting an innocent glow.\n\nIf love could be a synonym for religion, \nAnd wisdom could replace materialism.\nThen under the crescent moonlit sky, \nOur life would be sweet like honey and sugar.\n\nYour presence means a lot to me.\nYour laughter fills up the entire void\nAnd with you around none of the things matter\nAs world starts and ends with your smile\n\nYou are so different like some blue fairy\nGiving a meaning to this life of mine, \nBy keeping my soul locked in your soft palms, \nCuddling my heart with your satin wings."}
