{"subject": "O Wind That Blows Out Of The West", "text": "O wind that blows out of the West,\nThou hast swept over mountain and sea,\nDost thou bear on thy swift, glad wings\nThe breath of my love to me?\nHast thou kissed her warm, sweet lips?\nOr tangled her soft, brown hair?\nOr fluttered the fragrant heart\nOf the rose she loves to wear?\n\nO sun that goes down in the West,\nHast thou seen my love to-day,\nAs she sits in her beautiful prime\nUnder skies so far away?\nHast thou gilded a path for her feet,\nOr deepened the glow on her cheeks,\nOr bent from the skies to hear\nThe low, sweet words she speaks?\n\nO stars that are bright in the West\nWhen the hush of the night is deep,\nDo ye see my love as she lies\nLike a chaste, white flower asleep?\nDoes she smile as she walks with me\nIn the light of a happy dream,\nWhile the night winds rustle the leaves,\nAnd the light waves ripple and gleam?\n\nO birds that fly out of the West,\nDo ye bring me a message from her,\nAs sweet as your love-notes are,\nWhen the warm spring breezes stir?\nDid she whisper a word of me\nAs your tremulous wings swept by,\nOr utter my name, mayhap,\nIn a single passionate cry?\n\nO voices out of the West,\nYe are silent every one,\nAnd never an answer comes\nFrom wind, or stars, or sun!\nAnd the blithe birds come and go\nThrough the boundless fields of space,\nAs reckless of human prayers\nAs if earth were a desert place!"}
