{"subject": "Rio Grande's Last Race", "text": "Now this was what Macpherson told \nWhile waiting in the stand; \nA reckless rider, over-bold, \nThe only man with hands to hold \nThe rushing Rio Grande. \n\nHe said, 'This day I bid good-bye \nTo bit and bridle rein, \nTo ditches deep and fences high, \nFor I have dreamed a dream, and I \nShall never ride again. \n\n'I dreamt last night I rode this race \nThat I to-day must ride, \nAnd cant'ring down to take my place \nI saw full many an old friend's face \nCome stealing to my side. \n\n'Dead men on horses long since dead, \nThey clustered on the track; \nThe champions of the days long fled, \nThey moved around with noiseless tread - \nBay, chestnut, brown, and black. \n\n'And one man on a big grey steed \nRode up and waved his hand; \nSaid he, \"We help a friend in need, \nAnd we have come to give a lead \nTo you and Rio Grande. \n\n'\"For you must give the field the slip, \nSo never draw the rein, \nBut keep him moving with the whip, \nAnd if he falter - set your lip \nAnd rouse him up again. \n\n'\"But when you reach the big stone wall, \nPut down your bridle hand \nAnd let him sail - he cannot fall - \nBut don't you interfere at all; \nYou trust old Rio Grande.\" \n\n'We started, and in front we showed, \nThe big horse running free: \nRight fearlessly and game he strode, \nAnd by my side those dead men rode \nWhom no one else could see. \n\n'As silently as flies a bird, \nThey rode on either hand; \nAt every fence I plainly heard \nThe phantom leader give the word, \n\"Make room for Rio Grande!\" \n\n'I spurred him on to get the lead, \nI chanced full many a fall; \nBut swifter still each phantom steed \nKept with me, and at racing speed \nWe reached the big stone wall. \n\n'And there the phantoms on each side \nDrew in and blocked his leap; \n\"Make room! make room!\" I loudly cried, \nBut right in front they seemed to ride - \nI cursed them in my sleep. 'He never flinched, he faced it game, \nHe struck it with his chest, \nAnd every stone burst out in flame, \nAnd Rio Grande and I became \nAs phantoms with the rest. \n\n'And then I woke, and for a space \nAll nerveless did I seem; \nFor I have ridden many a race, \nBut never one at such a pace \nAs in that fearful dream. \n\n'And I am sure as man can be \nThat out upon the track, \nThose phantoms that men cannot see \nAre waiting now to ride with me, \nAnd I shall not come back. \n\n'For I must ride the dead men's race, \nAnd follow their command; \n'Twere worse than death, the foul disgrace \nIf I should fear to take my place \nTo-day on Rio Grande.' \n\nHe mounted, and a jest he threw, \nWith never sign of gloom; \nBut all who heard the story knew \nThat Jack Macpherson, brave and true, \nWas going to his doom. \n\nThey started, and the big black steed \nCame flashing past the stand; \nAll single-handed in the lead \nHe strode along at racing speed, \nThe mighty Rio Grande. \n\nBut on his ribs the whalebone stung, \nA madness it did seem! \nAnd soon it rose on every tongue \nThat Jack Macpherson rode among \nThe creatures of his dream. \n\nHe looked to left and looked to right, \nAs though men rode beside; \nAnd Rio Grande, with foam-flecks white, \nRaced at his jumps in headlong flight \nAnd cleared them in his stride. \n\nBut when they reached the big stone wall, \nDown went the bridle-hand, \nAnd loud we heard Macpherson call, \n'Make room, or half the field will fall! \nMake room for Rio Grande!' \n\n. . . . . \n\n'He's down! he's down!' And horse and man \nLay quiet side by side! \nNo need the pallid face to scan, \nWe knew with Rio Grande he ran \nThe race the dead men ride. \n\nA.B. (Banjo) Paterson"}
