{"subject": "The Prayer Of Agassiz", "text": "On the isle of Penikese,\nRinged about by sapphire seas,\nFanned by breezes salt and cool,\nStood the Master with his school.\nOver sails that not in vain\nWooed the west-wind's steady strain,\nLine of coast that low and far\nStretched its undulating bar,\nWings aslant along the rim\nOf the waves they stooped to skim,\nRock and isle and glistening bay,\nFell the beautiful white day.\n\nSaid the Master to the youth\n'We have come in search of truth,\nTrying with uncertain key\nDoor by door of mystery;\nWe are reaching, through His laws,\nTo the garment-hem of Cause,\nHim, the endless, unbegun,\nThe Unnamable, the One\nLight of all our light the Source,\nLife of life, and Force of force.\nAs with fingers of the blind,\nWe are groping here to find\nWhat the hieroglyphics mean\nOf the Unseen in the seen,\nWhat the Thought which underlies\nNature's masking and disguise,\nWhat it is that hides beneath\nBlight and bloom and birth and death.\nBy past efforts unavailing,\nDoubt and error, loss and failing,\nOf our weakness made aware,\nOn the threshold of our task\nLet us light and guidance ask,\nLet us pause in silent prayer!'\n\nThen the Master in his place\nBowed his head a little space,\nAnd the leaves by soft airs stirred,\nLapse of wave and cry of bird,\nLeft the solemn hush unbroken\nOf that wordless prayer unspoken,\nWhile its wish, on earth unsaid,\nRose to heaven interpreted.\nAs, in life's best hours, we hear\nBy the spirit's finer ear\nHis low voice within us, thus\nThe All-Father heareth us;\nAnd His holy ear we pain\nWith our noisy words and vain.\nNot for Him our violence\nStorming at the gates of sense,\nHis the primal language, His\nThe eternal silences!\n\nEven the careless heart was moved,\nAnd the doubting gave assent,\nWith a gesture reverent,\nTo the Master well-beloved.\nAs thin mists are glorified\nBy the light they cannot hide,\nAll who gazed upon him saw,\nThrough its veil of tender awe,\nHow his face was still uplit\nBy the old sweet look of it.\nHopeful, trustful, full of cheer,\nAnd the love that casts out fear.\nWho the secret may declare\nOf that brief, unuttered prayer?\nDid the shade before him come\nOf th' inevitable doom,\nOf the end of earth so near,\nAnd Eternity's new year?\n\nIn the lap of sheltering seas\nRests the isle of Penikese;\nBut the lord of the domain\nComes not to his own again\nWhere the eyes that follow fail,\nOn a vaster sea his sail\nDrifts beyond our beck and hail.\nOther lips within its bound\nShall the laws of life expound;\nOther eyes from rock and shell\nRead the world's old riddles well\nBut when breezes light and bland\nBlow from Summer's blossomed land,\nWhen the air is glad with wings,\nAnd the blithe song-sparrow sings,\nMany an eye with his still face\nShall the living ones displace,\nMany an ear the word shall seek\nHe alone could fitly speak.\nAnd one name forevermore\nShall be uttered o'er and o'er\nBy the waves that kiss the shore,\nBy the curlew's whistle sent\nDown the cool, sea-scented air;\nIn all voices known to her,\nNature owns her worshipper,\nHalf in triumph, half lament.\nThither Love shall tearful turn,\nFriendship pause uncovered there,\nAnd the wisest reverence learn\nFrom the Master's silent prayer."}
