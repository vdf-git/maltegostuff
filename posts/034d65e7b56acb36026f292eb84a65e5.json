{"subject": "The Night Before The Mowing", "text": "ALL shimmering in the morning shine \nAnd diamonded with dew, \nAnd quivering in the scented wind \nThat thrills its green heart through,-- \nThe little field, the smiling field, \nWith all its flowers a-blowing, \nHow happy looks the golden field \nThe day before the mowing! \n\nAll still 'neath the departing light, \nTwilight, though void of stars, \nSave where, low westering, Venus hides \nFrom the red eye of Mars; \nHow quiet lies the silent field \nWith all its beauties glowing; \nJust stirring,--like a child asleep,-- \nThe night before the mowing. \nSharp steel, inevitable hand, \nCut keen, cut kind! Our field \nWe know full well must be laid low \nBefore its wealth it yield: \nLabor and mirth and plenty blest \nIts blameless death bestowing: \nAnd yet we weep, and yet we weep, \nThe night before the mowing."}
