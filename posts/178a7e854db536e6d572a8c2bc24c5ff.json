{"subject": "Wat Tyler - Act Ii", "text": "ACT II. \n\nSCENE\u2014 BLACKHEATH. \nTYLER, HOB, &amp;c. \n\nSONG. \n\n' When Adam delv'd, and Eve span, \n' Who was then the gentleman?' \n\nWretched is the infant's lot, \nBorn within the straw-roof'd cot! \nBe he generous, wise, or brave, \nHe must only be a slave. \nLong, long labour, little rest, \nStill to toil to be oppress'd; \nDrain'd by taxes of his store, \nPunish'd next for being poor; \nThis is the poor wretch's lot, \nBorn within the straw-roof'd cot. \n\nWhile the peasant works\u2014 to sleep; \nWhat the peasant sows\u2014 to reap; \nOn the couch of ease to lie, \nRioting in revelry; \nBe he villain, be he fool, \nStill to hold despotic rule, \nTrampling on his slaves with scorn; \nThis is to be nobly born. \n\n' When Adam delv'd, and Eve span, \n' Who was then the gentleman?' \nJACK STRAW. \n\nThe mob are up in London\u2014 the proud courtiers \nBegin to tremble. \nTOM MILLER. \n\nAye, aye, 'tis time to tremble; \nWho'll plow their fields, who'll do their drudgery now? \nAnd work like horses, to give them the harvest? \nJACK STRAW. \n\nI only wonder we lay quiet so long. \nWe had always the same strength, and we deserved \nThe ills we met with for not using it. \nHOB. \n\nWhy do we fear those animals called lords? \nWhat is there in the name to frighten us? \nIs not my arm as mighty as a Baron's? \nEnter PIERS and JOHN BALL. \n\nPIERS (to TYLER). \n\nHave I done well, my father?\u2014 I remember'd \nThis good man lay in prison. \nTYLER. \n\nMy dear child, \nMost well; the people rise for liberty, \nAnd their first deed should be to break the chains \nThat bind the virtuous:\u2014 O thou honest priest\u2014 \nHow much has thou endured! \nJOHN BALL. \n\nWhy aye, my friend! \nThese squalid rags bespeak what I have suffered. \nI was revil'd\u2014 insulted\u2014 left to languish \nIn a damp dungeon; but I bore it cheerily\u2014 \nMy heart was glad\u2014 for I have done my duty. \nI pitied my oppressors, and I sorrowed \nFor the poor men of England. \nTYLER. \n\nThey have felt \nTheir strength\u2014look round this heath! 'tis thronged with men. \nArdent for freedom; mighty is the event \nThat waits their fortune. \nJOHN BALL. \n\nI would fain address them. \nTYLER. \n\nDo so, my friend, and teach to them their duty; \nRemind them of their long withholden rights. \nWhat ho there! silence! \nPIERS. \n\nSilence there, my friends, \nThis good man would address you. \nHOB. \n\nAye, aye, hear him\u2014 \nHe is no mealy mouthed court orator, \nTo flatter vice, and pamper lordly pride. \nJOHN BALL. \n\nFriends! Brethren! for ye are my brethren all; \nEnglishmen met in arms to advocate \nThe cause of freedom! hear me! pause awhile \nIn the career of vengeance; it is true \nI am a priest; but, as these rags may speak, \nNot one who riots in the poor man's spoil, \nOr trades with his religion. I am one \nWho preach the law of Christ, and in my life, \nWould practice what he taught. The son of God \nCame not to you in power: humble in mien, \nLowly in heart, the man of Nazareth \nPreach'd mercy, justice, love: 'Woe unto ye, \nYe that are rich:\u2014if that ye would be saved, \nSell that ye have, and give unto the poor.' \nSo taught the Saviour: oh, my honest friends! \nHave ye not felt the strong indignant throb \nOf justice in your bosoms, to behold \nThe lordly Baron feasting on your spoils? \nHave you not in your hearts arraign'd the lot \nThat gave him on the couch of luxury \nTo pillow his head, and pass the festive day \nIn sportive feasts, and ease, and revelry? \nHave you not often in your conscience ask'd \nWhy is the difference, wherefore should that man, \nNo worthier than myself, thus lord it over me, \nAnd bid me labour, and enjoy the fruits? \nThe God within your breasts has argued thus! \nThe voice of truth has murmur'd; came ye not \nAs helpless to the world? Shines not the sun \nWith equal ray on both?\u2014 Do ye not feel \nThe self same winds of heaven as keenly parch ye? \nAbundant is the earth\u2014the Sire of all, \nSaw and pronounc'd that it was very good. \nLook round: the vernal fields smile with new flowers, \nThe budding orchard perfumes the soft breeze, \nAnd the green corn waves to the passing gale. \nThere is enough for all, but your proud Baron \nStands up, and arrogant of strength exclaims, \n'I am a Lord\u2014by nature I am noble: \nThese fields are mine, for I was born to them, \nI was born in the castle\u2014you, poor wretches, \nWhelp'd in the cottage, are by birth my slaves.' \nAlmighty God! such blasphemies are utter'd! \nAlmighty God! such blasphemies believ'd! \nTOM MILLER. \n\nThis is something like a sermon. \nJACK STRAW. \n\nWhere's the bishop \nWould tell you truths like these? \nHOB. \n\nThere was never a bishop among all the apostles. \nJOHN BALL. \n\nMy brethren! \nPIERS. \n\nSilence, the good priest speaks. \nJOHN BALL. \n\nMy brethren, these are truths, and weighty ones: \nYe are all equal: nature made ye so. \nEquality is your birth-right;\u2014when I gaze \nOn the proud palace, and behold one man \nIn the blood-purpled robes of royalty, \nFeasting at ease, and lording over millions, \nThen turn me to the hut of poverty, \nAnd see the wretched lab'rer worn with toil, \nDivide his scanty morsel with his infants, \nI sicken, and indignant at the sight, \n' Blush for the patience of humanity.' \nJACK STRAW. \n\nWe will assert our rights. \nTOM MILLER. \n\nWe'll trample down \nThese insolent oppressors. \nJOHN BALL. \n\nIn good truth \nYe have cause for anger: but, my honest friends, \nIs it revenge or justice that ye seek? \nMOB. \n\nJustice, justice! \nJOHN BALL. \n\nOh then remember mercy; \nAnd though your proud oppressors spar'd not you, \nShew you excel them in humanity. \nThey will use every art to disunite you, \nTo conquer separately, by stratagem, \nWhom in a mass they fear\u2014 but be ye firm\u2014 \nBoldly demand your long-forgotten rights, \nYour sacred, your inalienable freedom\u2014 \nBe bold\u2014be resolute\u2014be merciful! \nAnd while you spurn the hated name of slaves, \nShew you are men! \nMOB. \n\nLong live our honest priest! \nJACK STRAW. \n\nHe shall be made archbishop. \nJOHN BALL. \n\nMy brethren, I am plain John Ball, your friend, \nYour equal: by the law of Christ enjoined \nTo serve you, not command. \nJACK STRAW. \n\nMarch we for London. \nTYLER. \n\nMark me, my friends\u2014we rise for liberty\u2014 \nJustice shall be our guide: let no man dare \nTo plunder in the tumult. \nMOB \n\nLead us on\u2014 \nLiberty!\u2014Justice! \n(Exeunt, with cries of Liberty\u2014 no Poll Tax \u2014 no War.) \n\nSCENE CHANGES TO THE TOWER. \n\nKING RICHARD, ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY, \nSIR JOHN TRESILIAN, \nWALWORTH, PHILPOT. \nKING \n\nWhat must we do? the danger grows more imminent\u2014 \nThe mob increases\u2014 \nPHILPOT. \n\nEvery moment brings \nFresh tidings of our peril. \nKING. \n\nIt were well \nTo yield them what they ask. \nARCHBISHOP. \n\nAye, that my liege \nWere politic. Go boldly forth to meet them, \nGrant all they ask\u2014however wild and ruinous\u2014 \nMean time the troops you have already summoned, \nWill gather round them. Then my Christian power \nAbsolves you of your promise. \nWALWORTH. \n\nWere but their ringleaders cut off\u2014the rabble \nWould soon disperse. \nPHILPOT. \n\nUnited in a mass \nThere's nothing can resist them\u2014once divide them, \nAnd they will fall an easy sacrifice. \nARCHBISHOP. \n\nLull them by promises\u2014bespeak them fair\u2014 \nGo forth, my liege\u2014spare not, if need requires, \nA solemn oath, to ratify the treaty. \nKING \n\nI dread their fury. \nARCHBISHOP. \n\n'Tis a needless dread, \nThere is divinity about your person; \nIt is the sacred privilege of Kings, \nHowe'er they act, to render no account \nTo man. The people have been taught this lesson, \nNor can they soon forget it. \nKING. \n\nI will go\u2014 \nI will submit to everything they ask; \nMy day of triumph will arrive at last. \n(Shouts without.) \n\nEnter Messenger. \nMESSENGER. \n\nThe mob are at the city gates. \nARCHBISHOP. \n\nHaste, haste, \nAddress them ere too late. I'll remain here, \nFor they detest me much. \n(Shouts again. ) \n\nEnter another Messenger. \nMESSENGER. \n\nThe Londoners have opened the city gates, \nThe rebels are admitted. \nKING. \n\nFear then must give me courage; my Lord Mayor, \nCome you with me. \n(Exeunt. Shouts without.) \n\nSCENE\u2014 SMITHFIELD. \n\nWAT TYLER, JOHN BALL, PIERS, &amp;c. Mob. \nPIERS. \n\nSo far triumphant are we: how these nobles, \nThese petty tyrants, who so long oppress'd us, \nShrink at the first resistance! \nHOB. \n\nThey were powerful \nOnly because we fondly thought them so. \nWhere is Jack Straw? \nTYLER. \n\nJack Straw is gone to the tower \nTo seize the king, and so to end resistance. \nJOHN BALL. \n\nIt was well judg'd: fain would I spare the shedding \nOf human blood: gain we that royal puppet, \nAnd all will follow fairly: depriv'd of him, \nThe nobles lose their pretext, nor will dare \nRebel against the people's majesty. \nEnter Herald. \nHERALD. \n\nRichard the Second, by the grace of God, \nOf England, Ireland, France, and Scotland, King, \nAnd of the town of Berwick upon Tweed, \nWould parley with Wat Tyler. \nTYLER. \n\nLet him know \nWat Tyler is in Smithfield. \n(Exit Herald.) \n\nI will parley \nWith this young monarch; as he comes to me \nTrusting my honour, on your lives I charge you \nLet none attempt to harm him. \nJOHN BALL \n\nThe faith of courts \nIs but a weak dependence! You are honest\u2014 \nAnd better is it even to die the victim \nOf credulous honesty, than live preserved \nBy the cold policy that still suspects. \nEnter KING, WALWORTH, PHILPOT, &amp;c. \nKING. \n\nI would speak to thee, Wat Tyler: bid the mob \nRetire awhile. \nPIERS. \n\nNay, do not go alone\u2014 \nLet me attend you. \nTYLER. \n\nWherefore should I fear? \nAm I not arm'd with a just cause?\u2014retire, \nAnd I will boldly plead the cause of Freedom. \n(Advances.) \n\nKING. \n\nTyler, why have you kill'd my officer? \nAnd led my honest subjects from their homes, \nThus to rebel against the Lord's anointed? \nTYLER. \n\nBecause they were oppress'd. \nKING. \n\nWas this the way \nTo remedy the ill?\u2014 you should have tried \nBy milder means\u2014petition'd at the throne\u2014 \nThe throne will always listen to petitions. \nTYLER. \n\nKing of England, \nPetitioning for pity is most weak, \nThe sovereign people ought to demand justice. \nI kill'd your officer, for his lewd hand \nInsulted a maid's modesty: your subjects \nI lead to rebel against the Lord's anointed, \nBecause his ministers have made him odious: \nHis yoke is heavy, and his burden grievous. \nWhy do we carry on this fatal war, \nTo force upon the French a king they hate; \nTearing our young men from their peaceful homes; \nForcing his hard-earn'd fruits from the honest peasant; \nDistressing us to desolate our neighbours? \nWhy is this ruinous poll tax imposed, \nBut to support your court's extravagance, \nAnd your mad title to the crown of France? \nShall we sit tamely down beneath these evils \nPetitioning for pity? \nKing of England! \nWhy are we sold like cattle in your markets\u2014 \nDeprived of every privilege of man? \nMust we lie tamely at our tyrant's feet, \nAnd, like your spaniels, lick the hand that beats us? \nYou sit at ease in your gay palaces, \nThe costly banquet courts your appetite, \nSweet music sooths your slumbers; we the while, \nScarce by hard toil can earn a little food, \nAnd sleep scarce shelter'd from the cold night wind: \nWhilst your wild projects wrest the little from us \nWhich might have cheer'd the wintry hour of age: \nThe Parliament for ever asks more money: \nWe toil and sweat for money for your taxes: \nWhere is the benefit, what food reap we \nFrom all the councils of your government? \nThink you that we should quarrel with the French? \nWhat boots to us your victories, your glory? \nWe pay, we fight, you profit at your ease. \nDo you not claim the country as your own? \nDo you not call the venison of the forest, \nThe birds of heaven your own?\u2014prohibiting us, \nEven tho' in want of food, to seize the prey \nWhich nature offers?\u2014King! is all this just? \nThink you we do not feel the wrongs we suffer? \nThe hour of retribution is at hand, \nAnd tyrants tremble\u2014mark me, King of England. \nWALWORTH. \n\n(Comes behind him, and stabs him.) \n\nInsolent rebel, threatening the King! \nPIERS. \n\nVengeance! vengeance! \nHOB. \n\nSeize the King. \nKING. \n\nI must be bold. (Advancing.) \nMy friends and loving subjects, \nI will grant all you ask: you shall be free\u2014 \nThe tax shall be repeal'd\u2014 all, all you wish. \nYour leader menaced me, he deserv'd his fate. \nQuiet your angers; on my royal word \nYour grievances shall all be done away. \nYour vassalage abolish'd.\u2014A free pardon \nAllow'd to all: so help me God it shall be. \nJOHN BALL. \n\nRevenge, my brethren, beseems not Christians. \nSend us these terms sign'd with your seal of state. \nWe will await in peace: deceive us not.\u2014 \nAct justly, so to excuse your late foul deed. \nKING. \n\nThe charter shall be drawn out: on mine honour, \nAll shall be justly done. \nEND OF ACT THE SECOND."}
