{"subject": "In A Dark Time", "text": "In a dark time, the eye begins to see, \nI meet my shadow in the deepening shade; \nI hear my echo in the echoing wood-- \nA lord of nature weeping to a tree. \nI live between the heron and the wren, \nBeasts of the hill and serpents of the den. \nWhat's madness but nobility of soul \nAt odds with circumstance? The day's on fire! \nI know the purity of pure despair, \nMy shadow pinned against a sweating wall. \nThat place among the rocks--is it a cave, \nOr a winding path? The edge is what I have. \n\nA steady storm of correspondences! \nA night flowing with birds, a ragged moon, \nAnd in broad day the midnight come again! \nA man goes far to find out what he is-- \nDeath of the self in a long, tearless night, \nAll natural shapes blazing unnatural light. \n\nDark, dark my light, and darker my desire. \nMy soul, like some heat-maddened summer fly, \nKeeps buzzing at the sill. Which I is I? \nA fallen man, I climb out of my fear. \nThe mind enters itself, and God the mind, \nAnd one is One, free in the tearing wind."}
