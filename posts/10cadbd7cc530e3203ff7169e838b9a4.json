{"subject": "A Hymn For Noon", "text": "The sun is swiftly mounted high; \nIt glitters in the southern sky; \nIts beams with force and glory beat, \nAnd fruitful earth is fill'd with heat. \nFather, also with Thy fire \nWarm the cold, the dead desire, \nAnd make the sacred love of Thee \nWithin my soul a sun to me. \nLet it shine so fairly bright \nThat nothing else be took for light, \nThat worldly charms be seen to fade, \nAnd in its lustre find a shade. \nLet it strongly shine within \nTo scatter all the clouds of sin, \nThat drive when gusts of passion rise \nAnd intercept it from our eyes. \nLet its glory more than vie \nWith the sun that lights the sky; \nLet it swiftly mount in air, \nMount with that, and leave it there,\nAnd soar with more aspiring flight \nTo realms of everlasting light. \nThus, while here I'm forc'd to be, \nI daily wish to live with Thee, \nAnd feel that union which Thy love \nWill, after death, complete above. \nFrom my soul I send my prayer; \nGreat creator, bow Thine ear; \nThou for whose propitious sway \nThe world was taught to see the day, \nWho spake the word and earth begun \nAnd show'd its beauties in the sun; \nWith pleasure I Thy creatures view, \nAnd would with good affection, too, \nGood affection sweetly free, \nLoose from them and move to Thee; \nO teach me due returns to give, \nAnd to Thy glory let me live, \nAnd then my days shall shine the more \nOr pass more blessed than before."}
