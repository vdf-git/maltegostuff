{"subject": "Serene", "text": "THIS crystal sapphire of the sky \nIs saner far than you and I, \nWho in our passions and our dreams \nRun evermore to wild extremes. \n\nThe pure perfection of the sea \nLies not in mirth and tragedy; \nBut like the silence of the snows \nIn breadth of beauty and repose. \n\nGod give one moment, ere we die, \nAs crystal clear as the blue sky, \nSerene as ocean, white as snow, \nAnd glowing as the heavens glow."}
