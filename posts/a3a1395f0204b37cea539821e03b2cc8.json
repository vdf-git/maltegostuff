{"subject": "from Deaf Republic: 14", "text": "Each man has a quiet that revolves\naround him as he beats his head against the earth. But I am laughing\n\nhard and furious. I pour a glass of pepper vodka\nand toast the gray wall. I say we were\n\nnever silent. We read each other's lips and said\none word four times. And laughed four times\n\nin loving repetition. We read each other's lips to uncover\nthe poverty of laughter. Touch the asphalt with fingers to hear the cool earth of Vasenka\n\nDeposit ears into the raindrops on a fisherman's tobacco hair.\nAnd whoever listens to me: being\n\nthere, and not being, lost and found\nand lost again: Thank you for the feather on my tongue,\n\nthank you for our argument that ends,\nthank you for my deafness, Lord, such fire\n\nfrom a match you never lit."}
