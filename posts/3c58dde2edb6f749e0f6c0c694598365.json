{"subject": "For The Briar-Rose", "text": "The Briarwood.\n\nThe fateful slumber floats and flows\nAbout the tangle of the rose;\nBut lo! the fated hand and heart\nTo rend the slumberous curse apart!\n\nThe Council Room.\n\nThe threat of war, the hope of peace,\nThe Kingdom\u2019s peril and increase\nSleep on, and bide the latter day,\nWhen fate shall take her chain away.\n\nThe Garden Court.\n\nThe maiden pleasance of the land\nKnoweth no stir of voice or hand,\nNo cup the sleeping waters fill,\nThe restless shuttle lieth still.\n\nThe Rosebower.\n\nHere lies the hoarded love, the key\nTo all the treasure that shall be;\nCome fated hand the gift to take,\nAnd smite this sleeping world awake."}
