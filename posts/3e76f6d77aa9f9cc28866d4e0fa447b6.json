{"subject": "If I Might Choose", "text": "If I might choose, where my tired limbs shall lie\nWhen my task here is done, the Oak's green crest\nShall rise above my grave--a little mound\nRaised in some cheerful village--cemetery--\nAnd I could wish, that, with unceasing sound\nA lonely mountain rill was murmuring by--\nIn music--through the long soft twilight hours;--\nAnd let the hand of her, whom I love best,\nPlant round the bright green grave those fragrant flowers,\nIn whose deep bells the wild--bee loves to rest--\nAnd should the robin, from some neighbouring tree,\nPour his enchanted song--oh, softly tread,\nFor sure, if aught of earth can soothe the dead,\nHe still must love that pensive melody!"}
