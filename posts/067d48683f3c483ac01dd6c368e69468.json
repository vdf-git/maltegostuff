{"subject": "Vicissitude A Blessing", "text": "There's good in all the various changes\nThat man's mortality befall;\nAnd wheresoe'er the spirit ranges,\nDeath, great reformer! levels all:\nThe pomp that lifts its horn so proudly,\nThe wealth that sits with scorn on high,\nThe eloquence that talks so loudly,\nDeath's storm sweeps off, and passes by.\nThere's good in all-and death, that seemeth\nGreatest of mysteries, beams with good:\nUnwisely of his God he deemeth,\nWho, in the mixed vicissitude\nOf earthly joys and earthly sorrows,\nNo all-directing influence sees;\nFor heaven-excited wisdom borrows\nComfort from all life's mysteries."}
