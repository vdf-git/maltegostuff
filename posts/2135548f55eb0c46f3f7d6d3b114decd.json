{"subject": "Crimson Bird", "text": "Feet that tear at granite rocks \nOf life's uneven shoals... \nTearing feet shed tears of blood \nAnd, shedding, blood with the salt flood \nMixes. \nYet so vast are your own waters, \nYour teeming salt solution, \nThat in them my blood's mere dilution. Nameless in that unmeasured flow, \nSuch blood is what you'll never know. While wild and sharp and fuming and ablaze \nThis crimson, overflowing bird of mine soars away."}
