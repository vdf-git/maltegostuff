{"subject": "The Happy Flatite", "text": "We were living in a flat; it was number eighty-three.\nAt eighty-four the Barleys lived, a fearsome man was he.\nHe had a wife and numerous kids. We heard then rip and cuss,\nSome three feet and a quarter off, across the hall from us.\n\nAnd when the Barley boys broke out, and ended up in fight,\nOr when the Barley baby read the Riot Act at night,\nAnd on their balcony their cat put up an eerie moan,\nThe fearful Barley family might as well have been our own.\n\nWhen Barley after parting with some others of the ilk\nCame panting up the narrow stairs, and drank our jug of milk,\nThen broke out at his missus, and as fiercely answered she \u2013\nWhere was the great advantage of our marked sobriety?\n\nWhen Barley bedded early he would shake the common floor\nAnd fill the gulf of night with an intolerable snore,\nAnd people in the other wing at us their bluchers threw \u2013\nWhat good if we slept soft as snow and silent as the dew?\n\nThis Barley when unoccupied would fill my study chair,\nAnd utilise much time, and take up space I could not spare,\nTo tell me of the deeds he\u2019d done, his drinkings deep and vast,\nAnd ladies who had loved him in his sanguinary past.\n\nAnd Mrs. Barley dropped in \u2013 in the morning, as a rule \u2013\nAnd stayed till lunch and chattered like a ladies\u2019 boarding-school.\nThen she borrowed bread and onions, and wondered if she might\nLeave her little Willie with us. She was going out till night.\n\nOur little flat\u2019s forsaken; we have left St. Kilda road;\nWe knew not where to go to, and we haven\u2019t an abode;\nBut no flat in any building that we\u2019d suffered in was worth\nThe comfort of a camp-out. So we\u2019re flat upon the earth!"}
