{"subject": "Music", "text": "I hug you, -\nBoth the rainbow to the river\nAnd the clouds flame\nIn God's hand.\nYou laugh, - rain in the sun,\nThe mignonette bedewed,\nAnd cunning is\nA lilac star with eyelash.\nLike a cloven comet\nFigaro clowns.\nMozart's Tarot\nIs cryptic and clear.\nLethean bliss\nSleeps sweet in trombones,\nA tarry monastery rings\nin a copse of violins.\nWhat shadows does\na gaze cast into space?\nYou don't know? And you mustn't\nlook back, my friend.\nWhose heart begins to glisten\nat the blue, blue Si?\nThe Debussy still listens\nwho never was to be."}
