{"subject": "On A Picture Of The Finding Of Moses By Pharoah's Daughter", "text": "This picture does the story express\nOf Moses in the bulrushes.\nHow livelily the painter's hand\nBy colours makes us understand!\nMoses that little infant is.\nThis figure is his sister. This\nFine stately lady is no less\nA personage than a princess,\nDaughter of Pharaoh, Egypt's king;\nWhom Providence did hither bring\nThis little Hebrew child to save.\nSee how near the perilous wave\nHe lies expos\u00ebd in the ark,\nHis rushy cradle, his frail bark!\nPharaoh, king of Egypt land,\nIn his greatness gave command\nTo his slaves, they should destroy\nEvery new-born Hebrew boy.\nThis Moses was an Hebrew's son.\nWhen he was born, his birth to none\nHis mother told, to none revealed,\nBut kept her goodly child concealed.\nThree months she hid him; then she wrought\nWith bulrushes this ark, and brought\nHim in it to this river's side,\nCarefully looking far and wide\nTo see that no Egyptian eye\nHer ark-hid treasure should espy.\nAmong the river-flags she lays\nThe child. Near him his sister stays.\nWe may imagine her affright,\nWhen the king's daughter is in sight.\nSoon the princess will perceive\nThe ark among the flags, and give\nCommand to her attendant maid\nThat its contents shall be displayed.\nWithin the ark the child is found,\nAnd now he utters mournful sound.\nBehold he weeps, as if he were\nAfraid of cruel Egypt's heir!\nShe speaks, she says, 'This little one\nI will protect, though he the son\nBe of an Hebrew.' Every word\nShe speaks is by the sister heard.-\nAnd now observe, this is the part\nThe painter chose to show his art.\nLook at the sister's eager eye,\nAs here she seems advancing nigh.\nLowly she bends, says, 'Shall I go\nAnd call a nurse to thee? I know\nA Hebrew woman liveth near,\nGreat lady, shall I bring her here?'\nSee! Pharaoh's daughter answers, 'Go.'-\nNo more the painter's art can show.\nHe cannot make his figures move.-\nOn the light wings of swiftest love\nThe girl will fly to bring the mother\nTo be the nurse, she'll bring no other.\nTo her will Pharaoh's daughter say,\n'Take this child from me away:\nFor wages nurse him. To my home\nAt proper age this child may come.\nWhen to our palace he is brought,\nWise masters shall for him be sought\nTo train him up, befitting one\nI would protect as my own son.\nAnd Moses be a name unto him,\nBecause I from the waters drew him.'"}
