{"subject": "Members Or Masons", "text": "Oh, his hair was a white as the snow that we tread, \nWith a little black cap on the back of his head, \nAnd he trembled a bit, but I saw in his eyes \nBoth the gaze of a friend and the look of the wise. \nEre they opened the Lodge we just happened to chat: \n'I'm not knocking,' he said, 'don't accuse me of that, \nBut I tell you, my son, if there's anything wrong \nWith the Craft any place, anywhere you belong, \nIn a Lodge that is lacking or lagging behind, \nMore members than Masons you always will find. \n\n'When a fellow gets old, say a fellow like me, \nHe may think that the past is all right, I agree, \nAnd the present all wrong; and yet, nevertheless, \nWe have seen more of men than you youngsters, I guess; \nAnd, if in a Lodge, be it large, be it small, \nThere's a lack of that heart that's the heart of it all, \nAnd a lack of the head that is bowed at the thought \nOf the Craft that it is and the work it has wrought, \nThen, I say, in that Lodge, lacking heart, lacking mind, \nMore members than Masons is what you will find. \n\n'For it isn't enough that we mumble a word, \nNo, it isn't enough that our voice shall be heard, \nBut our acts must be seen \u2014 yes, in word and in act, \nBe a Mason in name and a Mason in fact! \nSixty years I have walked in the face of the storm, \nAnd it kept my head up and it kept my heart warm; \nAnd the need of us now, like the need of us then, \nIs not members but Masons, not members but Men! \nLet us leaven the lump till at last you will find \nAll members, all Masons, in heart and in mind.'"}
