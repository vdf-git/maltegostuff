{"subject": "Boy O' Dreams", "text": "Must I leave you in the mountains,\nBoy o' Dreams?\nMust I leave you where the fountains\nToss the silver of their streams\u2014\nWhere the trees are clothed in samite\nAnd the little broken moon \nIs a symbol and an answer\nLike the reading of a rune?\n\nMay I take you to the city,\nBoy o' Dreams\u2014\nWhere your heart will break with pity\nAt the lethargy that seems\nOnly half alive to living,\nOnly enemy to mirth,\nWhere the dusty facts will blind you\n\nTo the fancies of the earth?\nI must take you, but I'll keep you,\nBoy o' Dreams,\nWhere no alien winds shall sweep you,\nIn a secret place that gleams\nWith the light of your own laughter\u2014\nYours the vessel, yours the chart\u2014\nAnd we'll brave the storms together,\nYou\u2014the captain of my heart!"}
