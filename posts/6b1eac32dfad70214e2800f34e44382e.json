{"subject": "The Path By The Creek", "text": "There is a path that leads\nThrough purple iron-weeds,\nBy button-bush and mallow\nAlong a creek;\nA path that wildflowers hallow,\nThat wild birds seek;\nRoofed thick with eglantine\nAnd grape and trumpet-vine.\n\nThis side, blackberries sweet\nGlow cobalt in the heat;\nThat side, a creamy yellow,\nIn summertime\nThe pawpaws slowly mellow;\nAnd autumn's prime\nStrews red the Chickasaw,\nPersimmon brown and haw.\n\nThe glittering dragon-fly,\nA wing\u00e9d flash, goes by;\nAnd tawny wasp and hornet\nSeem gleams that drone;\nThe beetle, like a garnet,\nSlips from the stone;\nAnd butterflies float there,\nSpangling with gold the air.\n\nHere the brown thrashers hide,\nThe chat and cat-bird chide;\nThe blue kingfisher houses\nAbove the stream,\nAnd here the heron drowses\nLost in his dream;\nThe vireo's flitting note\nHaunts all the wild remote.\n\nAnd now a cow's slow bell\nTinkles along the dell;\nWhere breeze-dropped petals winnow\nFrom blossomy limbs\nOn waters, where the minnow,\nFaint-twinkling, swims;\nWhere, in the root-arched shade,\nSlim prisms of light are laid.\n\nWhen in the tangled thorn\nThe new-moon hangs a horn,\nOr, 'mid the sunset's islands,\nGuides a canoe,\nThe brown owl in the silence\nCalls, and the dew\nBeads here its orbs of damp,\nEach one a firefly lamp.\n\nThen when the night is still\nHere sings the whippoorwill;\nAnd stealthy sounds of crickets,\nAnd winds that pass,\nWhispering, through bramble thickets\nAlong the grass,\nFaint with far scents of hay,\nSeem feet of dreams astray.\n\nAnd where the water shines\nDark through tree-twisted vines,\nSome water-spirit, dreaming,\nBraids in her hair\nA star's reflection; seeming\nA jewel there;\nWhile all the sweet night long\nRipples her quiet song\u2026.\n\nWould I could imitate,\nO path, thy happy state!\nMaking my life all beauty,\nAll bloom and beam;\nKnowing no other duty\nThan just to dream,\nAnd far from pain and woe\nLead feet that come and go.\n\nLeading to calm content,\nO'er ways the Master went,\nThrough lowly things and humble,\nTo peace and love;\nTeaching the lives that stumble\nTo look above,\nForget the world of toil\nAnd all its sad turmoil."}
