{"subject": "A Cloud In Trousers - Part I", "text": "You think malaria makes me delirious? \n\nIt happened. \nIn Odessa it happened. \n\n'I'll come at four,' Maria promised. \n\nEight. \nNine. \nTen. \n\nThen the evening \nturned its back on the windows \nand plunged into grim night, \nscowling \nDecemberish. \n\nAt my decrepit back \nthe candelabras guffawed and whinnied. \n\nYou would not recognise me now: \na bulging bulk of sinews, \ngroaning, \nand writhing, \nWhat can such a clod desire? \nThough a clod, many things! \n\nThe self does not care \nwhether one is cast of bronze \nor the heart has an iron lining. \nAt night the self only desires \nto steep its clangour in softness, \nin woman. \n\nAnd thus, \nenormous, \nI stood hunched by the window, \nand my brow melted the glass. \nWhat will it be: love or no-love? \nAnd what kind of love: \nbig or minute? \nHow could a body like this have a big love? \nIt should be teeny-weeny, \nhumble, little love; \na love that shies at the hooting of cars, \nthat adores the bells of horse-trams. \n\nAgain and again \nnuzzling against the rain, \nmy face pressed against its pitted face, \nI wait, \nsplashed by the city's thundering surf. \n\nThen midnight, amok with a knife, \ncaught up, \ncut him down \nout with him! \n\nThe stroke of twelve fell \nlike a head from a block. \n\nOn the windowpanes, grey raindrops \nhowled together, \npiling on a grimace \nas though the gargoyles \nof Notre Dame were howling. \n\nDamn you! \nIsn't that enough? \nScreams will soon claw my mouth apart. \n\nThen I heard, \nsoftly, \na nerve leap \nlike a sick man from his bed. \nThen, \nbarely moving, \nat first, \nit soon scampered about, \nagitated, \ndistinct. \nNow, with a couple more, \nit darted about in a desperate dance. \n\nThe plaster on the ground floor crashed. \n\nNerves, \nbig nerves, \ntiny nerves, \nmany nerves!\ngalloped madly \ntill soon \ntheir legs gave way. \n\nBut night oozed and oozed through the room\nand the eye, weighed down, could not slither out of \nthe slime. \n\nThe doors suddenly banged ta-ra-bang, \nas though the hotel's teeth \nchattered. \n\nYou swept in abruptly \nlike 'take it or leave it!' \nMauling your suede gloves, \nyou declared: \n'D' you know, \nI'm getting married.' \n\nAll right, marry then. \nSo what, \nI can take it. \nAs you see, I'm calm! \nLike the pulse \nof a corpse. \n\nDo you remember \nhow you used to talk? \n'Jack London, \nmoney, \nlove, \npassion.' \nBut I saw one thing only: \nyou, a Gioconda, \nhad to be stolen! \n\nAnd you were stolen. \n\nIn love, I shall gamble again, \nthe arch of my brows ablaze. \nWhat of it! \nHomeless tramps often find \nshelter in a burnt-out house! \n\nYou're teasing me now? \n'You have fewer emeralds of madness \nthan a beggar has kopeks!' \nBut remember! \nWhen they teased Vesuvius, \nPompeii perished! \n\nHey! \nGentlemen! \nAmateurs \nof sacrilege, \ncrime, \nand carnage, \nhave you seen \nthe terror of terrors \nmy face \nwhen \nI \nam absolutely calm? \n\nI feel \nmy 'I' \nis much too small for me. \nStubbornly a body pushes out of me. \n\nHello! \nWho's speaking? \nMamma? \nMamma! \nYour son is gloriously ill! \nMamma! \nHis heart is on fire. \nTell his sisters, Lyuda and Olya, \nhe has no nook to hide in. \n\nEach word, \neach joke, \nwhich his scorching mouth spews, \njumps like a naked prostitute \nfrom a burning brothel. \n\nPeople sniff \nthe smell of burnt flesh! \nA brigade of men drive up. \nA glittering brigade. \nIn bright helmets. \nBut no jackboots here! \nTell the firemen \nto climb lovingly when a heart's on fire. \nLeave it to me. \nI'll pump barrels of tears from my eyes. \nI'll brace myself against my ribs. \nI'll leap out! Out! Out! \nThey've collapsed. \nYou can't leap out of a heart! \n\nFrom the cracks of the lips \nupon a smouldering face \na cinder of a kiss rises to leap. \n\nMamma! \nI cannot sing. \nIn the heart's chapel the choir loft catches fire! \n\nThe scorched figurines of words and numbers \nscurry from the skull \nlike children from a flaming building. \nThus fear, \nin its effort to grasp at the sky, \nlifted high \nthe flaming arms of the Lusitania. \n\nInto the calm of the apartment \nwhere people quake, \na hundred-eye blaze bursts from the docks. \nMoan \ninto the centuries, \nif you can, a last scream: I'm on fire!"}
