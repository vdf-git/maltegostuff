{"subject": "Sonnet-Xi", "text": "Oh, that I were the spirit of these wilds!\nI'd make the zephyrs dance for my delight,\nAnd lead a life as happy as a child's.\nEcho should tremble with unfeigned affright,\nAnd mock its own weird answers. I would kiss\nEliza's cheek, and touch her lips with dew\nStol'n from the scented rose. And Carrie's laugh\nShould be a portion of the silver rills'\nSweet music, breathed mellifluously through\nThe hearts of generations. She should quaff\nThe nectar of inspired song, and thrills\nOf sweet remembrances of her should strew\nThe woodland air, as sand-grains strew the shore;\nAnd these two hearts should be my joy for evermore."}
