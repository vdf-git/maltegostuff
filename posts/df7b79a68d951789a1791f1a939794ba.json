{"subject": "A Garland, For Advancing Years", "text": "Wear thou this fresh green garland this one day,\nThis white-flowered garland wear for Love's delight,\nWhile still the sun shines, ere the lessening light\nDeclines into the shadows cold and grey:\nWear thou this myrtle leaf while yet ye may,\nLove's wings are wings that hate the dews of night,\nNor will he rest still smiling in our sight,\nAnd still companioning our western way.\n\nWear then this plain green garland this one day,\nTo please Love's eyes, else not for all the might\nOf all the gods, nor any law of right,\nWill he, content with age's disarray,\nFor us pass by the youthful and the gay;\nAnd it were hard to live in love's despite."}
