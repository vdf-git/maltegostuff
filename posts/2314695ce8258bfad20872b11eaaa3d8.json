{"subject": "Convergence Of The Twain", "text": "I\n\nIn a solitude of the sea\nDeep from human vanity,\nAnd the Pride of Life that planned her, stilly couches she.\n\nII\n\nSteel chambers, late the pyres\nOf her salamandrine fires,\nCold currents thrid, and turn to rhythmic tidal lyres.\n\nIII\n\nOver the mirrors meant\nTo glass the opulent\nThe sea-worm crawls -- grotesque, slimed, dumb, indifferent.\n\nIV\n\nJewels in joy designed\nTo ravish the sensuous mind\nLie lightless, all their sparkles bleared and black and blind.\n\nV\n\nDim moon-eyed fishes near\nGaze at the gilded gear\nAnd query: 'What does this vaingloriousness down here?'. . .\n\nVI\n\nWell: while was fashioning\nThis creature of cleaving wing,\nThe Immanent Will that stirs and urges everything\n\nVII\n\nPrepared a sinister mate\nFor her -- so gaily great --\nA Shape of Ice, for the time fat and dissociate.\n\nVIII\n\nAnd as the smart ship grew\nIn stature, grace, and hue\nIn shadowy silent distance grew the Iceberg too.\n\nIX\n\nAlien they seemed to be:\nNo mortal eye could see\nThe intimate welding of their later history.\n\nX\n\nOr sign that they were bent\nBy paths coincident\nOn being anon twin halves of one August event,\n\nXI\n\nTill the Spinner of the Years\nSaid 'Now!' And each one hears,\nAnd consummation comes, and jars two hemispheres."}
