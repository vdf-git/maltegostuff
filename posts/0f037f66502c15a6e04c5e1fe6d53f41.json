{"subject": "Empire-Makers", "text": "Heavy the yoke of Empire: hard its ways\nFor weakling feet to know;\nFilled with fierce war and danger all our days,\nTemptation and sore woe.\nHaply we turn from noble ways that tire,\nMore selfish scenes to scan;\nHaply we grope for glory in the mire;\nElse were we more than man.\n\nNot ours to turn from danger's face away,\nNor e'er for rest to long;\nSchooled to await our death from day to day\nWith steadfast hearts and strong.\nBy ways before untrod blindfold we go,\nUnknowing where to turn;\nYet not unfruitful all our pain and woe;\nAt every step, we learn.\n\nOh, well for you whose lives are set and plann'd,\nHedged in on every side:\nYet, did you stand as we, in unknown land,\nOn trackless wastes and wide,\nAnd seek to find which pathway leads to fame,\nAnd which to deepest hell,\nAnd win for sin applause, for virtue blame,\nSay, would ye know so well?\n\nBut are your lives the happier, you who dwell\nIn peaceful paths apart,\nStriving the structure of your mind to tell,\nSearching your own sad heart:\nOr ours, - who hear in accents sweet and clear\nThe Voices call our name\nAnd win for guerdon but an unknown bier,\nOf haply, deathless fame?"}
