{"subject": "To The Fountain Of Bandusia", "text": "O fountain of Bandusia!\nWhence crystal waters flow,\nWith garlands gay and wine I'll pay\nThe sacrifice I owe;\nA sportive kid with budding horns\nI have, whose crimson blood\nAnon shall dye and sanctify\nThy cool and babbling flood.\n\nO fountain of Bandusia!\nThe Dog-star's hateful spell\nNo evil brings into the springs\nThat from thy bosom well;\nHere oxen, wearied by the plow,\nThe roving cattle here\nHasten in quest of certain rest,\nAnd quaff thy gracious cheer.\n\nO fountain of Bandusia!\nEnnobled shalt thou be,\nFor I shall sing the joys that spring\nBeneath yon ilex-tree.\nYes, fountain of Bandusia,\nPosterity shall know\nThe cooling brooks that from thy nooks\nSinging and dancing go."}
