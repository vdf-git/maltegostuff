{"subject": "To The Daisy", "text": "No, the cold damp earth could not restrain thee,\nNor the bleak north winds retard thy coming;\nFor first on the green where the lambs are running,\nAnd down where the rushing brooklet doth flee,\nIn its musical cadence on to the sea,\nThy sweet face has been modestly turning\nIts delicate features up to the sunning,\nAnd throwing its fragrance over the lea,\nIn a wild and most exuberant way.\nOh, I love thee, wee blue eyed daisy fair!\nAnd I wish thou might blow out there for aye.\nFilled with loveliness, perfuming the air,\nAnd alluring me from the broad highway,\nTo gather garlands for my lady fair.\nThou sit'st upon the meadow's lap of green,\nLike smiles upon the face of a sleeping babe,\nAnd the zephyrs sighing through the everglade,\nWaft thy perfumes to the winding stream\nThat lies at thy feet a beautiful sheen;\nBy the skill of the Master cunningly made,\nTo catch the likeness of my dark eyed maid\nAs she gathers her garlands there, I ween;\nThy Circean beauty bewilders me,\nFor truly, I am curious to know\nWhy the most delicate flowers that be,\nUpon lawn, heather and bough, should first blow,\nFairest and sweetest in their modesty,\nOf all the beautiful flowers that grow."}
