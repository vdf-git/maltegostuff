{"subject": "Be Hopeful: Iii -- The Stream", "text": "A bright stream may shrink in summer's hot fire,\nFlowers on her margin may droop and expire;\nHer channel be dry, her soft gushing tone,\nThe voice of the stream be silent and gone.\nLost nymph of the stream, we find thee again;\nClouds from their treasures have pour'd out the rain;\nThy channel is full, thou glidest along,\nFlowers on thy margin and mirth in thy song.\nBrightly and swiftly, with laughter and song,\nThe life-stream of youth runs sparkling along;\nOft on the margin, enamelled with flowers,\nYouth in wild pleasure is wasting the hours.\nFierce fires of passion are scorching his veins,\nThe bright stream hath shrunk 'neath horrors and pains;\nGod speaks in thunder-the rain-torrent pours-\nThe life-stream again runs fresh 'mong the flowers."}
