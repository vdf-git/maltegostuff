{"subject": "The Trust", "text": "To you, O S\u0153r Ther\u00e8se of Lisieux,\nFresh as a morning rose in morning dew,\nWe give our men in keeping:\nWatch them waking, watch them sleeping.\nLest our hearts should break, O keep trust and be true!\n\nThe old saints are beset with many prayers;\nThe knees of centuries have worn their stairs.\nBut you, O little nun,\nHeaven's youngest, littlest one,\nYou are strong to lift our burdens and our cares.\n\nYour childish hands have roses pink and pale\nThat climb the trellises of Heaven and trail.\nShake your roses down before them,\nYour dear heart be sorry for them,\nKeep them safe within the shadow of your veil.\n\nYou lift hands for France -- O lift them heaven-high,\nFor those who fight with France, who bleed and die.\nPluck the robe of Heaven, O Dear,\nSo the Heart of Heaven may hear,\nThat never yet was hardened to your cry!"}
