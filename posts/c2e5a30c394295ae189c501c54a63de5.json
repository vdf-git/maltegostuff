{"subject": "Granny", "text": "My granny was insane.\nAs her madness ripened into death,\nmy uncle, a miser,\nkept her in our store room\nwrapped in straw.\n\nMy granny dried up, burst; \nher seeds flew out of the window.\nThe sun came, and the rain,\none seedling grew up into a tree,\nwhose lusts bore me.\n\nCan I help writing poems\nAbout monkeys with teeth of gold?"}
