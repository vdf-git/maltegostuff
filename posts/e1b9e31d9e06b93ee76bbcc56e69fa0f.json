{"subject": "The Poet\u2019s Home -", "text": "WE have struggled up the hill-side, \nWe stand upon its brow, \u2014 \nO, lovely as a dream of heaven, \nThe scene before us now! \n\nThere singeth past the woodlands, \nWhere the listening aspens quiver, \nThere shineth through the meadows, \nThe beautiful, bright river. \n\nAnd, farther off, old Ocean \nIs lying at his rest, \nWith the warm and gentle sunlight \nAsleep upon his breast. \n\nBut low down in the village \nIs a cottage, white and small, \nAnd to me that cottage seemeth \nMore glorious than all! \n\nFrom out its portal floweth \nA tide of minstrelsy, \nThat rolleth as a river, \nAnd soundeth as the sea! \n\nIf in storm-shocks meet its waters, \nOr in summer quiet glide, \nA sun that knows no setting \nSmiles on the crystal tide; \u2014 \n\nA sun across whose brightness \nNo lightest cloud is driven, \u2014 \nThe constant, kind approval, \nThe blessed love of Heaven."}
