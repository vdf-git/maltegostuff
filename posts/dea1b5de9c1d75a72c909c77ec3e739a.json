{"subject": "The Letter", "text": "Beloved, men in thick green coats came crunching\nthrough the snow, the insignia on their shoulders\nof uncertain origin, a country I could not be sure of,\na salute so terrifying I heard myself lying to avoid\narrest, and was arrested along with Jocko, whose tear\nhad snapped off, a tiny icicle he put in his mouth.\nWe were taken to the ice prison, a palace encrusted\nwith hoarfrost, its dome lit from within, Jocko admired\nthe wiring, he kicked the walls to test the strength\nof his new boots. A television stood in a block of ice,\nits blue image still moving like a liquid center.\nYou asked for my innermost thoughts. I wonder will I\never see a grape again? When I think of the vineyard\nwhere we met in October-- when you dropped a cluster\ncustom insisted you be kissed by a stranger-- how after\nthe harvest we plunged into a stream so icy our palms\nturned pink. It seemed our future was sealed. Everyone\nsaid so. It is quiet here. Not closing our ranks\nweakens us hugely. The snowflakes fall in a featureless\nbath. I am the stranger who kissed you. On sunny days\neach tree is a glittering chandelier. The power of\nmindless beauty! Jocko told a joke and has been dead\nsince May. A bullethole in his forehead the officers\ncall a third eye. For a month I milked a barnful of\ncows. It is a lot like cleansing a chandelier. Wipe\nand polish, wipe and polish, round and round you go.\nI have lost my spectacles. Is the book I was reading\nstill open by the side of our bed? Treat it as a bookmark\nsaving my place in our story.\n\n(here the letter breaks off)"}
