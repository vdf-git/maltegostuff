{"subject": "The Quarrel", "text": "The Wooden Dog and the China Cat\nFace to face in the doll-house sat,\nAnd they picked a quarrel that grew and grew,\nBecause they had nothing else to do.\nSaid the dog, 'I really would like to hear\nWhy you never stir nor frisk nor purr,\nBut sit like a mummy there.'\n\nUp spoke in a temper the china puss,\nGlad of an opening for a fuss:\n'Dear Mr. Puppy, I can't recall\nThat I ever heard you bark at all.\nYour bark is a wooden bark, 'tis true,\nBut as to that,' said the China Cat,\n'My mew is a china mew.'\n\nSo they bristled and quarreled, more and more,\nTill the baby came creeping across the floor.\nHe took the cat by his whiskers frail,\nHe grasped the dog by his wooden tail,\nAnd banged them together\u2014and after that\nLeft them, a wiser Wooden Dog\nAnd a sadder China Cat.\n\nNow, children, just between you and me,\nDon't you think in the future they will agree?"}
