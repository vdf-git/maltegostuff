{"subject": "Song", "text": "Take me from these dreary shades,\nLift me to some softer morn,\nWhere the laughing light invades\nThat old silence of the glades\nWhich was born when trees were born;\nWhere the docile winds take care\nNot to ruffle any brook,\nLest queen-clouds that pace the air\nShould not find a mirror there\nWhen they pace, and pause, and look;\nWhere the dazzling nights endure\nTill the day has passed its spring,\nAnd where starlight is so pure\nThat no bird is ever sure\nWhether it should sleep or sing.\nSomewhere there is never rain,\nNever trouble in the air,\nNot a sigh of fear or pain,\u2014\nTake me to that land again;\nI am sure I once was there."}
