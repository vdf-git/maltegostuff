{"subject": "Ode 1823", "text": "I don't get tired of you. Don't grow weary\nof being compassionate toward me!\nAll this thirst equipment\nmust surely be tired of me,\nthe waterjar, the water carrier.\n\nI have a thirsty fish in me\nthat can never find enough\nof what it's thirsty for!\n\nShow me the way to the ocean!\nBreak these half-measures,\nthese small containers.\n\nAll this fantasy\nand grief.\n\nLet my house be drowned in the wave\nthat rose last night in the courtyard\nhidden in the center of my chest.\n\nJoseph fell like the moon into my well.\nThe harvest I expected was washed away.\nBut no matter.\n\nA fire has risen above my tombstone hat.\nI don't want learning, or dignity,\nor respectability.\n\nI want this music and this dawn\nand the warmth of your cheek against mine.\n\nThe grief-armies assemble,\nbut I'm not going with them.\n\nThis is how it always is\nwhen I finish a poem.\n\nA great silence comes over me,\nand I wonder why I ever thought\nto use language."}
