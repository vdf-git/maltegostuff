{"subject": "Quebec Scenery", "text": "The scenery around Quebec\nIs beautifully fair,\nNor have I ever yet beheld\nA richer any where.\n\nIN summer, when the leaves are green,\nGo to the Citadel,\nAnd view the all-surrounding scene,\nAnd mark its features well.\n\nFar off the outlined mountain peaks\nSeem propping up the clouds;\nSome hill-topps bright with glory streaks- \nSome hid in misty shrouds.\n\nWithin the vast horizon's girth,\nViewed from this classic height;\nMethinks no fairer spot of earth\nHas ever charmed my sight.\n\nAnd down beneath the rocky steep,\nThe great St. Lawrence flows;\nWhere noble steamers plough the deep,\nAnd gallant ships repose.\n\nO! beauteous river deep and wide,\nOur great commercial mart;\nWhat wealth comes floating o'er thy tide- \nWhat treasures, too, depart!\n\nOrleans, that doubly gifted isle\nOf groves and fertile glades,\nInvites you down a little while\nTo see her sylvan shades.\n\nO! happy are the favoured few\nWho, when the days are hot,\nMay go, and pleasure's path pursue\nIn that delightful spot.\n\nAnd should you other scenes explore,\nThen go where nature calls,\nAnd listen to the deaf'ning roar\nAt Montmorency Falls.\n\nSee how the reckless, rushing stream\nComes dashing down the steep;\nAnd how the bursting bubbles gleam\nAlong the boiling deep.\n\nOr should you wander up the stream,\nYou may, without a doubt,\nSoon realize old Walton's theme\nWith many a speckled trout.\n\nOr you may go on pilgrimage\nAnd seek that sacred shrine,\nWhere faith may sufferings assuage\nThrough agency divine.\n\nThe scenery is beautiful\nAround the bon Ste. Anne,\nAnd nothing there is dark or dull\nExcept poor sinful man.\n\nThe crowding forest-covered hills,\nOutline the beauteous scene;\nWhile sparkling, laughing crystal rills\nFlow through the vales between.\n\nAnd all around, the cultured dales\nAre thronged with happy homes;\nWhere conscious luxury prevails,\nAnd trouble seldom comes.\n\nOr should you wander back in thought,\nFew other parts could yield\nSo many scenes of battle fought\nOn many a bloody field.\n\nOr if a darker scene be view'd,\nYou still the spot may trace,\nWhere savage hordes have been subdued,\nOr massacres took place.\n\nThe tomahawk and scalping knife\nAre buried with the dead;\nThe savage yell and deadly strife\nFor evermore have fled.\n\nPerhaps a temple marks the place\nWhere once a wigwam stood;\nWhile in that meadow you might trace\nA field once stained with blood.\n\nAnd you may view the battle field,\nAnd mark the very spot,\nWhere Britain's foes were forced to yield- \nWhere General Wolf was shot.\n\nAnd while you mourn our hero's death\nThink of Montcalm as well,\nWho fought and breathed his latest breath\nNear this old Citadel.\n\nThe victors and the vanquished have\nLong since been turn'd to dust,\nYet love still decorates the grave\nWhich holds the good and just.\n\nMontgomery in his reckless zeal\nReceived a final check,\nAnd he and his compelled to feel\nThe prowess of Quebec.\n\nThe spot, now from your sight concealed,\nWhere brave Montgomery fell;\nAnd many another battlefield\nSurround this Citadel.\n\nBut peace prevails. O! glorious peace,\nIn which my soul delights;\nFor joy and plentiness increase\nAs men decrease their fights.\n\nThe scenes I love are spread around,\nWithin the circling hills;\nThe verdant mead, the cultured ground,\nGroves, valleys, rocks and rills.\n\nQuebec presents a pleasing view\nFrom this old rocky height;\nAnd piles of buildings, old and new,\nAttract your wondering sight.\n\nOur city streets are not our pride\nAs every one may see;\nThey're neither clean nor straight nor wide\nNor what they ought to be.\n\nStill we have buildings great and grand,\nAnd many a stately fane;\nAnd forts and guns at our command,\nThe foeman to restrain.\n\nAnd we have Banks and wealthy men,\nAnd men of business too;\nAnd men who know the where and when,\nAnd what they ought to do.\n\nOur shipping interests are great,\nOur Railway system thrives;\nOur trade is in a healthy state,\nAnd enterprise revives.\n\nAll willing hands who seek employ\nMay find enough to do;\nAnd here the tourist may enjoy\nA sense of pleasure too.\n\nThe Battery and Esplanade\nAre crowded with delights;\nBut Dufferin Terrace takes the lead\nOf all our glorious sights.\n\nSo beautiful, a work of art,\nBuilt on this rocky height;\nWith everything that could impart\nA scene of sweet delight.\n\nAnd on this grand old storied height\nI'll leave you to enjoy\nThe beautiful surrounding sight;\nAnd bid you all good-bye."}
