{"subject": "Visiting A Taoist On Tiatien Mountain", "text": "Amongst bubbling streams\na dog barks; peach blossom\nis heavy with dew; here\nand there a deer can\nbe seen in forest glades!\nNo sound of the mid-day\nbell enters this fastness\nwhere blue mist rises\nfrom bamboo groves;\ndown from a high peak\nhangs a waterfall;\nnon knows where he has gone, so sadly I rest,\nwith my back leaning\nagainst a pine."}
