{"subject": "Friends (Advice To My Children)", "text": "Few things will hurt you more\nThan the envy of old friends.\nSometimes, their silence will reach you\nAcross vast oceans. You will hear it, weighing\nIn your own voice, asking why: why\nIs there time for all the distractions the world delivers\nBut not for a word of concern.                       \n\nSometimes their very praise will \nHurt:\"You must have been practising,\" or\n\"You are definitely better than before,\"as if you needed pity; \nAny success will hurt them, deeply:\nThey will not forgive you easily:\nThey will need to pity.\n\nThey will need to speak.\n\nSometimes their anger will brood for years:\nA joke or insult long forgotten - you thought - \nWill return in deep disguise\nAs a snub, a lack of mention, a deliberate\nStalling of affection, a dinner party without\nYou, a vote placed \nElsewhere.\n\nAnd if you should ever have a friend\nWho outshines you:\nDo not damn yourself \nWith faint praise of her.\nLet her shining warm your heart\nAnd bring smiling to your deepest self.\nDo not begrudge her the tiny dazzling\nIn which she danced; \nShare that moment, let it live in you both,\nBefore it dies forever\nIn the ordinariness which drowns us all."}
