{"subject": "(\"the green way\")", "text": "Street glistens with dim, watery light,\n          some of the stones dark with dew,\n          others gray\nor rose.  You walk this street every day.\nThe river is high at the moment.\nThe foot of the road has flooded.\n          You pass the yellow house\n          with green shutters, its yard \nof Queen Anne's Lace, paint-brush,\n          the bluebells and bleeding-hearts \n          strung like pennants, and turn\nbecause you feel warmth from early sun\n          on your face.  Your patent leather shoes \n          still new for school.  Their shine attracts\nyour gaze.  The way you know to walk \non your own is past the cemetery,\nthe small, unpainted houses\n          among the trees, green with June."}
