{"subject": "Public Gardens", "text": "Along the High Street people flock, a seething human stream,\nAnd just a few steps from it all, I sit alone and dream.\nTall, shaggy-headed Dahlias look down into my face,\nAs I drink in the beauty of this quiet and lovely place.\n\nBeyond the iron railings traffic roars and rolls along,\nWhile overhead the bird-choirs fill the air with happy song.\nThe sodden, tattered autumn leaves come falling one by one,\nThe bronze and red chrysanthemums are glowing in the sun.\n\nA white swan moves upon the lake where willows dip their gold,\nBetween the Yews the parish church looks dim and grey and old.\nI don't know who has given us this beautiful retreat,\nWhere birds make song and flowers bloom just off the crowded street,\nBut thank you, thank you, thank you to whoever it may be\nWho gave the town this quiet place - this garden sanctuary."}
