{"subject": "The General Elliott", "text": "He fell in victory's fierce pursuit,\nHoled through and through with shot,\nA sabre sweep had hacked him deep\nTwixt neck and shoulderknot....\n\nThe potman cannot well recall,\nThe ostler never knew,\nWhether his day was Malplaquet,\nThe Boyne or Waterloo.\n\nBut there he hangs for tavern sign,\nWith foolish bold regard\nFor cock and hen and loitering men\nAnd wagons down the yard.\n\nRaised high above the hayseed world\nHe smokes his painted pipe,\nAnd now surveys the orchard ways,\nThe damsons clustering ripe.\n\nHe sees the churchyard slabs beyond,\nWhere country neighbours lie,\nTheir brief renown set lowly down;\nHis name assaults the sky.\n\nHe grips the tankard of brown ale\nThat spills a generous foam:\nOft-times he drinks, they say, and winks\nAt drunk men lurching home.\n\nNo upstart hero may usurp\nThat honoured swinging seat;\nHis seasons pass with pipe and glass\nUntil the tale's complete.\n\nAnd paint shall keep his buttons bright\nThough all the world's forgot\nWhether he died for England's pride\nBy battle, or by pot."}
