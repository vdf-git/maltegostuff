{"subject": "Negress In Notre Dame", "text": "When I attended Mass today\nA coloured maid sat down by me,\nAnd as I watched her kneel and pray,\nHer reverence was good to see.\nFor whether there may be or no'\nA merciful and mighty God,\nThe love for Him is like a glow\nThat glorifies the meanest clod.\n\nAnd then a starched and snotty dame\nWho sat the other side of me\nSaid: \"Monsieur, is it not a shame\nSuch things should be allowed to be?\nIn my homeland, I'm proud to say,\nWe know to handle niggers right,\nAnd wouldn't let a black wench pray\nAnd worship God beside a white.\"\n\nHer tone so tart bewilderd me,\nFor I am just a simple man.\nA friend in every one I see,\nThough yellow, brown or black and tan.\nFor I would father children five\nWith any comely coloured maid,\nAnd lush with any man alive,\nOf any race, of any shade.\n\nReligion may be false or true,\nThe Churches may be wrong or right,\nBut if there be the Faith in you\nIt can be like a shining light.\nAnd though I lack not piety\nAnd pray my best, I'm sure that God\nTo that black wench and not to me\nWould give his most approving nod.\n\nAye, you may scrub him day and night,\nYou'll never change a nigger's hide;\nBut maybe he is just as white,\n(Or even more) than you...inside."}
