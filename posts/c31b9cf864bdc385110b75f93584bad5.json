{"subject": "Tourists", "text": "In a strange town in a far land\n          They met amid a throng;\nThey stared, they could not understand\n          How life was sudden song.\nAs brown eyes looked in eyes of grey\n          Just for a moment's space,\nTwin spirits met with sweet dismay\n                    In that strange place.\n\nAnd then the mob that swept them near\n          Reft them away again;\nTwo hearts in all the world most dear\n          Knew puzzlement and pain.\nThey barely brushed in passing by,\n          A wildered girl and boy,\nWho should have clasped with laughing cry,\n                    And wept for joy.\n\nBut no, the crowd cleft them apart,\n          And she went East, he West;\nBut there was havoc in his heart\n          And brooding in her breast.\nIn a far land, in a strange town\n          Amid a mob they met;\nThey stared, they passed . . . But O deep down,\n          Can they forget?"}
