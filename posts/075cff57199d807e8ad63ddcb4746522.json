{"subject": "Psalm 20", "text": "Prayer and hope of victory.\nFor a day of prayer in time of war.\n\nNow may the God of power and grace\nAttend his people's humble cry!\nJehovah hears when Isr'el prays,\nAnd brings deliverance from on high.\n\nThe name of Jacob's God defends\nBetter than shields or brazen walls;\nHe from his sanctuary sends\nSuccor and strength, when Zion calls.\n\nWell he remembers all our sighs,\nHis love exceeds our best deserts;\nHis love accepts the sacrifice\nOf humble groans and broken hearts.\n\nIn his salvation is our hope,\nAnd, in the name of Isr'el's God,\nOur troops shall lift their banners up,\nOur navies spread their flags abroad.\n\nSome trust in horses trained for war,\nAnd some of chariots make their boasts:\nOur surest expectations are\nFrom thee, the Lord of heav'nly hosts.\n\n\n\nNow save us, Lord, from slavish fear,\nNow let our hopes be firm and strong,\nTill the salvation shall appear,\nAnd joy and triumph raise the song."}
