{"subject": "High Tension Lines Across A Landscape", "text": "There are diagrams on stilts all wired together   \nOver the hill and the wind and out of sight.   \nThere is a scar in the trees where they walk away   \nBeyond me. There are signs of something   \nNearly God (or at least most curious)\nAbout them. I think those diagrams are not   \nAt rest.\n            I think they are a way of ciphering God:   \nHe is the hugest socket and all his miracles\nAre wired behind him scarring the hill and the wind   \nAs the waterfall flies roaring to his city\nOn the open palms of the diagram.\n                                                   There is\nShining, I suppose, in that city at night\nAnd measure for miracles, and wheels whirling   \nSo quick-silver they seem to be going backwards.   \nAnd there's a miracle already. But I\nWent naked through his wood of diagrams   \nOn a day of the rain beside me to his city.\n\nWhen I kissed that socket with my wet lip   \nMy teeth fell out, my fingers sprouted chives,   \nAnd what a bald head chewed on my sick heart!"}
