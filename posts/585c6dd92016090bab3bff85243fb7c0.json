{"subject": "Range-Finding", "text": "The battle rent a cobweb diamond-strung\nAnd cut a flower beside a ground bird's nest\nBefore it stained a single human breast.\nThe stricken flower bent double and so hung.\nAnd still the bird revisited her young.\nA butterfly its fall had dispossessed\nA moment sought in air his flower of rest,\nThen lightly stooped to it and fluttering clung. \n\nOn the bare upland pasture there had spread\nO'ernight 'twixt mullein stalks a wheel of thread\nAnd straining cables wet with silver dew.\nA sudden passing bullet shook it dry.\nThe indwelling spider ran to greet the fly,\nBut finding nothing, sullenly withdrew."}
