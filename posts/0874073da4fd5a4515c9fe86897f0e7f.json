{"subject": "An Ordinary Rose", "text": "I saw a rose, an ordinary rose \nIt struggled to be seen \nIn a garden overgrown \nWith harsh reality. I saw a rose, an ordinary rose \nAnd this rose spoke to me, \nPleading for attention: \nIs beauty not a need? I stopped to touch this ordinary rose \nAnd it reached out to me, \nImparting its sweet fragrance \nTo my senses gratefully. I saw a man, an ordinary man \nWho struggled to be seen, \nHis spirit languished on the streets \nIn dire neglect and need. I stopped to help this ordinary man \nWho struggled to be seen, \nAnd like the rose that bloomed with care \nHe too reached out to me. Fate placed these roses in our midst \nSo why should we complain? \nRemember who created them \nWho witnesses their pain. When next you meet that special rose \nThat struggles to be seen, \nRemember, but for fate alone \nThat could be you or me."}
