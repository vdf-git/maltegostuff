{"subject": "Pride: Fate", "text": "Lullaby on the wing\nOf my song, O my own!\nSoft airs of evening\nJoin my song's murmuring tone.\n\nLullaby, O my love!\nClose your eyes, lake-like clear;\nLullaby, while above\nWake the stars, with heaven near.\n\nLullaby, sweet, so still\nIn arms of death; I alone\nSing lullaby, like a rill,\nTo your form, cold as a stone.\n\nLullaby, O my heart!\nSleep in peace, all alone;\nNight has come, and your part\nFor loving is wholly done!"}
