{"subject": "The President Flies Over", "text": "Aloft between heaven and them,\n\nI babble the landscape\u2014what staunch, vicious trees,\nwhat cluttered roads, slow cars. This is my\n\ncountry as it was gifted me\u2014victimless, vast.\nThe soundtrack buzzing the air around my ears\ncontinually loops ditties of eagles and oil.\nI can't choose. Every moment I'm awake,\naroused instrumentals channel theme songs,\nspeaking\nwhat I cannot.\n\nI don't ever have to come down.\nI can stay hooked to heaven,\ndictating this blandness.\nMy flyboys memorize flip and soar.\nThey'll never swoop real enough\nto resurrect that other country,\n\nwon't ever get close enough to give name\nto tonight's dreams darkening the water.\n\nI understand that somewhere it has rained."}
