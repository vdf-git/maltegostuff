{"subject": "Duality", "text": "Perhaps I hold people to impossible ideals, \nI tell them, something is wrong with your \npersonality, (you're a drinker, you're \ntoo dependent, or I think you have \na mother/son fixation). This is usually \nfollowed by passionate lovemaking,\none good long and very well meaning \nembrace, and then I'm out the door.  \n\nIn daylight, I'll tip my sunglasses forward, \nbuy a cup of tea and think of the good \nI've done for the world, how satisfying \nit feels to give a man something to contemplate. \nThe heart is a whittled twig. No, that is not \nthe right image, so I drop the heart in a pile \nof wood and light that massive text on fire.    \n\nI walk the streets of Brooklyn looking \nat this storefront and that, buy a pair of shoes \nI can't afford, pumps from London, pointed \nat the tip and heartbreakingly high, hear \nmy new heels clicking, crushing the legs \nof my shadow. The woman who wears \nthese shoes will be a warrior, will not think \nabout how wrong she is, how her calculations \nlook like the face of a clock with hands \nticking with each terrorizing minute. \n\nShe will for an instant feel so much \nfor the man, she left him lying in his bed \nsoftly weeping. He whispers something \nto himself  like bitch, witch, cold hearted \n______,  but he'll think back to the day \nat the promenade when there was no one there \nbut the two of them, the entire city falling away \ninto a thin film of yellow and then black, \n\nand how she squeezed his hand, kissed him \non his wrist which bore a beautifully healed \nscar, he will love her between instances \nof cursing her name. She will have long \nfallen asleep in her own bed, a thin nude \nwith shoes like stilts, shoes squeezing \nthe blood out of her feet, and in her sleep \nshe rises above a disappearing city, her head \ntouching a remote heaven, though below her, \ncloser to the ground, she feels an ache at the bottom."}
