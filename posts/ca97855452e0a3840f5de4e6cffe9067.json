{"subject": "Chaos Crystallising", "text": "Give it only time enough,\nEvery thing shall find its place;\nEvery creature wins its race,\nThough the course be rough.\n\nAll is not Mistake on earth;\nProvidence fulfils its plan;\nAnd Creation, down to man,\nJustifies its birth.\n\nFolly builds her Babel tower,\nWhere,-- since Wisdom well permits,\nGrey Old Sin a Nimrod sits\nFor his human hour:\n\nLet a little time have fled,\nAnd anon it topples down;\nAnd we tear away the crown\nFrom that usurper's head!\n\nAll shall yet be right at last;\nComing Day shall clear it up; \nAnd Creation's stirrup-cup\nSweeten all the past.\n\nGood achieves its glorious ends;\nSoon for Evil's transient reign,\nSpite of guilt and grief and pain,\nMaking rich amends.\n\nNow, like crstallising salts,\nAll is seen confusion here;\nBut right soon it shall appear\nWisdom makes no faults:\n\nAtom to its atom flies,\nEvery bevill'd angle fits,\nTill at length fair Order sits\nEnthroned on earth and skies."}
