{"subject": "Stars", "text": "How pretty is each little star,\nEach tiny twinkler, soft and meek!\nYet many in this world there are\nWho do not know that stars can speak.\nTo them the skies are meaningless,\nA star is not a living thing;\nThey cannot hear the messages\nThose shining creatures love to bring.\n\nHush! listen! ah! it will not do;\nYou do but listen with your ears;\nAnd stars are understood by few,\nFor it must be the heart that hears.\nLook up, not only with your eyes;\nAh! do you hear a tender sound?\nTo hearts familiar with the skies,\nThe stars are nearer than the ground."}
