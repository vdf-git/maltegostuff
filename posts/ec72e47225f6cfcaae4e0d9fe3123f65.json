{"subject": "Athe Anniverse. An Elegy.", "text": "So soon grown old! hast thou been six years dead? \nPoor earth, once by my Love inhabited! \nAnd must I live to calculate the time \nTo which thy blooming youth could never climbe, \nBut fell in the ascent! yet have not I \nStudi'd enough thy losses history. \nHow happy were mankind if Death's strict lawes \nConsum'd our lamentations like the cause! \nOr that our grief turning to dust might end \nWith the dissolved body of a friend! \nBut sacred Heaven! O how just thou art \nIn stamping deaths impression on that heart \nWhich through thy favours would grow insolent, \nWere it not physick't by sharp discontent. \nIf then it stand resolv'd in thy decree \nThat still I must doom'd to a Desart be \nSprung out of my lone thoughts, which know no path \nBut what my own misfortune beaten hath: \nIf thou wilt bind me living to a coarse, \nAnd I must slowly waste; I then of force \nStoop to thy great appointment, and obey \nThat will which nought avail me to gainsay. \nFor whil'st in sorrowes Maze I wander on, \nI do but follow lifes vocation. \nSure we were made to grieve: at our first birth \nWith cries we took possession of the earth; \nAnd though the lucky man reputed be \nFortunes adopted son, yet onely he \nIs Natures true born child, who summes his years \n(Like me) with no Arithmetick but tears."}
