{"subject": "Dedication", "text": "The pathway to my heart by few\nIs sought, to few that pathway known,\nSo deep a thicket round it sown,\nWith grass and moss and weeds o'ergrown\nThe path itself, half hid from sight.\nAnd hadst thou come with knocking light\nOr loud, then from my windows pain\nHad looked, a dreary chatelaine\nAnd bid thee from the house, unmeet\nSo bright a guest to entertain.\nBut thou, with shy misgiving sweet,\nUpon the threshold for awhile\nDidst pause, and then with footstep fleet,\nAnd ready, gay, victorious smile,\nAs one unused to plead or sue,\nDidst lightly cross it o'er, made bold\nBy love, and like the Greek of old\nSat down beside my hearth, and there\nI found thee seated, kind and fair,\nTo all around thee giving grace,\nAs one that takes a wonted place,\nNor causeth toil, nor bringeth care.\nThen stay, dear friend, and be thou free\nOf all my hospitality!\nAnd doubt not I for thee shall find\nSome leaf, some blossom, left behind,\nSome bloom evanishing, some tone\nThat love and joy will not disown,\nSome amber rosary of fair\nWarm-scented beads, whereon a prayer\nYet lingers, or some amulet\nEnshrouded in a golden fret;\nAnd from my lute a strain shall flow;\nAnd in my heart a flower will blow\nFrom out life's very ashes kissed!\nTo life by thee, sweet alchemist!\n\nJuly 18th, 1875"}
