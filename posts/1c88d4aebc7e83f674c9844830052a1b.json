{"subject": "The Story Without End", "text": "Before my time my kindred were\nAs felons in their land,\nBecause they claimed the liberty\nThat freemen understand.\nEre I was born in Dublin town\nMen's hearts were still aflame;\nThey spoke of Allen and O'Brien,\nAnd whispered Larkin's name.\nWhen I slept on my mother's breast,\nA little babe, and frail,\nYoung Duffy's hearse went slowly by\nHe died in Milbank Jail.\nWhen I could read, I spelt and knew\nThe lives of patriot men;\nWhen I could write, my pencil traced\u2014\n'A Nation Once Again.'\n\nI learnt of those who often knew\nThe baton and the cell,\nWho asked for right by peaceful means\u2014\nO'Connell to Parnell.\nAnd once when thro' the cheering streets\nSome 'felon' homeward came\nI lit, amongst the gayer lights,\nMy candle's tiny flame.\nWhen I was but a little child\nI ran by Kickham's side;\nI heard his bitter story told\nIn reverence and pride.\nAnd when with years he passed away,\nWhen life was young and fair,\nI stood upon time's crowded path,\nAnd met O'Leary there.\n\nI saw with pity and amaze\nA craven party go,\nObedient to a Scotsman's word,\nFor Parnell's overthrow.\nBefore Kilmainham's bloodstained walls\nI stood all cold and still;\nI lived through all the awful night\nThat shadowed Pentonville.\nIf thus o'er one life's blotted page\nSome neutral soul should bend,\nHe'll read to-day\u2014as yesterday\u2014\nThe story without end."}
