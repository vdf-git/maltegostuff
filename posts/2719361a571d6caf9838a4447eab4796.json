{"subject": "Thy Kingdom Come", "text": "Come Thy kingdom! of all blessings,\nOf all prayers the first is this;\nAll heaven's hopes,-all earth's possessings,\nGrace and glory, peace and bliss,\nCentring in the holy word,\nIn the kingdom of the Lord.\nLet Thy kingdom come! its coming,\nBy the Gospel-light assured,\nIn the distant dawn is looming,\nSanctioned, sanctified, secured;\nBy the Great Creator's plan\nHeaven's unveiled, and rescued man.\nYes! Thy kingdom shall be founded\nOn the eternal base of truth,\nBy its crystal walls surrounded,\nBright as diamonds, pure as youth.\nKingdom of the Lord! appear,\nSpeak the word! and lo 'tis here!"}
