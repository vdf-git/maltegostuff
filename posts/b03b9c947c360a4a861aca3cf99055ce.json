{"subject": "Tribute To A Lost Steamer", "text": "O! sing ye a dirge for the loved and the lost,\nThat have found them a home 'neath the coral reefs\ndeep;\nThat have laid them to rest 'neath the murmuring\nsurge,\nWhere the whistling wind wails o'er their sweet,\nbut sad sleep.\n\nThey have gone to their home-their last resting-place\nThe blue waves embraced and called them their own;\nWhile the depths of the sea and the billows thereof\nAre mournfully sighing their sad requiem.\n\nDown, down through the mass of the waters they sped,\nAmid the dark chambers so mystic, so drear;\n'Till perchance they selected some ruby-lit bed,\nTo sleep their last sleep 'mid jeweled gems rare.\n\nO! 'tis sweet now to ponder, though many have gone\nTo that far-off bourne whence no traveller returns,\nThat the sea shall not always their bodies retain,\nFor Jehovah hath said, she must yield them again.\n\nOne bright little jewel outlived the dark storm,\nSo fatal to many, yet-blissful to tell-\nHis 'Father in heaven' preserved him from harm,\nO, parent rejoice! with your Louis 'tis well."}
