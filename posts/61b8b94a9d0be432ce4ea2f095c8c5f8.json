{"subject": "Song 1", "text": "I LOVE to lie \nIn the dreamy heat of an autumn day, \nWhere the painted insects idly play, \nFloating about in the noontide ray; \nOr at evening hours \nBy the gilly-flower on the old grey wall, \nAnd the scented pea, and the sun-flower tall, \nAnd the ivy training over them all, \nIn the time of flowers. \n\nBy the deep old moat where the duckweed grows, \nAnd the drowsy streamlet scarcely flows, \nOverhung with garlands of gay wild rose \nAnd bryony, \nWhere mosses carpet each sloping mound, \nAnd the white convolvulus twineth round \nThe cluster'd shrubs and over the ground, \nI love to lie; \n\nWhere all is still, and warm, and bright, \nOr glowing with a chasten'd light, \nWhich fades away in a moonlit night, \nIn every time \nEre the death of the flowers, while the wandering breeze \nWhispers and laughs 'mid the crowned trees, \nTo the song of the birds and the hum of the bees \nI would lie and rhyme."}
