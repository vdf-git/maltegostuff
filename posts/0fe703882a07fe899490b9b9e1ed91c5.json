{"subject": "After Armageddon", "text": "God walks lightly in the gardens of a cold, dark star,\nKnowing not the dust that gathers in His garments' fold;\nGod signs Him with the clay, marks Him with the mould,\nWalking in the fields unsunned of a sad, lost war,\nIn a star long cold.\n\nGod treads brightly where the bones of unknown things lie,\nPale with His splendor as the frost in a moon-bleached place;\nGod sees the tombs by the light of His face,\nHe shudders at the runes writ thereon, and His shadow on the sky\nShudders hugely in space.\n\nGod talks briefly with His armies of the tomb-born worm,\nGod holds parley with the grey worm and pale, avid moth:\nTheir mouths have eaten all, but the worm is wroth\nWith a dark hunger still, and he murmurs harm\nWith the murmuring moth.\n\nGod turns Him heavenward in haste from a death-dark star,\nBut His robes are assoil\u00e8d by the dust of unknown things dead;\nThe grey worm follows creeping, and the pale moth has fed\nCouched in a secret golden fold of His broad-trained cimar\nLike a doom unsaid."}
