{"subject": "Nevertheless", "text": "you've seen a strawberry\nthat's had a struggle; yet\nwas, where the fragments met,\n\na hedgehog or a star-\nfish for the multitude\nof seeds. What better food\n\nthan apple seeds - the fruit\nwithin the fruit - locked in\nlike counter-curved twin\n\nhazelnuts? Frost that kills\nthe little rubber-plant -\nleaves of kok-sagyyz-stalks, can't\n\nharm the roots; they still grow \nin frozen ground. Once where\nthere was a prickley-pear - \n\nleaf clinging to a barbed wire,\na root shot down to grow\nin earth two feet below;\n\nas carrots from mandrakes\nor a ram's-horn root some-\ntimes. Victory won't come\n\nto me unless I go\nto it; a grape tendril\nties a knot in knots till\n\nknotted thirty times - so\nthe bound twig that's under-\ngone and over-gone, can't stir.\n\nThe weak overcomes its\nmenace, the strong over-\ncomes itself. What is there\n\nlike fortitude! What sap\nwent through that little thread\nto make the cherry red!"}
