{"subject": "Mont Blanc", "text": "Mount! I have watcht thee, at the fall of dew,\nArray thee in thy panoply of gold,--\nAnd then cast over it thy rosy vest,--\nAnd last that awful robe that looks so cold,\nThy ghastly spectre--dress of nameless hue:\nThen thou art least of earth, and then I love thee best."}
