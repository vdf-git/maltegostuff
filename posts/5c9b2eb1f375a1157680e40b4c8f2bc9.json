{"subject": "Gazal -1", "text": "My life without your company,\nI do not mind the pangs,\nFor cactus has inspired in me\nThe dreams of spring and you.\n\nMy shattered heart and so much light! \nI do not know the cause.\nWas it the shooting meteor\nI saw lighten the night?\n\nThe city lies in darkness\nEven when day has come.\nThe sun with hope defeated\nIs living an eclipsed life.\n\nThe world in lurking mirage trapped,\nAnd deceptions all around,\nThe lapping waves in lakes beyond\nAre nothing but sandy traps.\n\nA bunch of thorns in heart concealed\nA bouquet held in hand,\nA master of deception but hard to detect.\nHe lurks in our midst.\n\nSpring has descended\nOn withered boughs of memories\nAnd brought along its wake for me,\nA bouquet of light for weary sight.\n\nDreams that keep the trees alive\nThrough all the changing seasons,\nAre that the birds would come some day\nTo build their nests and sing.\n\nTo fend the mirrors against flying stones,\nTo keep them safe from hazards all,\nGive them a shield of the very stones,\nThat threatens mirror's  life.\n\nLet us venture out and look together\nFor lands where clouds are blessings\nWhere clouds can bathe our thirsty souls\nIn life nourshing rains."}
