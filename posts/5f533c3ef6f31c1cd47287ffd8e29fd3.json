{"subject": "The Swan At Edgewater Park", "text": "Isn't one of your prissy richpeoples' swans\nWouldn't be at home on some pristine pond\nChooses the whole stinking shoreline, candy wrappers, condoms\n     in its tidal fringe\nPrefers to curve its muscular, slightly grubby neck\n     into the body of a Great Lake,\nSwilling whatever it is swans swill,\nChardonnay of algae with bouquet of crud,\nWhile Clevelanders walk by saying Look\n     at that big duck!\nBeauty isn't the point here; of course\n     the swan is beautiful,\nBut not like Lorie at 16, when\nEverything was possible--no\nMore like Lorie at 27\nSmoking away her days off in her dirty kitchen,\nHer kid with asthma watching TV,\nThe boyfriend who doesn't know yet she's gonna\nLeave him, washing his car out back--and \nHe's a runty little guy, and drinks too much, and\nIt's not his kid anyway, but he loves her, he\nReally does, he loves them both--\nThat's the kind of swan this is."}
