{"subject": "The Customs Men", "text": "Those who say Gord Struth; those who say Swelp Me - \npensioned soldiers and sailors, the wreckage of Empire - \nare nothing, nothing at all, compared with the warriors of Excise \nwho slash the blue frontiers with their great axe-blows. \nPipes in their teeth, blades in their hands, deep, unruffled, \nwhen darkness noses at the woods like a cow's muzzle, off they go, \nleading their dogs, to hold their nocturnal and terrible revels! \nThey report the bacchantes to the laws of today. \nThey clap hands on the shoulders of Fausts and of Devils: \n'Now then, none of that, you old dodgers! Put those bundles down!' \nAnd, when his serene highness accosts the young, \nthe Customs Man holds fast to all contraband charms! \nThe Inferno for Offenders whom his hand has frisked!"}
