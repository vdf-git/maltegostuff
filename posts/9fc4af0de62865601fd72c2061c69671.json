{"subject": "Seasons", "text": "I heard the forest's green heart beat\nAs if it heard the happy feet\nOf one who came, like young Desire:\nAt whose fair coming birds and flowers\nSprang up, and Beauty, filled with fire,\nTouched lips with Song amid the bowers\nAnd Love led on the dancing Hours.\n\nII.\n\nAnd then I heard a voice that rang,\nAnd to the leaves and blossoms sang:\n'My child is Life: I dwell with Truth:\nI am the Spirit glad of Birth:\nI bring to all things joy and youth:\nI am the rapture of the Earth.\nCome look on me and know my worth.'\n\nIII.\n\nAnd then the woodland heaved a sigh,\nAs if it saw a shape go by\nA shape of sorrow or of dread,\nThat seemed to move as moves a mist,\nAnd left the leaves and flowers dead,\nAnd with cold lips my forehead kissed,\nWhile phantoms all around held tryst.\n\nIV.\n\nAnd then I heard a voice that spoke\nUnto the fading beech and oak:\n'I am the Spirit of Decay,\nWhose child is Death, that means relief:\nI breathe and all things pass away:\nI am Earth's glory and its grief.\nCome look on me: thy time is brief.'"}
