{"subject": "The Pangs Of Love Areconsuming Me", "text": "The pangs of love are consuming me.\n    Beloved, I offer you my life.\n\n    He has gone along the green bank.\n    But I'll pursue him down every stream,\n    Like Heemaal in search of Naagiray.\n\n    I'm bathed in sweat, with strength ebbed out,\n    Following my love over hill and dale.\n    Why can't he halt and hear my prayer ?\n\n    The king of hunters pierced my heart\n    With well-aimed shafts of dalliance.\n    God alone knows why he's cross with me !\n\n    If my love comes, I'll wait on him\n    As a loyal slave, and offer him\n    All the sweets the world has seen.\n\n    O be my guest, and let me serve !\n    I shall dance round you like a bee.\n    I've stocked the sweetest pollen!\n\n    Sleep has forsaken me. I use the night\n    To pick dove's saffron from the flowers.\n    Come in the moonlight to see my art.\n\n    How long more will it be so ?\n    Majoor has waited for ages.\n    Does his beloved have no compassion ?"}
