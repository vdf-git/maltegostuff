{"subject": "Kathaleen Ny-Houlahan", "text": "LONG they pine in weary woe - the nobles of our land -\nLong they wander to and fro, proscribed, alas! and banned;\nFeastless, houseless, altarless, they bear the exie's brand,\nBut their hope is in the coming-to of Kathaleen Ny-Houlahan.\n\nThink not her a ghastly hag, too hideous to be seen;\nCall her not unseemly names, our matchless Kathaleen;\nYoung she is, and fair she is, and would be crowned a qeeen,\nWere the king's son at home here with Kathaleen Ny-Houlahan.\n\nSweet and mild would look her face - Oh! none so sweet and mild -\nCould she crush the foes by whom her beauty is reviled;\nWoolen plaids would grace herself and robes of silk her child,\nIf the king's son were living here with Kathaleen Ny-Houlahan.\n\nSore disgrace it is to see the Arbitress of thrones\nVassal to a Saxoneen of cold and hapless bones!\nBitter anguish wrings our souls - with heavy sighs and groans\nWe wait the Young Deliverer of Kathaleen Ny-Houlahan.\n\nLet us pray to Him who holds life's issues in His hands,\nHim who formed the mighty globe, with all his thousand lands;\nGirding them with sea and mountains, rivers deep, and strands,\nTo cast a look of pity upon Kathaleen Ny-Houlahan.\n\nHe, who over sands and waves led Israel along -\nHe who fed, with heavenly bread, that chosen tribe and throng;\nHe who stood by Moses when his foes were fierce and strong,\nMay He show forth His might in saving Kathaleen Ny-Houlahan."}
