{"subject": "The Dead Chase", "text": "A LEGEND.\nA morning of early June,\u2014\nThe wind slept cradled in leaves, \nAnd the throstles were singing a soft low tune,\nIn the ivy under the eaves.\n\nThe silver brooklets murmured\nSweet music in the grass; \nAs the faint tones of an organ \nSwell at the evening mass.\n\nThe velvet sward, like a smooth, green sea,\nGlittered and flashed incessantly,\nWith dewy diamonds of the dawn,\nThrough which went springing the spotted fawn;\nAnd the snake lay idly across the path,\nThat wound amid the vibrating swath.\n\nWithin the deep-green heavy glooms, \nWere beds of orange and crimson blooms, \nWhose sweet perfume and odor stole \nTo the inmost crypts of the grateful soul, \nLike harmonies faintly heard, that seem \nThe sweet, sad memories of a dream. \n\nThe lily grew in the shade,\nAnd the dew-drop lay in its blossom, \nLike a rosy diamond, laid\nOn a virgin's snowy bosom:\n\nThe heart of the crimson rose was blushing\nAt the kisses of the sun; \nLike the cheek of a timid maiden, flushing \nAfter her heart is won.\n\nA wall of cliffs half ringed the dell\nThat sheltered by it slept; \nIn one gray crag a hollowed cell \nNear which a leaping torrent fell, \nAnd a Hermit his vigils kept.\n\nA snowy mountain, close behind,\nShot upward like a flame, \nFrom which with a roar like a mighty wind\nThe headlong river came.\n\nA man once proud and stately,\nNow haggard with despair; \nWhose scared eyes, straining, seem to see \nPar off some great calamity;\nSome terror, darkening all the air,\nAnd armed with nameless agony.\n\nThe woodlark, from her low nest, toward\nThe sky shot, like a dart, \nGladly carolling as she soared\nInto the sky's blue heart.\n\nHe neither heeds, nor hears, nor sees,\nNature to him is dumb, \nAnd all her charming coquetries \nHave odious become.\n\nHis face grows dark; no longer now\nHis soul its dread obeys; \nHis eyes that full of anguish were, \nLike a hunted tiger's blaze.\n\nA sound came clashing past,\nOn the wings of the startled air,\nLike the sound of hoofs that far and fast \nA reckless rider bear.\n\nThe eagle rose from the trackless snows, \nWhere he sat like a king on his throne; \nAnd high he flew, where the sunlight through \nHis dark gray plumage shone; \nUnfolded his heart in a wild scream there,\nAnd fanned with his wings the morning air.\n\nA great steed came, like a mighty rain, \nDown the steep mountain's side; \nThick as a storm his flowing mane,\u2014 \nA horse for a Prince to ride. \nHe stopped before the Hermit's cell, \nLike a statue of stone, immovable.\n\nAnd near this courser stood\nA black hound, with fresh blood\nAbout his feet and upon his jaws; \nHis teeth were long, and sharp, and white, \nLeft by his curling lips in sight;\nHis strong feet fanged with claws.\n\nHe bayed not, and he made no moan, \nBut beside the steed he sat like stone, \nAnd looked in the Hermit's eye: \nWhat want they with the Hermit, \nThat on him thus they stare,\u2014 \nThat hound so fiery-eyed, that steed,\nA stern and silent pair?\n\nThe Hermit shuddered at the sight,\nBut never a word he said; \nOnly his lips became as white\nAs the marble lips of the dead.\n\nSlowly he comes to the steed that waits,\nAs men walk in their sleep; \nAs birds that a serpent fascinates \nInto their jaws do creep.\n\nNow springs he upon the courser's back,\nSaddle and bridle none; \nThe hound has risen, and, baying loud, \nDown the green slope has gone.\n\nUprose the sun; the steed sped on;\nHis hoofs the green sward tore; \nOver stream and hill, through brake and dell,\nWhile the hound bayed on before.\n\nHe came to a river broad and deep;\nIts waves ran high, its banks were steep;\nHe made nor stop nor stay, \nBut plunging in, through the loud din \nOf its rapids stretched away.\n\nOver sharp rocks and hillsides bald, \nWhere the spotted adder sleeps,\u2014 \nThrough forests as green as emerald,\u2014 \nAs the tyrannous tempest sweeps, \n\nAll day, all day, he stretched away, \nAnd the tramp of his hoofs was heard, \nLike an earthquake's foot, when his fiery heart \nIn his adamant eaves is stirred. \n\nAll day, all day, he stretched away,\nTill the gentle moon uprose, \nAnd her soft, pale rays kissed Night's sweet face,\nThe firs and the mountain-snows.\n\nAnd then he was heard careering up\nThat mountain's rocky side; \nThe eternal ice-crags crowned its top, \nAnd the streams that poured from the Giant's cup,\nRushed foaming down his side.\n\nAnd now he follows the black sleuth-hound,\nOn a glacier's frozen sea, \nGrinding to snow with his iron hoof \nIts still, green waves' transparent woof, \nThat since God gave the world its form, \nDefies the lightning and the storm. \n\nMidnight ! midnight! The horse has stopped;\nThe moon stands still, likewise; \nWithout a mist, without a cloud,\nThe stars have shut their eyes.\n\nThe black hound circles round the steed: \nLoud baying,\u2014long and loud; \nThe Hermit sits as pale as Death: \nBut his eye is hard and proud. \n\nA spectre comes athwart the moon;\nHer light gleams through its bones \nA cold wind rushes swiftly by,\nAll eddying with groans.\n\nThe mist of its long yellow hair\nFloats like a ragged cloud; \nWhat does the skeleton, without\nA winding-sheet or shroud?\n\nOut-springs the great black hound again;\nOnce more the scent is won; \nLeap after leap, bay after bay: \nHe and the horse stretch far away; \u2014 \nThey chase the skeleton!\n\nDay comes at last. The night is past,\nBut still the hunt holds on; \nOn hound and horse and spectre shine \nThe red rays of the sun.\n\nSlow, slow as Death, Time draws his breath;\n'Tis a weary space to noon; \nAnd high and high the sun's red eye \nShines, shadowy, like the moon.\n\nA desert stretches every way;\nDawn's crimson and dusk Evening's gray\nRest upon either edge; \nThe wind above it sighs alway; \nLike the sighing of thin sedge.\n\nIn the middle of the desert\nThe horse and hound have stopped;\nThe hunted skeleton, likewise: \nUpon the earth has dropped. \n\nThe hound lies panting by its side: \nWith his red nostrils open wide; \nHis eyes like torches glare: \nThe rider too has left his steed: \nAnd sitteth speechless there.\n\nThrough his long hair the sharp wind moans:\nBut all beside is still; \nHe cannot choose but gaze upon \nThe green bones of the skeleton; \nThrough which the breezes thrill.\n\nAll day they sat in the desert:\nTill the sun slid down the sky: \nAnd in the west his lids of mist\nWere folded over his eye.\n\nThen in the west a shape appeared:\nBetween them and the sun; \nNearer and nearer yet it drew: \nUntil an armed man it grew:\nA mail-clad destrier on.\n\n'What dost thou here with hound and horse:\n'Without a shield or spear? \n'And why dost watch that skeleton: \n'So mossy, green, and sere?\n\n'What dost thou here? Twilight draws near:\n'The weary Day recedes; \n'Night's pilots her dark galley steer \n'Among the trembling stars; while here\n'Thou tellest over thy beads:\u2014\n\n'What dost thou here?' 'Alight and learn:\n''Tis long to mirk midnight: \n'Another sun will set, before\n'Thou seest thy lady bright.\n\n'Alight! I have a tale to tell:\n'It will profit thee to hear:\u2014 \n'That will vibrate in thy memory\n'For many a long, long year.'\n\nThe Knight has leaped from his destrier, \nAnd sits by the Hermit's side, \nAnd listens to a strange, wild tale, \nThere in the desert wide. \n\n'A chase was held, long years ago, \n'On a sunny day of June,' \n'Where a hundred noble horsemen rode, \n'From morning till high noon,\n\n'With wanton glee and revelry,\n'While the hounds before them ran;\n'For, clad in steel, on strong, fleet steeds, \n'They chased an outlawed man.\n\n'For many an hour we chased the game;\n'Hound after hound fell back, \n'Till, man by man, I passed them all,\n'And my strong hound led the pack.\n\n'All night led on the deep-mouthed hound;\n'And all night followed I; \n'The wayward moon went slowly down,\n'The white stars left the sky.\n\n'Uprose the sun; my hound kept on,\n'My good horse faltered not; \n'And when the sun was in the south,\n'I reached this desert spot.\n\n'The Heretic lay here. Ah, God!\n'That I that sight should see! \n'His dead, dead eyes were opened wide,\n'And sadly gazed at me.\n\n'His flesh was torn, his bones were bare,\n'All mangled was his head, \n'And by his side my gaunt sleuth-hound\n'Lay, with his jaws blood-red.\n\n'I sate down by the dead man's side;\n'I had no power to go; \n'Methought that Time also was dead,\n'His feet went by so slow.\n\n'My good hound fawned upon my breast, \n'And kindly too I him caressed;\n'My tears did freely flow; \n'I thought he was my only friend,\n'And God Himself my foe.\n\n'Alas! that weary afternoon!\n'Nor sight nor sound came by; \n'Only the lonesome wind, that through\n'The dead man's hair did sigh.\n\n'The moon uprist, swathed in gray mist,\n'And up the heaven stole, \n'While from the dead man's eyes, her light\n'Pierced to my inmost soul.\n\n'The cold wind swept across the plain,\n'And savored of the sea; \n'It came from my dear, sunny home,\n'Lost like a dream to me.\n\n'The corpse's pale lips then unclosed, \n'His teeth in the moonlight shone,\n'I sat and wept and beat my breast, \n'Till close upon night's noon.\n\n'Out of the chalice of the east, \n'Dark clouds began to rise,\n'Mass upon mass, and broad and fast, \n'Red currents crossed the skies;\n\n'And a moaning sound grew up afar,\n'Like music in the air; \n'It circled round and round the dead,\n'And wailed and murmured there;\n\n'A star slid down from heaven's roof,\n'And nestled by his head; \n'I knew it was his spirit, come\n'With me to watch the Dead.\n\n'And by its light,\u2014 oh, sad, sad sight!\n'Two shadows I could see; \n'One sate on either side, both gazed\n'By turns on him and me.\n\n'A soft light from their snowy hair\n'Fell on his dead, pale face; \n'They were his mother and his sire,\n'Come from their heavenly place, \n'To watch their dead, dead, mangled son,\n'The last of all their race.\n\n'Ah, God! those eyes did search my soul,\n'So calm and sad they were; \n'They were a conscience unto me,\n'And yet I could not stir.\n\n'The dark clouds folded over the moon,\n'Like a wild rushing river, \n'The lightning in the stormy east\n'From bank to bank did quiver.\n\n'Peal upon peal the thunder spoke,\u2014\n'My soul it did rejoice; \n'Me from that death in life it woke,\n'Like an old schoolmate's voice.\n\n'That star still shone, in light or gloom, \n'Like light in a dead man's eye;\n'Those white-haired shadows never stirred, \n'But still sat calmly by.\n\n'Again I had the power to move, \n'And I turned away mine eye; \n'Between me and the clouds I saw \n'A troop come hurrying by. \n\n'With eager course they, man and horse, \n'Like the wind of a tempest pressed; \n'The lightning glittered through their shapes, \n'As it glitters through the mist.\n\n'This shadowy army of the dead,\n'Rushed by me like the wind, \n'Before, the thunder-hounds did bay,\n'And a tempest howled behind.\n\n'And, as they swept by me, I knew\n'Each wan and ghastly face; \n'Oh, God! how changed, since I and they\n'Began that awful chase!\n\n'The corse's spirit-star was quenched,\n'As they came hurtling past, \n'And he uprose as if alive,\n'And before the troop fled fast.\n\n'My hound sprang forward on the track\n'Of the dead, bay after bay, \n'My horse, too, joined the spectral host, \n'And madly dashed away.\n\n'All night the fierce storm roared around,\n'And the thunder's constant roll; \n'But still the gray-haired shadow's voice, \n'Was heard above the tempest's noise, \n'Like moans within the soul.\n\n'And every year, this very night,\n'That chase is held again: \n'Again the skeleton flits fast\n'Before that phantom-train.\n\n'And every year, the very day\n'When we began the chase, \n'No matter where my weary heart\n'Has found a resting-place;\n\n'No matter where I dwell, my horse\n'And hound come back to me; \n'I cannot choose but mount, and thus\n'The horrid hunt have we.\n\n'And here, yea, even here, the chase\n'Fails never to be stopped; \n'And here, this day, these mouldering bones,\n'Moss-grown and green, have dropped.\n\n'I am a wretched, lonely man,\n'No friend, no home, no God; \n'Who many a year, through many a clime,\n'My weary way have trod,\u2014 \n'Alas! I would that I could lay\n'My head beneath the sod!\n\n'The white hair of those parents lies\n'Like a shadow on my soul; \n'In dreams his sightless eyeballs burn\n'My worn heart like a coal.\n\n'I pray to Heaven by night and day,\n'My tears flow like the rain; \n'And yet my useless cries procure\n'No peace: I pray in vain.\n\n'I dream that I was once a child,\n'No bird more blithe and gay, \n'My young heart, like a honey-bee,\n'That hums the live-long day: \n'But now it is a maimed bird,\n'That mourns its life away.'\n\n'God help thee, man! Thy crime was great,\n'But in the eye of Heaven, \n'Repentance may atone for all,\u2014\n'Thy great sin be forgiven.\n\n'So we must dig a grave, and lay \n'These mouldering bones therein,\u2014 \n'Perhaps they there may rest, until \n'The great assize begin. \n\n'And we must pray to God ou high\n'And his beloved Son, \n'To shed their gentle, genial rain\n'Of love thy heart upon.\n\n'So shall thy great sin be atoned,\n'The murdered so forgive; \n'And like the dead man touched by Christ,\n'Thou shalt arise and live.'\n\nWith sword and battle-axe, the twain\nFull earnestly did work, \nWhile round them from the eastern caves\nNight gathered, thick and mirk.\n\nThe moon arose, the gentle stars\nOpened their lustrous eyes; \nThe spirit-star sate near the dead, \nThe shadows came likewise.\n\nBefore the moon fared overhead, \nThe grave was hollowed deep, \nAnd earnestly they cried to Heaven, \nTo pardon and to keep \nThe soul whose sin had been so great, \nAnd its remorse so deep. \n\nThe Hermit kneeled by the skeleton,\nHis thick tears wet. the bones, \nLike echoes from his inmost soul,\nHe uttered earnest moans.\n\nHis tears fell on the spirit-star, \nAnd it blazed like a shaft of fire; \nWhile music stole from the shadows' lips \nLike the murmuring of a lyre. \n\nThey laid the bones within the grave,\nThey piled the sods thereon, \nAnd many a fervent prayer they prayed, \nAfter this toil was done.\n\nThe white star circled thrice around\nThe sodded grave above, \nAnd the Hermit felt a load of woe \nFrom his anguished heart remove; \nFor the light of the shadows' glittering hair \nSank into his soul and nestled there, \nLike a dream of gentle love.\n\nThe moon that stood right overhead, \nWas quenched as 'twere a lamp, \nAnd a cold wind woke, and flitted by, \nIts dark wings chill and damp. \n\nAfar upon the east rang out,\nA wild, fierce, startling bay, \nAnd through the misty fields of foam, \nCareered the wild array.\n\nTill, near the grave, like a rushing wave,\nThe spectral huntsmen halt, \nAnd circling round, each shadowy hound\nBays loudly, as at fault.\n\nThe star, arising from the grave, \nSlowly towards Heaven soared, \nAnd from it a great snowy light \nUpon the Hermit poured. \n\nFaint music from the pale, sad lips \nOf the gray-haired shadows stole, \nAnd filled the mute, delighted air, \nAnd soothed the Hermit's soul. \n\nShrill cries were heard, the air was stirred,\nAs if wings rustled there, \nAnd the spectral huntsmen melted, like \nThin shadows, into air.\n\nThen through the lonely desert rung\nThe \u04d4olian harps of Heaven \nAnd angel-voices sweetly sung, \n'The guilty is forgiven; \n'Calm, calm thy troubled soul to peace! \n'Thy chains of woe are riven.'"}
