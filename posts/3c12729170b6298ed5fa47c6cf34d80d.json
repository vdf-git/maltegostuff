{"subject": "The Tenderness I Love", "text": "I love tenderness. Yea, but it must be strong.\nIt shall not speak soft words nor lisp them.\nIt shall not creep like a young mother,\nTenderly toward the cradle of her babe.\nIt shall not lay hands upon its beloved \nAs a lover would, gently, caressingly.\n\nOh, I love tenderness, but I would not have it\nSing a mournful, aching melody,\nTuned with sympathy. I would not have it\nBare its breast and cradle the smitten upon it,\nSobbing over the wounds.\n\nI love tenderness, but oh, make my tenderness\n\nHave hands that are skillful-turned,\nThat lay in soothe and balm, yet pressing surely\nWith faith behind the pressure of the cure.\nLet my tenderness speak in clarion voice- -\nUnafraid! Let it walk with sure feet\nTo the spot of the fallen, and bending say:\n'Arise, here is my hand,' not:\n'Oh, thou art wounded!'"}
