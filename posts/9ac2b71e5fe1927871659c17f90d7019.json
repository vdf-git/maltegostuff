{"subject": "A War Song To Englishmen", "text": "Prepare, prepare the iron helm of war,\nBring forth the lots, cast in the spacious orb;\nTh' Angel of Fate turns them with mighty hands,\nAnd casts them out upon the darken'd earth!\nPrepare, prepare!\n\nPrepare your hearts for Death's cold hand! prepare\nYour souls for flight, your bodies for the earth;\nPrepare your arms for glorious victory;\nPrepare your eyes to meet a holy God!\nPrepare, prepare!\n\nWhose fatal scroll is that? Methinks 'tis mine!\nWhy sinks my heart, why faltereth my tongue?\nHad I three lives, I'd die in such a cause,\nAnd rise, with ghosts, over the well-fought field.\nPrepare, prepare!\n\nThe arrows of Almighty God are drawn!\nAngels of Death stand in the louring heavens!\nThousands of souls must seek the realms of light,\nAnd walk together on the clouds of heaven!\nPrepare, prepare!\n\nSoldiers, prepare! Our cause is Heaven's cause;\nSoldiers, prepare! Be worthy of our cause:\nPrepare to meet our fathers in the sky:\nPrepare, O troops, that are to fall to-day!\nPrepare, prepare!\n\nAlfred shall smile, and make his harp rejoice;\nThe Norman William, and the learn\u00e8d Clerk,\nAnd Lion Heart, and black-brow'd Edward, with\nHis loyal queen, shall rise, and welcome us!\nPrepare, prepare!"}
