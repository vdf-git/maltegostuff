{"subject": "A Twig Alighted", "text": "A twig alighted on a fence and dozed;\nSo do I sleep.\nThe fruit fell and what have I to do with my trunk,\nWhat with my branch?\nThe fruit fell, the flower is already forgotten,\nThe leaves survive.\nOne day the storm will rage, they will drop.\nTo the ground, dead.\nAfterwards, the nights of dread go on,\nNo rest or sleep for me,\nAlone I thrash about in the dark, smashing\nMy head against my wall.\nAnd again spring blossoms,\nAnd alone I hang from my trunk\nA bare shoot, without bud or flower,\nWithout fruit or leaf."}
