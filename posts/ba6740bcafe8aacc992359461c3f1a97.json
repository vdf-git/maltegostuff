{"subject": "Swift Things are Beautiful", "text": "Swift things are beautiful:\nSwallows and deer,\nAnd lightening that falls\nBright-veined and clear,\nRivers and meteors,\nWind in the wheat,\nThe strong-withered horse,\nThe runner's sure feet.\n\nAnd slow things are beautiful:\nThe closing of day,\nThe pause of the wave\nThat curves downward to spray,\nThe ember that crumbles,\nThe opening flower,\nAnd the ox that moves on\nIn the quiet of power."}
