{"subject": "Solatium", "text": "Comes the broken flower -\nComes the cheated maid -\nThough the tempest lower,\nRain and cloud will fade!\nTake, O maid, these posies:\nThough thy beauty rare\nShame the blushing roses,\nThey are passing fair!\nWear the flowers till they fade;\nHappy be thy life, O maid!\n\nO'er the season vernal,\nTime may cast a shade;\nSunshine, if eternal,\nMakes the roses fade:\nTime may do his duty;\nLet the thief alone -\nWinter hath a beauty\nThat is all his own.\nFairest days are sun and shade:\nHappy be thy life, O maid!"}
