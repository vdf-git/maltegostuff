{"subject": "Faith Matheny", "text": "At first you will know not what they mean,\nAnd you may never know,\nAnd we may never tell you: --\nThese sudden flashes in your soul,\nLike lambent lightning on snowy clouds\nAt midnight when the moon is full.\nThey come in solitude, or perhaps\nYou sit with your friend, and all at once\nA silence falls on speech, and his eyes\nWithout a flicker glow at you: --\nYou two have seen the secret together,\nHe sees it in you, and you in him.\nAnd there you sit thrilling lest the Mystery\nStand before you and strike you dead\nWith a splendor like the sun's.\nBe brave, all souls who have such visions!\nAs your body's alive as mine is dead,\nYou're catching a little whiff of the ether\nReserved for God Himself."}
