{"subject": "In The City", "text": "Oh ! City girls are pale-like,\nAnd proud-like, and cold-like.\nAnd nineteen out of twenty\nHave never been our way.\nI tells them of the tall hills.\nThe green hills, the old hills,\nWhere hawthorns are a-blossoming,\nAnd thrushes call all day.\n\nOh ! London is a fine place,\nA big place, a rich place.\nWhere nineteen out of twenty\nOf all the girls are fair.\nBut well I knows a white road,\nA long road, a straight road.\nThat leads me into Bosbury ;\nI'm wishing I was there !"}
