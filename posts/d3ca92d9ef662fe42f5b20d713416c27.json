{"subject": "Heart Be Still, The Sun Goes Down", "text": "Stille, hjerte, sol g\u00e5r ned\n(Heart be still, the sun goes down)\n\nHeart; be still, the sun goes down,\nSmiling over the meadows,\nSheep and cows are homeward bound\nThrough the deepening shadows,\nHeart, be still, be still, the sun goes down.\n\nSilence falls on lanes and lea,\nRestless day is over;\nOne belated bumblebee\nDrones among the clover,\nHeart, be still, be still, the sun goes down.\n\nSoftly now the haze is stirred\nFrom the lowlands lifting;\nOver the treetops skims a bird,\nFleecy clouds are drifting,\nHeart, be still, be still, the sun goes down.\n\nFar to east the windows gleam\nRed with flashes blinding;\nSunset coloured flows a stream\nThrough green pastures winding\nHeart, be still, be still, sun goes down."}
