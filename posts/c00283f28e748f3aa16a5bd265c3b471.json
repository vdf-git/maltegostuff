{"subject": "The Lost Ship", "text": "Come you up from southward, oh, come you there - away?\nAnd saw you not my ship there that's late now many a day?\nAnd touched you ne'er a port where she came a-sailing thither?\nWhere's the barque \nAurora\nand all her people with her?\n\nAh, good-bye and fare you well now, ship and sailor:\nAh, good-bye, for never harbour more shall hail her:\nAsk the unsleeping drift if still it lifts her westing,\nOr the Tuscarora Deeps if there she's resting.\n\nHome, come home: it is no use at all to linger:\nNever will be tide so late that it will bring her:\nSalt like tears the scud is, cold the sea tides streaming:\nNever will you greet your man but in your dreaming,\n\nAsk the roaring Norther: ask the berg that broke her:\nAsk the growlers of the Horn where last they spoke her.\nAsk the seas that, pouring through the splintered hatches,\nLast relieved for good and all her labouring watches.\n\nAsk the crazy gale that, hither-thither shifting,\nSnatched the last tired chantey stave their lips were lifting.\nAsk the Austral lights that in their dances reeling\nMocked across the empty skies her flares' appealing.\n\nAsk the lonely dawn that, scarlet, silent, splendid,\nLooked across the world and found the fight was ended.\nAsk the wind and wave that bruised and broke and shook her . . .\nAnd the sea's great silence at the last that took her."}
