{"subject": "Epimetheus, Or The Poet's Afterthought. (Birds Of Passage. Flight The First)", "text": "Have I dreamed? or was it real,\nWhat I saw as in a vision,\nWhen to marches hymeneal\nIn the land of the Ideal\nMoved my thought o'er Fields Elysian? \n\nWhat! are these the guests whose glances\nSeemed like sunshine gleaming round me?\nThese the wild, bewildering fancies,\nThat with dithyrambic dances\nAs with magic circles bound me? \n\nAh! how cold are their caresses!\nPallid cheeks, and haggard bosoms!\nSpectral gleam their snow-white dresses,\nAnd from loose, dishevelled tresses\nFall the hyacinthine blossoms! \n\nO my songs! whose winsome measures\nFilled my heart with secret rapture!\nChildren of my golden leisures!\nMust even your delights and pleasures\nFade and perish with the capture? \n\nFair they seemed, those songs sonorous,\nWhen they came to me unbidden;\nVoices single, and in chorus,\nLike the wild birds singing o'er us\nIn the dark of branches hidden. \n\nDisenchantment! Disillusion!\nMust each noble aspiration\nCome at last to this conclusion,\nJarring discord, wild confusion,\nLassitude, renunciation? \n\nNot with steeper fall nor faster,\nFrom the sun's serene dominions,\nNot through brighter realms nor vaster,\nIn swift ruin and disaster,\nIcarus fell with shattered pinions! \n\nSweet Pandora! dear Pandora!\nWhy did mighty Jove create thee\nCoy as Thetis, fair as Flora,\nBeautiful as young Aurora,\nIf to win thee is to hate thee? \n\nNo, not hate thee! for this feeling\nOf unrest and long resistance\nIs but passionate appealing,\nA prophetic whisper stealing\nO'er the chords of our existence. \n\nHim whom thou dost once enamour,\nThou, beloved, never leavest;\nIn life's discord, strife, and clamor,\nStill he feels thy spell of glamour;\nHim of Hope thou ne'er bereavest. \n\nWeary hearts by thee are lifted,\nStruggling souls by thee are strengthened,\nClouds of fear asunder rifted,\nTruth from falsehood cleansed and sifted,\nLives, like days in summer, lengthened! \n\nTherefore art thou ever dlearer,\nO my Sibyl, my deceiver!\nFor thou makest each mystery clearer,\nAnd the unattained seems nearer,\nWhen thou fillest my heart with fever! \n\nMuse of all the Gifts and Graces!\nThough the fields around us wither,\nThere are ampler realms and spaces,\nWhere no foot has left its traces:\nLet us turn and wander thither!"}
