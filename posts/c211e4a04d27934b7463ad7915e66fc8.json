{"subject": "Sonnet Xx.", "text": "The piteous sobs that choke the Virgin's breath\nFor him, the fair betrothed Youth, who les\nCold in the narrow dwelling, or the cries\nWith which a Mother wails her Darling's death,\nThese from our Nature's common impulse spring\nUnblamed, unpraised; but o'er the piled earth,\nWhich hides the sheeted corse of gray-haired Worth,\nIf droops the soaring Youth with slackened wing;\nIf he recall in saddest minstrelsy \nEach tenderness bestowed, each truth impressed;\nSuch Grief is Reason, Virtue, Piety!\nAnd from the Almighty Father shall descend\nComforts on his late Evening, whose young breast\nMourns with no transient love the aged friend."}
