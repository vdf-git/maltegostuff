{"subject": "The Queen's Song", "text": "Had I the power\nTo Midas given of old\nTo touch a flower\nAnd leave the petals gold\nI then might touch thy face,\nDelightful boy,\nAnd leave a metal grace,\nA graven joy.\nThus would I slay, -\nAh, desperate device!\nThe vital day\nThat trembles in thine eyes,\nAnd let the red lips close\nWhich sang so well,\nAnd drive away the rose\nTo leave a shell.\n\nThen I myself,\nRising austere and dumb\nOn the hight shelf\nOf my half-lighted room,\nWould place the shining bust\nAnd wait alone,\nUntil I was but dust,\nBuried unknown.\n\nThus in my love\nFor nations yet unborn,\nI would remove\nFrom our two lives the morn,\nAnd muse on loveliness\nIn mine armchair,\nContent should Time confess\nHow sweet you were."}
