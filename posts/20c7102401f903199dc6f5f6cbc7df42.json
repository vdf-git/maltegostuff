{"subject": "Anniversary Tribute", "text": "We gather here to honor them\n Respecting love that gave us birth.\n We are the branches of that stem\n Who wish them long life on the earth.\n\n It's not just what our law decrees\n That calls us to bestow this praise;\n But what we feel on bended knees\n In gratitude for all their days.\n\n We can't repay our loving home\n Nor wisdom laced with aiming high.\n We can recall the strength they've shown\n And courage just enough to try.\n\n Lord, grant this union as before\n Has two hearts beat in harmony.\n The years fulfilled and many more.\n Their lives with us... our treasury!"}
