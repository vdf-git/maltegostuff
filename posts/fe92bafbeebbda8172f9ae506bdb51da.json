{"subject": "On A Virtuous Young Gentlewoman That Died Suddenly", "text": "SHE who to Heaven more Heaven doth annex, \nWhose lowest thought was above all our sex, \nAccounted nothing death but t' be reprieved, \nAnd died as free from sickness as she lived. \nOthers are dragg'd away, or must be driven, \nShe only saw her time and stept to Heaven; \nWhere seraphims view all her glories o'er, \nAs one return'd that had been there before. \nFor while she did this lower world adorn, \nHer body seem'd rather assumed than born; \nSo rarified, advanced, so pure and whole, \nThat body might have been another's soul; \nAnd equally a miracle it were \nThat she could die, or that she could live here."}
