{"subject": "The Art Of William Keith", "text": "HERE, vast and awful, the Sierras rear \nTheir everlasting summits to the sky; \nThe mighty waters of the sunset lie \nIn all their changing opalescence; here\nThe brooding melancholy of the sere,\nDun autumn woods; the laughing leafery \nOf budding boughs, blending each tender dye \nWith the lush green of the awakening year.\nThis is not painted canvas, \u2014 this is life, \nCreation, earth, in all her varying moods! \nThese fields a-thrill with motion and with light,\nThese forest-ways, with dream and mystery rife! \nHere nature's heart throbs through the solitudes!\nHere nature's soul looks from the mystic height."}
