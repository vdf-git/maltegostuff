{"subject": "Linoz Isidoz", "text": "Lo! I lament. Fallen is the sixfold Star:\nSlain is Asar.\nO twinned with me in the womb of Night!\nO son of my bowels to the Lord of Light!\nO man of mine that hast covered me\nFrom the shame of my virginity!\nWhere art thou? Is it not Apep thy brother,\nThe snake in my womb that am thy mother,\nThat hath slain thee by violence girt with guile,\nAnd scattered thy limbs on the Nile?\n\nLo! I lament. I have forged a whirling Star:\nI seek Asar.\nO Nepti, sister! Arise in the dusk\nFrom thy chamber of mystery and musk!\nCome with me, though weary the way,\nTo bring back his life to the rended clay!\nSee! are not these the hands that wove\nDelight, and these the arms that strove\nWith me? And these the feet, the thighs\nThat were lovely in mine eyes?\n\nLo! IO lament. I gather in my car\nThine head, Asar. \nAnd this -is this not the trunk he rended?\nBut -oh! oh! oh! -the task transcended,\nWhere is the holy idol that stood\nFor the god of thy queen's beatitude?\nHere is the tent -but where is the pole?\nHere is the body -but where is the soul?\nNepti, sister, the work is undone\nFor lack of the needed One!\n\nLo! I lament. There is no god so far\nAs mine Asar!\nThere is no hope, none, in the corpse, in the tomb.\nBut these -what are these that war in my womb?\nThere is vengeance and triumph at last of Maat\nIn Ra-Hoor-Khut and in Hoor-pa-Kraat!\nTwins they shall rise; being twins they are one,\nThe Lord of the Sword and the Son of the Sun!\nSilence, coeval colleague of the Voice,\nThe plumes of Amoun -rejoice!\n\nLo! I rejoice. I heal the sanguine scar\nOf slain Asar.\nI was the Past, Nature the Mother.\nHe was the Present, Man my brother.\nLook to the Future, the Child -oh paean\nThe Child that is crowned in the Lion-Aeon!\nThe sea-dawns surge an billow and break\nBeneath the scourge of the Star and the Snake.\nTo my lord I have borne in my womb deep-vaulted\nThis babe for ever exalted."}
