{"subject": "Piazza Piece", "text": "-- I am a gentleman in a dustcoat trying\nTo make you hear. Your ears are soft and small\nAnd listen to an old man not at all,\nThey want the young men's whispering and sighing.\nBut see the roses on your trellis dying\nAnd hear the spectral singing of the moon;\nFor I must have my lovely lady soon,\nI am a gentleman in a dustcoat trying.\n\n-- I am a lady young in beauty waiting\nUntil my truelove comes, and then we kiss.\nBut what grey man among the vines is this\nWhose words are dry and faint as in a dream?\nBack from my trellis, Sir, before I scream !\nI am a lady young in beauty waiting."}
