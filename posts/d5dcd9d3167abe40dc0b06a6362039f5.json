{"subject": "Lilian Stewart", "text": "I was the daughter of Lambert Hutchins,\nBorn in a cottage near the grist-mill,\nReared in the mansion there on the hill,\nWith its spires, bay-windows, and roof of slate.\nHow proud my mother was of the mansion!\nHow proud of father's rise in the world!\nAnd how my father loved and watched us,\nAnd guarded our happiness.\nBut I believe the house was a curse,\nFor father's fortune was little beside it;\nAnd when my husband found he had married\nA girl who was really poor,\nHe taunted me with the spires,\nAnd called the house a fraud on the world,\nA treacherous lure to young men, raising hopes\nOf a dowry not to be had;\nAnd a man while selling his vote\nShould get enough from the people's betrayal\nTo wall the whole of his family in.\nHe vexed my life till I went back home\nAnd lived like an old maid till I died,\nKeeping house for father."}
