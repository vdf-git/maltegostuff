{"subject": "A King In Exile", "text": "O THE Queen may keep her golden\n   Crown and sceptre of command!\nI would give them both twice over\n   To be King of Babyland. \nSure, it is a wondrous country\n   Where the beanstalks grow apace,\nAnd so very near the moon is\n   You could almost stroke her face. \n\nAnd the dwellers in that country\n   Hold in such esteem their King,\nThey believe that if he chooses\n   He can do\u2014just anything! \n\nAnd, although his regal stature\n   May be only four-feet-ten,\nThink him tallest, strongest, bravest,\n   Noblest, wisest, best of men. \n\nAh, how fondly I remember\n   The good time serene and fair,\nIn the bygone years when I, too,\n   Was a reigning monarch there! \n\nBut my subjects they discrowned me\n   When they\u2019d older, colder, grown;\nAnd they took away my sceptre,\n   And upset my royal throne. \n\nYet, although a King in Exile,\n   Without subjects to command,\nI am glad at heart to think I\n   Once was King of Babyland."}
