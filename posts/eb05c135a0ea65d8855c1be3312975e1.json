{"subject": "France In '93", "text": "Ark! the onward heavy tread\nHark! the voices rude\n\u2019Tis the famished cry for Bread\nFrom a wildered multitude.\n\nThey come! They come!\nPoint the cannon\u2014roll the drum;\nThousands wail and weep with hunger\nFaster let your soldiers number.\nSword, and gun, and bayonet\nA famished people\u2019s cries have met.\n\nHark! the onward heavy tread\nHark! the voices rude\u2014\n\u2019Tis the famished cry for Bread\nFrom an armed multitude.\nThey come! They come!\nNot with meek submission\u2019s hum.\nBloody trophy they have won,\nGhastly glares it in the sun\nGory head on lifted pike.\nHa! they weep not now, but strike.\n\nYe, the deaf ones to their cries\nYe, who scorned their agonies\n\u2019Tis no longer prayers for bread\nShriek in your ears the famish\u00e9d;\nBut wildly, fiercely, peal on peal,\nResoundeth\u2014Down with the Bastile!\nCan ye tame a people now?\nTry them\u2014flatter, promise, vow,\nSwear their wrongs shall be redressed\nBut patience\u2014time will do the rest;\nSwear they shall one day be fed\nHark! the People\u2014Dead for Dead!\n\nCalculating statesmen, quail;\nProud aristocrat, grow pale;\nSavage sounds that deathly song:\nDown with tyrants! Down with wrong!\nBlindly now they wreak revenge\nHow rudely do a mob avenge!\n\nWhat! coronetted Prince of Peer,\nWill not the base\u2010born slavelings fear?\nSooth, their cry is somewhat stern:\nAristocrats, \u00e0 la Lanterne!\nGhastly fruit their lances bear\nNoble heads with streaming hair;\nDiadem and kingly crown\nStrike the famine\u2010stricken down.\nNow, the People\u2019s work is done\nOn they stride o\u2019er prostrate throne;\nRoyal blood of King and Queen\nStreameth from the guillotine;\nWildly on the people goeth,\nReaping what the noble soweth.\nLittle dreamed he, prince or peer,\nOf who should be his heritor.\nHunger now, at last, is sated\nIn halls where once it wailed and waited;\nWild Justice fiercely rives the laws\nWhich failed to right a people\u2019s cause.\nOn that human ocean floweth,\nWhither stops it no one knoweth\nSurge the wild waves in their strength\nAgainst all chartered rights at length\nThrone, and King, and Noble fall;\nBut the People\u2014they hold Carnival!"}
