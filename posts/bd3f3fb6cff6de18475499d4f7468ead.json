{"subject": "A Dedication", "text": "Expect na, sir, in this narration, \nA fleechin, fleth'rin Dedication, \nTo roose you up, an' ca' you guid, \nAn' sprung o' great an' noble bluid, \nBecause ye're surnam'd like His Grace- \nPerhaps related to the race: \nThen, when I'm tir'd-and sae are ye, \nWi' mony a fulsome, sinfu' lie, \nSet up a face how I stop short, \nFor fear your modesty be hurt. \n\nThis may do-maun do, sir, wi' them wha \nMaun please the great folk for a wamefou; \nFor me! sae laigh I need na bow, \nFor, Lord be thankit, I can plough; \nAnd when I downa yoke a naig, \nThen, Lord be thankit, I can beg; \nSae I shall say-an' that's nae flatt'rin- \nIt's just sic Poet an' sic Patron. \n\nThe Poet, some guid angel help him, \nOr else, I fear, some ill ane skelp him! \nHe may do weel for a' he's done yet, \nBut only-he's no just begun yet. \n\nThe Patron (sir, ye maun forgie me; \nI winna lie, come what will o' me), \nOn ev'ry hand it will allow'd be, \nHe's just-nae better than he should be. \n\nI readily and freely grant, \nHe downa see a poor man want; \nWhat's no his ain, he winna tak it; \nWhat ance he says, he winna break it; \nOught he can lend he'll no refus't, \nTill aft his guidness is abus'd; \nAnd rascals whiles that do him wrang, \nEv'n that, he does na mind it lang; \nAs master, landlord, husband, father, \nHe does na fail his part in either. \n\nBut then, nae thanks to him for a'that; \nNae godly symptom ye can ca' that; \nIt's naething but a milder feature \nOf our poor, sinfu' corrupt nature: \nYe'll get the best o' moral works, \n'Mang black Gentoos, and pagan Turks, \nOr hunters wild on Ponotaxi, \nWha never heard of orthodoxy. \nThat he's the poor man's friend in need, \nThe gentleman in word and deed, \nIt's no thro' terror of damnation; \nIt's just a carnal inclination. \n\nMorality, thou deadly bane, \nThy tens o' thousands thou hast slain! \nVain is his hope, whase stay an' trust is \nIn moral mercy, truth, and justice! \n\nNo-stretch a point to catch a plack: \nAbuse a brother to his back; \nSteal through the winnock frae a whore, \nBut point the rake that taks the door; \nBe to the poor like ony whunstane, \nAnd haud their noses to the grunstane; \nPly ev'ry art o' legal thieving; \nNo matter-stick to sound believing. \n\nLearn three-mile pray'rs, an' half-mile graces, \nWi' weel-spread looves, an' lang, wry faces; \nGrunt up a solemn, lengthen'd groan, \nAnd damn a' parties but your own; \nI'll warrant they ye're nae deceiver, \nA steady, sturdy, staunch believer. \n\nO ye wha leave the springs o' Calvin, \nFor gumlie dubs of your ain delvin! \nYe sons of Heresy and Error, \nYe'll some day squeel in quaking terror, \nWhen Vengeance draws the sword in wrath. \nAnd in the fire throws the sheath; \nWhen Ruin, with his sweeping besom, \nJust frets till Heav'n commission gies him; \nWhile o'er the harp pale Misery moans, \nAnd strikes the ever-deep'ning tones, \nStill louder shrieks, and heavier groans! \n\nYour pardon, sir, for this digression: \nI maist forgat my Dedication; \nBut when divinity comes 'cross me, \nMy readers still are sure to lose me. \n\nSo, sir, you see 'twas nae daft vapour; \nBut I maturely thought it proper, \nWhen a' my works I did review, \nTo dedicate them, sir, to you: \nBecause (ye need na tak it ill), \nI thought them something like yoursel'. \n\nThen patronize them wi' your favor, \nAnd your petitioner shall ever- \nI had amaist said, ever pray, \nBut that's a word I need na say; \nFor prayin, I hae little skill o't, \nI'm baith dead-sweer, an' wretched ill o't; \nBut I'se repeat each poor man's pray'r, \nThat kens or hears about you, sir- \n\n\"May ne'er Misfortune's gowling bark, \nHowl thro' the dwelling o' the clerk! \nMay ne'er his genrous, honest heart, \nFor that same gen'rous spirit smart! \nMay Kennedy's far-honour'd name \nLang beet his hymeneal flame, \nTill Hamiltons, at least a dizzen, \nAre frae their nuptial labours risen: \nFive bonie lasses round their table, \nAnd sev'n braw fellows, stout an' able, \nTo serve their king an' country weel, \nBy word, or pen, or pointed steel! \nMay health and peace, with mutual rays, \nShine on the ev'ning o' his days; \nTill his wee, curlie John's ier-oe, \nWhen ebbing life nae mair shall flow, \nThe last, sad, mournful rites bestow!\" \n\nI will not wind a lang conclusion, \nWith complimentary effusion; \nBut, whilst your wishes and endeavours \nAre blest with Fortune's smiles and favours, \nI am, dear sir, with zeal most fervent, \nYour much indebted, humble servant. \n\nBut if (which Pow'rs above prevent) \nThat iron-hearted carl, Want, \nAttended, in his grim advances, \nBy sad mistakes, and black mischances, \nWhile hopes, and joys, and pleasures fly him, \nMake you as poor a dog as I am, \nYour humble servant then no more; \nFor who would humbly serve the poor? \nBut, by a poor man's hopes in Heav'n! \nWhile recollection's pow'r is giv'n- \nIf, in the vale of humble life, \nThe victim sad of fortune's strife, \nI, thro' the tender-gushing tear, \nShould recognise my master dear; \nIf friendless, low, we meet together, \nThen, sir, your hand-my Friend and Brother!"}
