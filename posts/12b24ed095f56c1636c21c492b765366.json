{"subject": "Amaturus", "text": "Somewhere beneath the sun,\nThese quivering heart-strings prove it,\nSomewhere there must be one\nMade for this soul, to move it;\nSome one that hides her sweetness\nFrom neighbours whom she slights,\nNor can attain completeness,\nNor give her heart its rights;\nSome one whom I could court\nWith no great change of manner,\nStill holding reason's fort,\nThough waving fancy's banner;\nA lady, not so queenly\nAs to disdain my hand,\nYet born to smile serenely\nLike those that rule the land;\nNoble, but not too proud;\nWith soft hair simply folded,\nAnd bright face crescent-browed,\nAnd throat by Muses moulded;\nAnd eyelids lightly falling\nOn little glistening seas,\nDeep-calm, when gales are brawling,\nThough stirred by every breeze:\nSwift voice, like flight of dove\nThrough minister arches floating,\nWith sudden turns, when love\nGets overnear to doting;\nKeen lips, that shape soft sayings\nLike crystals of the snow,\nWith pretty half-betrayings\nOf things one may not know;\nFair hand, whose touches thrill,\nLike golden rod of wonder,\nWhich Hermes wields at will\nSpirit and flesh to sunder;\nLight foot, to press the stirrup\nIn fearlessness and glee,\nOr dance, till finches chirrup,\nAnd stars sink to the sea.\n\nForth, Love, and find this maid,\nWherever she be hidden:\nSpeak, Love, be not afraid,\nBut plead as thou art bidden;\nAnd say, that he who taught thee\nHis yearning want and pain,\nToo dearly, dearly bought thee\nTo part with thee in vain."}
