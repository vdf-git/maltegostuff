{"subject": "The Town Between The Hills", "text": "The further the little girl leaped and ran,\nThe further she longed to be;\nThe white, white fields of jonquil flowers\nDanced up as high as her knee\nAnd flashed and sparkled before her eyes\nUntil she could hardly see.\nSo into the wood went she.\n\n     It was quiet in the wood,\nIt was solemn and grave;\nA sound like a wave\nSighed in the tree-tops\nAnd then sighed no more.\nBut she was brave,\nAnd the sky showed through\nA bird's-egg blue,\nAnd she saw\nA tiny path that was running away\nOver the hills to--who can say?\nShe ran, too.\nBut then the path broke,\nThen the path ended\nAnd wouldn't be mended.\n\n     A little old man\nSat on the edge,\nHugging the hedge.\nHe had a fire\nAnd two eggs in a pan\nAnd a paper poke\nOf pepper and salt;\nSo she came to a halt\nTo watch and admire:\nCunning and nimble was he!\n\"May I help, if I can, little old man?\"\n\"Bravo!\" he said,\n\"You may dine with me.\nI've two old eggs\nFrom two white hens\nand a loaf from a kind ladie:\nSome fresh nutmegs,\nSome cutlet ends\nIn pink and white paper frills:\nAnd--I've--got\nA little hot-pot\nFrom the town between the hills.\"\n\n     He nodded his head\nAnd made her a sign\nTo sit under the spray\nOf a trailing vine.\n\n     But when the little girl joined her hands\nAnd said the grace she had learned to say,\nThe little old man gave two dreadful squeals\nAnd she just saw the flash of his smoking heels\nAs he tumbled, tumbled,\nWith his two old eggs\nFrom two white hens,\nHis loaf from a kind ladie,\nThe fresh nutmegs,\nThe cutlet-ends\nIn the pink and white paper frills.\nAnd away rumbled\nThe little hot-pot,\nSo much too hot,\nFrom the ton between the hills."}
