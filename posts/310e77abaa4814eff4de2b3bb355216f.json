{"subject": "Fastrada's Ring", "text": "'Stretch out thy hand, insatiate Time!\nKeeper of keys, restore to me\nSome gift that in the gray Earth's prime\nHer happy children held of thee;\nSome signet of that mystery\nThy footsteps trample into death,\nSome score of that strange harmony\nThat sings in every breath.'\n\nSo sung I on an autumn-day,\nSitting in silence, golden, clear,\nWhen even the mild winds seemed to pray\nBeside the slowly dying year,\nAnd the old conqueror stopped to hear;\nFor, like the echo of a bell,\nI heard him speak, in accents clear:\n'Choose! and thy wise choice tell!'\n\nThen all my vanishing desires,\nThe threads of hope and joy and pain,\nLong burned in life's consuming fires,\nCame glittering into life again,\nAnd, gathered as a summer rain\nInto the rainbow's bended wing,\nCried, with one voice of longing vain:\n'Give me Fastrada's ring!\n\n'Give me that talisman of peace\nShe wore upon her finger white,\nThen shall the weary visions cease,\nThat haunt me all the lingering night;\nThe world shall blossom with delight,\nAnd birds of heaven about me sing;\nAh! fill these darkened eyes with light!\nGive me Fastrada's ring!\n\n'Give me no jewels from thy store,\nNo learned scrolls, no gems of art;\nMy eager wishes grasp at more:\nSleep for a worn and wretched heart;\nA draught to melt these lips apart,\nSealed with such thirst as death-pains bring;\nLove,-life's sole rest and better part,\nGive me Fastrada's ring!'"}
