{"subject": "A Story About Chicken Soup", "text": "In my grandmother's house there was always chicken soup\nAnd talk of the old country\u2014mud and boards,\nPoverty,\nThe snow falling down the necks of lovers.\n\nNow and then, out of her savings\nShe sent them a dowry. Imagine\nThe rice-powdered faces!\nAnd the smell of the bride, like chicken soup.\n\nBut the Germans killed them.\nI know it's in bad taste to say it,\nBut it's true. The Germans killed them all.\n\n                            *\n\nIn the ruins of Berchtesgaden\nA child with yellow hair\nRan out of a doorway.\n\nA German girl-child\u2014\nCuckoo, all skin and bones\u2014\nNot even enough to make chicken soup.\nShe sat by the stream and smiled.\n\nThen as we splashed in the sun\nShe laughed at us.\nWe had killed her mechanical brothers,\nSo we forgave her.\n\n                            *\n\nThe sun is shining.\nThe shadows of the lovers have disappeared.\nThey are all eyes; they have some demand on me\u2014\nThey want me to be more serious than I want to be.\n\nThey want me to stick in their mudhole\nWhere no one is elegant.\nThey want me to wear old clothes,\nThey want me to be poor, to sleep in a room with many others\u2014\n\nNot to walk in the painted sunshine\nTo a summer house,\nBut to live in the tragic world forever."}
