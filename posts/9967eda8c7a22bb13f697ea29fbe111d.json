{"subject": "Beyond The Clique", "text": "Dignity of knife in hope or fright\ncuts the outer edge of desire.Huddled\nanxiety oversees the fringe bites\n\nof comforts. The child you abandoned\non road becomes a tree I nurtured.\nA leafy town grows in the calyx of capricious\n\nimpermanence. Calisthenics permeates the\nvibrations in foxgloves.Dragonflies become\nvulnerable in feckless shadows of eyes. The\n\nlithe body metastasizes into a mausoleum, \nyou adore. A tiger mauls a gift of bed.\nYour whispers start hissing for intrusion.\n\nA pilgrim of negation raises a non-belief, \ncreates a stimulus to bestow an endless\npain in summation of all night."}
