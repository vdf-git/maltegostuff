{"subject": "Sonnet Cclxxxvi:", "text": "I touched the limit of supremest bliss, \nKnew joy's whole secret on this golden day; \nWhen in my arms my panting darling lay, \nDaring my lips with lingering kiss on kiss. \nBrand it upon my heart! Let me not miss \nA single memory, not the faintest ray \nOf that which made divine my burning clay, \nAnd heaven a fancy to a world like this! \nNay, day of glory, bury in the past \nThy radiant head! lest in the coming night \nThou sting my exiled soul with thoughts too bright! \nOr else, O wondrous vision, onward cast \nThyself into the future's dreadful vast, \nAnd o'er and o'er renew today's delight."}
