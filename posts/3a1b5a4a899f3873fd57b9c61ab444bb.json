{"subject": "Adam", "text": "On man, in his own image made,\nHow much did GOD bestow?\nThe whole creation homage paid,\nAnd owned him LORD, below! \n\nHe dwelt in Eden's garden, stored\nWith sweets for every sense;\nAnd there with his descending LORD\nHe walked in confidence. \n\nBut O! by sin how quickly changed!\nHis honour forfeited,\nHis heart, from God and truth, estranged,\nHis conscience filled with dread! \n\nNow from his Maker's voice he flees,\nWhich was before his joy:\nAnd thinks to hide, amidst the trees,\nFrom an All-seeing eye. \n\nCompelled to answer to his name,\nWith stubbornness and pride\nHe cast, on God himself, the blame,\nNor once for mercy cried. \n\nBut grace, unasked, his heart subdued\nAnd all his guilt forgave;\nBy faith, the promised seed he viewed,\nAnd felt his pow'r to save. \n\nThus we ourselves would justify,\nThough we the Law transgress;\nLike him, unable to deny,\nUnwilling to confess. \n\nBut when by faith the sinner sees\nA pardon bought with blood;\nThen he forsakes his foolish pleas,\nAnd gladly turns to God."}
