{"subject": "To Weep Because", "text": "To weep because a glorious sun has set\nWhich the next morn shall gild the east again;\nTo mourn that mighty strengths must yield to fate\nWhich by that force a double strength attain;\nTo shrink from pain without whose friendly strife\nJoy could not be, to make a terror of death\nWho smiling beckons us to farther life,\nAnd is a bridge for the persistent breath;\nDespair and anguish and the tragic grief \nOf dry set eyes, or such disastrous tears\nAs rend the heart, though meant for its relief, \nAnd all man's ghastly company of fears\nAre born of folly that believes the span\nOf life the limit of immortal man."}
