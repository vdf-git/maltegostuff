{"subject": "There's Got To Be A Morning After", "text": "I heard it once, smoothed-out\nby gallons of coffee,\nchest husking like a plow\nand pulled it into a basement.\nCardigan-wrapped the next morning\nand only then was it true, only then\nwas I so hungry I could eat at the roots of it,\n\nand lay down like a napping aristocrat\ndreaming of pendulums\npotbellied, empurpled,\npissing outside, and my\nboombox played it again, its notes\nencircled by my poor shy ghosts\nmade quiet speeches to the wind\nsaluted this song's toasting."}
