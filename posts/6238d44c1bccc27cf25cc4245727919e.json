{"subject": "Americanisation", "text": "Britannia needs no Boulevards,\n No spaces wide and gay:\nHer march was through the crooked streets\n Along the narrow way.\nNor looks she where, New York's seduction,\nThe Broadway leadeth to destruction.\n\nBritannia needs no Cafes:\n If Coffee needs must be,\nIts place should be the Coffee-house\n Where Johnson growled for Tea;\nBut who can hear that human mountain\nGrowl for an ice-cream soda-fountain?\n\nShe needs no Russian Theatrey\n Mere Father strangles Mother,\nIn scenes where all the characters\n And colours kill each other--\nHer boast is freedom had by halves,\nAnd Britons never shall be Slavs.\n\nBut if not hers the Dance of Death,\n Great Dostoievsky's dance,\nAnd if the things most finely French\n Are better done in France--\nMight not Americanisation\nBe best applied to its own nation?\n\nEre every shop shall be a store\n And every Trade a Trust . . .\nLo, many men in many lands\n Know when their cause is just.\nThere will be quite a large attendance\nWhen we Declare our Independence."}
