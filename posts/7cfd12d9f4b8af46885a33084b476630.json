{"subject": "Farragut", "text": "Grand in his dreamless sleep our Admiral lies, \nThe brave heart still, so fondly loved and blest; \nThe light gone forth from those prophetic eyes, \nThe guiding hand at rest. \n\nHis star in glory set \u2014 his great work done \nMuffle the drum, and toll the solemn bell; \nAnd let the deep voice of the minute-gun \nA people's sorrow tell. \n\nA friend who failed not in the darkest hour; \nA valiant soul who at his Country's call \nBattled with Treason born of hate and power. \nAnd triumphed over all. \n\nOne noble life the less for Heaven to take; \nOne hero more passed from this land of ours; \u2014 \nLay fairest garlands on his bier, and make \nDeath beautiful with flowers. \n\nA Nation's heart shall be his funeral urn, \nWhile time shall add new lustre to his fame \nAnd Freedom's fires with holier light shall burn, \nWhere'er is breathed his name."}
