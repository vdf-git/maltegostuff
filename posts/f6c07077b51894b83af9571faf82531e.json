{"subject": "Who Clad Your Delicate Frame In Red", "text": "Who clad your delicate frame in red,\nO bright lightning, let me gaze\nAt you, bewitching in your splendour !\n\nWith equal thunder in town and village,\nYou blazed over Ahrabal, and down\nVia Khanabal, showering the nectar of love.\n\nYour zigzag form, like wavy hair\nWith plaits twirled all over the golden curls,\nOr like wild flowers on sinuous stems !\n\nGoing to your husband's home in the evening\nWith bridal dress of sparkling starch,\nYou turned back soon to rush to your father's !\n\nWhen you peeped under the curtain, we got a glimpse;\nYou too saw the whole world at a glance,\nAnd soon wrapped yourself up again.\n\nWhich sage gave you the secret truth\nThat the world isn't good for spotless souls ?\nO yemberzal, does that make you keep away ?\n\nO gorgeous shape, if the world is evil,\nWhy do you often gaze at it ?\nWhat desire draws you, O masval ?\n\nWhat does it mean, you being attired\nIn red robes from top to toe ?\nDoes it signify innocent blood ?\n\nYour precious torch flames its light,\nNow and again, to show the path\nTo those who have lost their way.\n\nO blazing torch of the high skies !\nWhom does your light seek so late at night,\nOr you just love playing hide-and-seek ?\n\nFate has played foul with Mahjoor,\nGiving him as comrades total strangers,\nWho mistake his pearls as dust !"}
