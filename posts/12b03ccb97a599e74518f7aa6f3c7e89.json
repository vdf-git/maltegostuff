{"subject": "A Retrospect Of Humidity", "text": "All the air conditioners now slacken\ntheir hummed carrier wave. Once again\nwe've served our three months with remissions\nin the steam and dry iron of this seaboard.\nIn jellied glare, through the nettle-rash season\nwe've watched the sky's fermenting laundry\nportend downpours. Some came, and steamed away,\nand we were clutched back into the rancid\nsaline midnights of orifice weather,\nto damp grittiness and wiping off the air. \n\nMetaphors slump irritably together in\nthe muggy weeks. Shark and jellyfish shallows\nbecome suburbs where you breathe a fat towel;\nbabies burst like tomatoes with discomfort\nin the cotton-wrapped pointing street markets;\nthe Lycra-bulging surf drips from non-swimmers\nmiles from shore, and somehow includes soil.\nSkins, touching, soak each other. Skin touching\nany surface wets that and itself\nin a kind of mutual digestion.\nThrobbing heads grow lianas of nonsense. \n\nIt's our annual visit to the latitudes\nof rice, kerosene and resignation,\nan averted, temporary visit\nunrelated, for most, to the attitudes\nof festive northbound jets gaining height -\ncloser, for some few, to the memory\nof ulcers scraped with a tin spoon\nor sweated faces bowing before dry\nwhere the flesh is worn inside out,\nall the hunger-organs clutched in rank nylon,\nby those for whom exhaustion is spirit: \n\nan intrusive, heart-narrowing season\nat this far southern foot of the monsoon.\nAs the kleenex flower, the hibiscus\ndrops its browning wads, we forget\nannually, as one forgets a sickness.\nThe stifling days will never come again,\nnot now that we've seen the first sweater\ntugged down on the beauties of division\nand inside the rain's millions, a risen\nloaf of cat on a cool night verandah. \nAnonymous submission."}
