{"subject": "A Prayer For The Past: Now Far From My Old Northern Land,", "text": "Now far from my old northern land,\nI live where gentle winters pass;\nWhere green seas lave a wealthy strand,\nAnd unsown is the grass\n;\n\nWhere gorgeous sunsets claim the scope\nOf gazing heaven to spread their show,\nHang scarlet clouds in the topmost cope,\nWith fringes flaming low;\n\nWith one beside me in whose eyes\nOnce more old Nature finds a home;\nThere treasures up her changeful skies,\nHer phosphorescent foam.\n\nO'er a new joy this day we bend,\nSoft power from heaven our souls to lift;\nA wondering wonder thou dost lend\nWith loan outpassing gift-\n\nA little child. She sees the sun-\nOnce more incarnates thy old law:\nOne born of two, two born in one,\nShall into one three draw.\n\nBut is there no day creeping on\nWhich I should tremble to renew?\nI thank thee, Lord, for what is gone-\nThine is the future too!\nAnd are we not at home in Thee,\nAnd all this world a visioned show,\nThat, knowing what Abroad is, we\nWhat Home is too may know\n?"}
