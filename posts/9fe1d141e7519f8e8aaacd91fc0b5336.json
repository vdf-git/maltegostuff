Why be anxious?\nThe night of delusion is over; it's almost dawn.\nThe sun is rising, dispelling\nthick nets of darkness, and lotuses are blooming thanks to Siva\nat the top of your head.\nThe Vedas throw dust in your eyes; blind too\nthe six philosophies. If even the planets\ncan't fathom Her\nwho will break up these fun and games?\nThere are no lessons between teacher and student\nin a market of bliss.\nSince She owns the actors, the stage, and the play itself\nwho can grasp the truth of the drama?\n     A valiant devotee who knows the essence -- he\n     enters that city.\nRamprasad says, My delusion is broken;\nwho can bundle up fire?"}
