{"subject": "Mercy's Dream", "text": "1.\n\nI dream'd that o'er my soul there came,\nA grief that moved my stricken heart;\nAnd as I mourn'd, the sinful world\nDid taunt me with its wicked art;\nBut then methought as thus I sigh'd,\nAn Angel came - it seem'd from Heav'n\nWho clad me in a garb of gold,\nAnd whisper'd 'Peace' to the begiv'n.\n\n2.\n\nA crown of gold upon my brow\nWith gentle hand he kindly placed,\nAnd on my neck a glist'ning chain,\nThe dust of earth had ne'er defaced;\nWith silent step he led me forth\nUntil we reach'd a golden gate\nAnd passing onward to a throne\nHe bid me pause and there to wait.\n\n3.\n\nThe scene was bright - like twinkling stars,\nOr rather like the noonday sun,\nAnd then I smiled in that sweet dream,\nIt seems so bright to look upon;\nFor he who sat upon the throne\nHe'd meet me with a smile of cheer,\nAnd with a loving voice exclaim'd -\n'I welcome thee my daughter here.'"}
