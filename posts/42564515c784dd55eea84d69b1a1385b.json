{"subject": "A Day Of Dream", "text": "On that bold hill, against a broad blue stream,\nstood Arthur Phillip on a day of dream;\nwhat time the mists of morning westward rolled\nand heaven flowered on a bay of gold.\nHere, in the hour that shines and sounds afar,\nflamed first Old England's banner like a star;\nHere in a time august with prayer and praise,\nwas born the nation of these splendid days,\nand here, this land's majestic yesterday\nof immemorial silence died away"}
