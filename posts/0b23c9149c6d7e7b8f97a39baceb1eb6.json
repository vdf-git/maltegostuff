{"subject": "Written In Montaignes Essays. Given To The Duke Of Shrewsbury In France, After The Peace", "text": "Dictate, O mighty judge, what thou hast seen\nOf cities and of courts, of books and men,\nAnd deign to let thy servant hold the pen.\n\nThrough ages, thus, I may presume to live,\nAnd from the transcript of thy prose receive\nWhat my own short-lived verse can never give.\n\nThus shall fair Britain, with a gracious smile,\nAccept the work, and the instructed isle\nFor more than treaties made shall bless my toil.\n\nNor longer hence the Gallic style preferr'd,\nWisdom in English idiom shall be heard,\nWhile Talbot tells the world where Montaigne err'd."}
