{"subject": "The Merry Window", "text": "The alabaster legs of the lonely woman\nhang from the window like white ensigns\nout of the laughing window like false teeth\nsheets, flagstaffs, telescopes, rolls of music,\nor you would say beheaded necks of swans\nor the electric horns of factories\nwhere foreign dreams are nightly fabricated.\n\nYearning for her coal once heaved in the seam\nfor her the sewers shrieked their way through London\nand pigeons ate each other in the air.\n\nBut the deserted lady is frozen to the marrow\nher heart has floated into her left leg\nand her forked tongue asks in three languages\nfor a bassoon, a pyramid, and an egg.\n\nAll the white birds have flown out of her lips\nthe Polar Bear has eaten her left breast\nher eyes are covered with yellow webs of dust,\nin fact she is what a Saint would call abandoned\nsince even her own self has forgotten her."}
