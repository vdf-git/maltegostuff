{"subject": "To Angela", "text": "1\n\nA lonely destiny in abandoned rooms\n\nA soft insanity gropes on wallpapers.\n\nBeds of geraniums flow by windows,\n\nDaffodils also and more chaste in wasting away\n\nAs alabaster which gleams in the garden.\n\nIn blue veils India's mornings smile.\n\nTheir sweet incense scares away the stranger's worries,\n\nSleepless night by the pond because of Angela.\n\nHis pain rests hidden in an empty mask,\n\nThoughts which steal away blackly in the darkness.\n\nThe thrushes laugh all around from soft throats. \n2\n\nThe fruits which round red in branches,-\n\nAngela's lips which show her sweetness,\n\nLike nymphs who bend over springs\n\nIn restful viewing for long hours,\n\nThe green-gold, long hours of the afternoon.\n\nHowever, sometimes the spirit returns to fight and game.\n\nIn golden clouds a battle melee surges\n\nAnd a hyacinth-like thing floats from mazy cresses.\n\nA demon ponders thunderstorms in the sultriness,\n\nIn the grave's shadow of sad cypresses.\n\nThen the first lightning falls from black flues.\n3\n\nThe June willows' whisper in the evening;\n\nA rain resounds long in flute sounds.\n\nHow motionless the birds hang in the gray!\n\nAnd here Angela's rest in the dim branches;\n\nThe poet is this beauty's priest.\n\nHis mouth is flowed around by dark coolness.\n\nIn the valley fog softy rests poured out.\n\nBy the edge of the forest and gloom's shadow\n\nA golden thing floats flowing from his mouth\n\nBy the edge of the forest and gloom's shadow.\n\nNight embraces his drunken languishing."}
