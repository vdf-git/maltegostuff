{"subject": "The Vampire as Narcissist", "text": "Yes, the hair continues to grow after death\u2014\neven more so among the living dead.\nBefore a night out on the town,\nhe can't just go into a barber shop and say,\n'Shave and a haircut, two bits.'\n(Even though he is old enough to remember\nwhen those services only cost a quarter.)\nSo, at home, he passes on the electric razor\n(besides, the power to the mansion\nwas shut off, past due years before):\ninstead, opting for the good, old-fashioned straightedge.\nTrying to unearth his reflection in the mirror,\nhe draws blood\nalong with a full-throated scream.\nLicking the blade clean,\ndrawing fresh blood from the tongue,\nhe drinks even deeper of the elixir of death.\nNo reason to go out now.\nHe can just stay home\nand enjoy himself."}
