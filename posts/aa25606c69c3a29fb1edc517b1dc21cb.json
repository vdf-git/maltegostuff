{"subject": "Epitaph For A Roman Catholic Churchyard", "text": "Weary centinel of earth,\nGrief's companion from my birth,\nDoomed no more to watch and weep,\nNow I sleep the dreamless sleep\nIn this calmly shrouding cell;\nBut what the waking\u2014who may tell!\nIn that fated hour of fear,\nMary! Mother! be thou here.\nFear to sooth and hope to shed,\nBend thee o'er this earthy bed;\nAnd let my waking view thee mild\nAs mother o'er her wakening child."}
