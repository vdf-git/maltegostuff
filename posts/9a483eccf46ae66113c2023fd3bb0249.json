{"subject": "Day And Night", "text": "Day goeth bold in cloth of gold,\nA royal bridegroom he;\nBut Night in jewelled purple walks,\nA Queen of Mystery.\n\nDay filleth up his loving-cup\nWith vintage golden-clear;\nBut Night her ebon chalice crowns\nWith wine as pale as Fear.\n\nDay drinks to Life, to ruddy Life,\nAnd holds a kingly feast.\nNight drinks to Death; and while she drinks,\nDay rises in the East!\n\nThey may not meet; they may not greet;\nEach keeps a separate way:\nDay knoweth not the stars of Night,\nNor Night the Star of Day.\n\nSo runs the reign of Other Twain.\nBehold! the Preacher saith\nDeath knoweth not the Light of Life,\nNor Life the Light of Death!"}
