{"subject": "Astr\u00e6a At The Capitol", "text": "WHEN first I saw our banner wave\nAbove the nation's council-hall,\nI heard beneath its marble wall\nThe clanking fetters of the slave!\n\nIn the foul market-place I stood,\nAnd saw the Christian mother sold,\nAnd childhood with its locks of gold,\nBlue-eyed and fair with Saxon blood.\n\nI shut my eyes, I held my breath,\nAnd, smothering down the wrath and shame\nThat set my Northern blood aflame,\nStood silent,--where to speak was death.\n\nBeside me gloomed the prison-cell\nWhere wasted one in slow decline\nFor uttering simple words of mine,\nAnd loving freedom all too well.\n\nThe flag that floated from the dome\nFlapped menace in the morning air;\nI stood a perilled stranger where\nThe human broker made his home.\n\nFor crime was virtue: Gown and Sword\nAnd Law their threefold sanction gave,\nAnd to the quarry of the slave\nWent hawking with our symbol-bird.\n\nOn the oppressor's side was power;\nAnd yet I knew that every wrong,\nHowever old, however strong,\nBut waited God's avenging hour.\n\nI knew that truth would crush the lie,\nSomehow, some time, the end would be;\nYet scarcely dared I hope to see\nThe triumph with my mortal eye.\n\nBut now I see it! In the sun\nA free flag floats from yonder dome,\nAnd at the nation's hearth and home\nThe justice long delayed is done.\n\nNot as we hoped, in calm of prayer,\nThe message of deliverance comes,\nBut heralded by roll of drums\nOn waves of battle-troubled air!\n\nMidst sounds that madden and appall,\nThe song that Bethlehem's shepherds knew!\nThe harp of David melting through\nThe demon-agonies of Saul!\n\nNot as we hoped; but what are we?\nAbove our broken dreams and plans\nGod lays, with wiser hand than man's,\nThe corner-stones of liberty.\n\nI cavil not with Him: the voice\nThat freedom's blessed gospel tells\nIs sweet to me as silver bells,\nRejoicing! yea, I will rejoice!\n\nDear friends still toiling in the sun;\nYe dearer ones who, gone before,\nAre watching from the eternal shore\nThe slow work by your hands begun,\n\nRejoice with me! The chastening rod\nBlossoms with love; the furnace heat\nGrows cool beneath His blessed feet\nWhose form is as the Son of God!\n\nRejoice! Our Marah's bitter springs\nAre sweetened; on our ground of grief\nRise day by day in strong relief\nThe prophecies of better things.\n\nRejoice in hope! The day and night\nAre one with God, and one with them\nWho see by faith the cloudy hem\nOf Judgement fringed with Mercy's light"}
