{"subject": "Written In 1834", "text": "Well, when her day is over, be it said\nThat, though a speck on the terrestrial globe,\nFound with long search and in a moment lost,\nShe made herself a name--a name to live\nWhile science, eloquence, and song divine,\nAnd wisdom, in self-government displayed,\nAnd valour, such as only in the Free,\nShall among men be honoured.\nEvery sea\nWas covered with her sails, in every port\nHer language spoken; and, where'er you went,\nExploring, to the east, or to the west,\nEven to the rising or the setting day,\nHer arts and laws and institutes were there,\nMoving with silent and majestic march,\nOnward and onward, where no pathway was;\nThere her adventurous sons, like those of old,\nFounding vast empires - empires in their turn\nDestined to shine thro' many a distant age\nWith sun-like splendour.\nWondrous was her wealth,\nThe world itself her willing tributary;\nyet, to accomplish what her soul desired,\nAll was as nothing; and the mightiest kings, \nEach in his hour of strife exhausted, fallen,\nDrew strength from Her, their coffers from her own\nFilled to o'erflowing. When her fleets of war\nHad swept the main; when not an adverse prow,\nFrom pole to pole, far as the sea-bird flies,\nRuffled the tide; and they themselves were gone,\nGone from the eyes and from the minds of men,\nTheir dreadful errands so entirely done -\nUp rose her armies; on the land they stood,\nFearless, erect; and in an instant smote\nHim with his legions.\nYet ere long 'twas here,\nGreat as her triumphs, to eclipse them all,\nTo do what none had done, none had conceived,\nAn act how glorious, making joy in heaven!\nWhen, such her prodigality, condemned\nTo toil and toil, alas, how hopelessly,\nHerself in bonds, for ages unredeemed -\nAs with a god-like energy she sprung,\nAll else forgot, and, burdened as she was,\nRansomed the African."}
