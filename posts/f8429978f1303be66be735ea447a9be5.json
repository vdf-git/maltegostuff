{"subject": "Characters", "text": "OH! born to sooth distress, and lighten care;\nLively as soft, and innocent as fair;\nBlest with that sweet simplicity of thought\nSo rarely found, and never to be taught;\nOf winning speech, endearing, artless, kind,\nThe loveliest pattern of a female mind;\nLike some fair spirit from the realms of rest\nWith all her native heaven within her breast;\nSo pure, so good, she scarce can guess at sin,\n\nBut thinks the world without like that within;\nSuch melting tenderness, so fond to bless,\nHer charity almost becomes excess.\nWealth may be courted, wisdom be rever'd,\nAnd beauty prais'd, and brutal strength be fear'd;\nBut goodness only can affection move;\nAnd love must owe its origin to love.\n\n\nOF gentle manners, and of taste refin'd,\nWith all the graces of a polish'd mind;\nClear sense and truth still shone in all she spoke,\n\nAnd from her lips no idle sentence broke.\nEach nicer elegance of art she knew;\nCorrectly fair, and regularly true :\nHer ready fingers plied with equal skill\nThe pencil's task, the needle, or the quill.\nSo pois'd her feelings, so compos'd her soul,\nSo subject all to reason's calm controul,\nOne only passion, strong, and unconfin'd,\nDisturb'd the balance of her even mind:\nOne passion rul'd despotic in her breast,\nIn every word, and look, and thought confest;\nBut that was love, and love delights to bless\nThe generous transports of a fond excess."}
