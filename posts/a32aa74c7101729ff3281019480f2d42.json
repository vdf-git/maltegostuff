{"subject": "Magnets", "text": "A far look in absorbed eyes, unaware \nOf what some gazer thrills to gather there; \nA happy voice, singing to itself apart, \nThat pulses new blood through a listener's heart; \nOld fortitude; and, 'mid an hour of dread, \nThe scorn of all odds in a proud young head;- \nThese are themselves, and being but what they are, \nOf others' praise or pity have no care, \nYet still are magnets to another's need. \nInvisibly as wind, blowing stray seed, \nLife breathes on life, though ignorant what it brings, \nAnd spirit touches spirit on the strings \nWhere music is: courage from courage glows \nIn secret; shy powers to themselves unclose; \nAnd the most solitary hope, that gray \nPatience has sister'd, ripens far away \nIn young bosoms. Oh, we have failed and failed, \nAnd never knew if we or the world ailed, \nClouded and thwarted; yet perhaps the best \nOf all we do and dream of lives unguessed."}
