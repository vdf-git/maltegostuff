{"subject": "The Temptation Of St. Anthony", "text": "-After a design by F\u00e9licien Rops-\n\nThe Cross, the Cross is tainted! O most Just,\nBe merciful, and save me from this snare.\nThe Tempter lures me as I bend in prayer\nBefore the sacred symbol of our trust.\nYea, that most Holy of Holies feeds my lust,\nThe body of thy Christ; for, unaware,\nEven as I kneel and pray, lo, She is there,\nThe temptress, she the wanton; and she hath thrust\nThe bruis\u00e8d body off, and all her own,\nShameless, she stretches on the cross, arms wide,\nLimbs pendent, in libidinous mockery.\nShe draws mine eyes to her--Ah, sin unknown!\nShe smiles, she triumphs; but the Crucified\nFalls off into the darkness with a cry."}
