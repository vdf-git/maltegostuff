{"subject": "In Green Old Gardens", "text": "In green old gardens, hidden away\nFrom sight of revel and sound of strife,\nWhere the bird may sing out his soul ere he die,\nNor fears for the night, so he lives his day;\nWhere the high red walls, which are growing gray\nWith their lichen and moss embroideries,\nSeem sadly and sternly to shut out life,\nBecause it is often as red as they;\n\nWhere even the bee has time to glide\n(Gathering gayly his honey's store)\nRight to the heart of the old-world flowers -\nChina-asters and purple stocks,\nDahlias and tall red hollyhocks,\nLaburnums raining their golden showers,\nColumbines prim of the folded core,\nAnd lupins, and larkspurs, and 'London pride';\n\nWhere the heron is waiting amongst the reeds,\nGrown tame in the silence that reigns around,\nBroken only, now and then,\nBy shy woodpecker or noisy jay,\nBy the far-off watch-dog's muffled bay;\nBut where never the purposeless laughter of men,\nOr the seething city's murmurous sound\nWill float up over the river-weeds.\n\nHere may I live what life I please,\nMarried and buried out of sight, -\nMarried to pleasure, and buried to pain, -\nHidden away amongst scenes like these,\nUnder the fans of the chestnut trees;\nLiving my child-life over again,\nWith the further hope of a fallen delight,\nBlithe as the birds and wise as the bees.\n\nIn green old gardens, hidden away\nFrom sight of revel and sound of strife, -\nHere have I leisure to breathe and move,\nAnd to do my work in a nobler way;\nTo sing my songs, and to say my say;\nTo dream my dreams, and to love my love;\nTo hold my faith, and to live my life,\nMaking the most of its shadowy day."}
