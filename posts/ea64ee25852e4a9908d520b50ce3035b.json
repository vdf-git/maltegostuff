{"subject": "Unaware", "text": "Obviously, I'm not like\nAny of those weavers of words\nWho knit their suits and their careers\nTheir glory and their pride,\nAlthough I mix with them\nAnd they look at my words as if they were \nsweaters:\n\"How well-dressed you are!\" they say;\n\"That poem looks so good on you!\"\nAlways unaware\nThat poems aren't my clothes,\nBut my bones -\nPainfully extracted\nAnd placed around my flesh like a shell,\nFollowing the example of tortoises\nThat manage to survive that way\nFor long and unhappy\nCenturies."}
