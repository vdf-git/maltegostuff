{"subject": "Indra", "text": "DOWN to the sand-covered earth. \nStraw from the harvested fields soiled our feet; \nDust from the high-roads, \nSmoke from the cities, \nFoul-smelling breaths, \nFumes from cellars and kitchens, \nAll we endured. \nThen to the open sea we fled, \nFilling our lungs with air, \nShaking our wings, \nAnd laving our feet. \n\nIndra, Lord of the Heavens, \nHear us! \nHear our sighing! \nUnclean is the earth; \nEvil is life; \nNeither good nor bad \nCan men be deemed. \nAs they can, they live, \nOne day at a time. \nSons of dust, through dust they journey; \nBorn out of dust, to dust they return. \nGiven they were, for trudging, \nFeet, not wings for flying. \nDusty they grow-- \nLies the fault then with them, \nOr with Thee?"}
