{"subject": "The Lonely Eagle Soars", "text": "Like the lonely eagle\nWho glides on winds of time, \nI too shall fly alone\nFor you're no longer mine.\n\nLife came along and took you\nAnd left me alone to fly, \nNow I soar above the clouds\nAlone again I cry.\n\nOnce upon the eagles wings\nWe soared above it all, \nWe lofted high on pillowed clouds\nUntil death heard your call.\n\nYour eagles wings have lifted\nAnd changed with the shifting breeze, \nThey now belong to an angel\nWho soars high above the trees.\n\nIf anything should happen now\nI know not what  I'd do, \nFor even though you're not here\nI still belong to you.\n\nIf I must learn to fly alone\nI will do so for all my life, \nFor no one else flies with me\nSince I became your wife.\n\nMy Eagles heart knows you\nAs my lifelong mate\nNow I'll forever fly alone\nSince death sealed your fate.\n\nNo one else will ever loft\nHigh above with me, \nFor my pain inside is heavy\nAnd has forever grounded me."}
