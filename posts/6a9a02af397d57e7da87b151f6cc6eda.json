{"subject": "The Evil Seekers", "text": "We are born with luck\nwhich is to say with gold in our mouth.\nAs new and smooth as a grape,\nas pure as a pond in Alaska,\nas good as the stem of a green bean-\nwe are born and that ought to be enough,\nwe ought to be able to carry on from that\nbut one must learn about evil,\nlearn what is subhuman,\nlearn how the blood pops out like a scream,\none must see the night\nbefore one can realize the day,\none must listen hard to the animal within,\none must walk like a sleepwalker\non the edge of a roof,\none must throw some part of her body\ninto the devil's mouth.\nOdd stuff, you'd say.\nBut I'd say\nyou must die a little,\nhave a book of matches go off in your hand,\nsee your best friend copying your exam,\nvisit an Indian reservation and see\ntheir plastic feathers,\nthe dead dream.\nOne must be a prisoner just once to hear\nthe lock twist into his gut.\nAfter all that\none is free to grasp at the trees, the stones,\nthe sky, the birds that make sense out of air.\nBut even in a telephone booth\nevil can seep out of the receiver\nand we must cover it with a mattress,\nand then tear it from its roots\nand bury it,\nbury it."}
