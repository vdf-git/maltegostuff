{"subject": "As We Are So Wonderfully Done With Each Other", "text": "As we are so wonderfully done with each other   \nWe can walk into our separate sleep\nOn floors of music where the milkwhite cloak of childhood lies\n\nO my lady, my fairest dear, my sweetest, loveliest one\nYour lips have splashed my dull house with the speech of flowers   \nMy hands are hallowed where they touched over your\n       soft curving.\n\nIt is good to be weary from that brilliant work   \nIt is being God to feel your breathing under me\n\nA waterglass on the bureau fills with morning . . .   \nDon\u2019t let anyone in to wake us."}
