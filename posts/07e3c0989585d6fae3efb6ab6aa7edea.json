{"subject": "Beforehand", "text": "On the blue veins \ngoing to waking sleep.\nIt has its own city.\n\nLike big cherry picks, \nwhen your presence purred in my chest.\n\nThe bare fangs, \napproach slowly.\n\nIt crumples your hormones \nthat was not a small dying.\n\nThe pulse runs fast, \neven faster than light. Still \nyou wait in penumbra.\n\nAll that you did was \nraising the eyebrows, to \nask, who were you.\n\nNo introspection was needed \nto clean the color of smiles."}
