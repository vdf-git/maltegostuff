{"subject": "The Big Heart", "text": "'Too many things are occurring for even a big heart to hold.' - From an essay by W. B. Yeats \n\nBig heart, \nwide as a watermelon, \nbut wise as birth, \nthere is so much abundance \nin the people I have: \nMax, Lois, Joe, Louise, \nJoan, Marie, Dawn, \nArlene, Father Dunne, \nand all in their short lives \ngive to me repeatedly, \nin the way the sea \nplaces its many fingers on the shore, \nagain and again \nand they know me, \nthey help me unravel, \nthey listen with ears made of conch shells, \nthey speak back with the wine of the best region. \nThey are my staff. \nThey comfort me. \n\nThey hear how \nthe artery of my soul has been severed \nand soul is spurting out upon them, \nbleeding on them, \nmessing up their clothes, \ndirtying their shoes. \nAnd God is filling me, \nthough there are times of doubt \nas hollow as the Grand Canyon, \nstill God is filling me. \nHe is giving me the thoughts of dogs, \nthe spider in its intricate web, \nthe sun \nin all its amazement, \nand a slain ram \nthat is the glory, \nthe mystery of great cost, \nand my heart, \nwhich is very big, \nI promise it is very large, \na monster of sorts, \ntakes it all in\u2014 \nall in comes the fury of love."}
