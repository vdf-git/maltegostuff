{"subject": "Sonnet Xxxi", "text": "Thou comest ! all is said without a word.\nI sit beneath thy looks, as children do\nIn the noon-sun, with souls that tremble through\nTheir happy eyelids from an unaverred\nYet prodigal inward joy. Behold, I erred\nIn that last doubt ! and yet I cannot rue\nThe sin most, but the occasion--that we two\nShould for a moment stand unministered\nBy a mutual presence. Ah, keep near and close,\nThou dovelike help ! and, when my fears would rise,\nWith thy broad heart serenely interpose:\nBrood down with thy divine sufficiencies\nThese thoughts which tremble when bereft of those,\nLike callow birds left desert to the skies."}
