{"subject": "Take Back The Virgin Page", "text": "Written on Returning a Blank Book\nTake back the virgin page, \nWhite and unwritten still; \nSome hand, more calm and sage, \nThe leaf must fill. \nThoughts come, as pure as light \nPure as even you require; \nBut, oh! each word I write \nLove turns to fire. \n\nYet let me keep the book: \nOft shall my heart renew, \nWhen on its leaves I look, \nDear thoughts of you. \nLike you, 'tis fair and bright; \nLike you, too bright and fair \nTo let wild passion write \nOne wrong wish there. \n\nHaply, when from those eyes \nFar, far away I roam, \nShould calmer thoughts arise \nTowards you and home; \nFancy may trace some line, \nWorthy those eyes to meet, \nThoughts that not burn, but shine, \nPure, calm, and sweet. \n\nAnd as, o'er ocean far, \nSeamen their records keep, \nLed by some hidden star \nThrough the cold deep; \nSo may the words I write \nTell through what storms I stray -- \nYou still the unseen light, \nGuiding my way."}
