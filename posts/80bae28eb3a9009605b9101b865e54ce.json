{"subject": "Improvisations: Light And Snow: 10", "text": "It is night time, and cold, and snow is falling,\nAnd no wind grieves the walls.\nIn the small world of light around the arc-lamp\nA swarm of snowflakes falls and falls.\nThe street grows silent. The last stranger passes.\nThe sound of his feet, in the snow, is indistinct.\nWhat forgotten sadness is it, on a night like this,\nTakes possession of my heart?\nWhy do I think of a camellia tree in a southern garden,\nWith pink blossoms among dark leaves,\nStanding, surprised, in the snow?\nWhy do I think of spring?\nThe snowflakes, helplessly veering,,\nFall silently past my window;\nThey come from darkness and enter darkness.\nWhat is it in my heart is surprised and bewildered\nLike that camellia tree,\nBeautiful still in its glittering anguish?\nAnd spring so far away!"}
