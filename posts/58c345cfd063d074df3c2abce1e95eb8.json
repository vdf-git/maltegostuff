{"subject": "Sonnet V. True Rectitude", "text": "What constitutes the true nobility?\nNot wealth, nor name, nor outward pomp, nor power;\nFools have them all; and vicious men may be\nThe idols and the pageants of an hour.\nBut 'tis to have a good and honest heart,\nAbove all meanness and above all crime,\nAnd act the right and honorable part\nIn every circumstance of place and time.\nHe, who is thus, from God his patent takes,\nHis Maker formed him the true nobleman;\nWhate'er is low and vicious he forsakes,\nAnd acts on rectitude's unchanging plan.\nThings change around him; changes touch not him;\nThe star, that guides his path, fails not, nor waxes dim."}
