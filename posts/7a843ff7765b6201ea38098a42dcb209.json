{"subject": "Out In The Cold", "text": "Out in the cold mid the dreary night,\nUnder the eaves of homes so bright:\nSnowflakes falling o'er mother's grave\nWill no one rescue, no one save?\n\nA child left out in the dark and cold,\nA lamb not sheltered in any fold,\nHearing the wolves of hunger bark,\nOut in the cold! and out in the dark\n\nMissing to-night the charming bliss,\nThat lies in the mother's good-night kiss;\nAnd hearing no loving father's prayer,\nFor blessings his children all may share.\n\nCreeping away to some wretched den,\nTo sleep mid the curses of drunken men\nAnd women, not as God has made,\nWrecked and ruined, wronged and betrayed.\n\nChurch of the Lord reach out thy arm,\nAnd shield the hapless one from harm;\nWhere the waves of sin are dashing wild\nRescue and save the drifting child.\n\nWash from her life guilt's turbid foam,\nIn the fair haven of a home;\nTenderly lead the motherless girl\nUp to the gates of purest pearl.\n\nThe wandering feet which else had strayed,\nFrom thorny paths may yet be stayed;\nAnd a crimson track through the cold dark night\nMay exchange to a line of loving light."}
