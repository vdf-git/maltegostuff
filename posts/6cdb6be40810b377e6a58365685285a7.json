{"subject": "Anticipation.", "text": "In the bright summer weather\nWe twain will go together,\nBy the river's silver swathes,\nWhere the melilotus bathes\nIts blooms gold--bright;\nAnd along the distant stream\nBroods the white silent steam,\nThickening onward like a dream\nIn the first sleep of night.\n\nIn the warm summer weather\nWe twain will go together,\nOn the west side of the hill,\nWhile the leaves are keeping still,\nAs the sun goes down;\nAnd the long straight streams\nOf the mellow setting beams\nLight up with rosy gleams\nMountain, moor, and town.\n\nIn the calm summer weather\nWe twain will go together,\nWhen the western planet's light\nIs full, and warm, and bright,\nAbove the western flood;\nOnly the impatient rill\nTo itself is talking still,\nBy the hedge--row down the hill,\nOn the border of the wood."}
