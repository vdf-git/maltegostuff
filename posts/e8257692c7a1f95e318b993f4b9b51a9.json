{"subject": "Canadians", "text": "My father said: here they lie,\nthe Canadians. I saw them standing\nby the canal, in their grey clothing.\nEndless rows, fit for the slaughter.\n\nShoulder to shoulder, they stood:\nthe slightest wind and off they'd go.\n\nIn peace. Canadians on both\nsides. Here for too long\nto go back. Too deep\nin the ground to march away.\n\nTranslation: Willem Groenewegen, 2010."}
