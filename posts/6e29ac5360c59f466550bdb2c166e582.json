{"subject": "Dreams", "text": "If life is but a dream,\n Where from doth it spring?\n Aren't dreams ethereal/\n Are they real?\n A dream as such\n is nothing much,\n but a relate\n of daily events,\n if good to explore, if bad to ignore.\n Life is more than ad ream,\n it's a journey\n form the day\n we're born till the day we die.\n To live to dream is not like\n to dream to live,\n There's the rub,\n DREAMS MAKE OR BREAK US!"}
