{"subject": "WORDS DON'T DIE OF COLD", "text": "Words don't die of cold\nthey die from a lack of courage\nWords often perish\nbecause of humid weather\n\nI once met\na word\nthat was like a bright red bird\nin the swamp along the riverbank in my village\nI brought it home\nbut as soon as we reached the wooden door-frame\nit gave me\na strangely terrified look\nand breathed its last\n\nAfter that I started fearing words\nIf I ran into them I beat a hasty retreat\nif I saw a hairy word dressed in brilliant colours\nadvancing towards me\nI often simply shut my eyes\n\nSlowly after a while\nI started to enjoy this game\nOne day for no reason at all\nI hit a beautiful word with a stone\nwhile it hid\nlike a snake in a pile of chaff\n\nI remember its lovely glittering eyes\ndown to this day\n\nWith the passage of time\nmy fear has decreased\nWhen I encounter words today\nwe always end up asking after each other\n\nNow I've come to know\nmany of their hiding-places\nI've become familiar with\nmany of their varied colours\nNow I know for instance\nthat the simplest words\nare brown and beige\nand the most destructive\nare pale yellow and pink\n\nMost often the words we save\nfor our saddest and heaviest moments\nare the ones\nthat on the occasions meant for them\nseem merely obscene\n\nAnd what shall I do now\nwith the fact that I've found\nperfectly useless words\nthat wear ugly colours\nand lie discarded in the garbage\nto be the most trustworthy\nin my moments of danger\n\nIt happened just yesterday -\nhalf a dozen healthy and attractive words\nsuddenly surrounded me\nin a dark street\nI lost my nerve -\n\nFor a while I stood before them\nspeechless\nand drenched in sweat\nThen I ran\nI'd just lifted my foot in the air\nwhen a tiny little word\nbathed in blood\nran up to me out of nowhere panting\nand said -\n\u2018Come, I'll take you home'"}
