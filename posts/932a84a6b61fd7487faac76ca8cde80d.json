{"subject": "Latter-Day Warnings", "text": "WHEN legislators keep the law,\nWhen banks dispense with bolts and looks,\nWhen berries--whortle, rasp, and straw--\nGrow bigger downwards through the box,--\n\nWhen he that selleth house or land\nShows leak in roof or flaw in right,--\nWhen haberdashers choose the stand\nWhose window hath the broadest light,--\n\nWhen preachers tell us all they think,\nAnd party leaders all they mean,--\nWhen what we pay for, that we drink,\nFrom real grape and coffee-bean,--\n\nWhen lawyers take what they would give,\nAnd doctors give what they would take,--\nWhen city fathers eat to live,\nSave when they fast for conscience' sake,--\n\nWhen one that hath a horse on sale\nShall bring his merit to the proof,\nWithout a lie for every nail\nThat holds the iron on the hoof,--\n\nWhen in the usual place for rips\nOur gloves are stitched with special care,\nAnd guarded well the whalebone tips\nWhere first umbrellas need repair,--\n\nWhen Cuba's weeds have quite forgot\nThe power of suction to resist,\nAnd claret-bottles harbor not\nSuch dimples as would hold your fist,--\n\nWhen publishers no longer steal,\nAnd pay for what they stole before,--\nWhen the first locomotive's wheel\nRolls through the Hoosac Tunnel's bore;--\n\nTill then let Cumming blaze away,\nAnd Miller's saints blow up the globe;\nBut when you see that blessed day,\nThen order your ascension robe."}
