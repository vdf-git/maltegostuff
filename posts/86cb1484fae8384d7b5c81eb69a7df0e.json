{"subject": "Curse One: The Wraith", "text": "You are a small shape of death crouched among leaves.\nThe twist of your red mouth is the torque of poison.\nTangle of leaves, spill of leaves, slow rot of leaves. . .\nMisery, ruin, iniquity. You are the scuffling thing in dry grass.\nRodent, snail, the curly-legged spider, centipede, rat snake.\nI see you by the back-hooded barbecue in November, brooding\nlike the smoke of burned meat. The fire in the coals gone out, \nthe sun hung low and weak in smoldering sky, cold\nbreath of winter. You are all smoke breath, grief, and conniving.\nYou are the alien thing invading my garden, a haunt, a plague, \nlurking beyond light and warmth, there in the shadows wearing\ndeath inside out, a curse on the sky. You are a spot, a flaw, a\nblotch and a stain on the world you corrupt and I hate\nyou and fear you and look for you everywhere with dread."}
