{"subject": "The Cure", "text": "When you can't get her out of your head, young man,\nAnd you hate what you have to do; \nAnd you shirk every task that you find you can, \nAnd the others you hurry through. \nWhen all you can see is the time to quit, \n(I know how each symptom goes), \nThere's only one way to get over it,\nThe next time you see her\u2014propose.\n\nWhen you think when you're called to the telephone\nThat hers is the voice you'll hear, \nAnd because it isn't, you sigh and groan;\nWhen you find that your brain's not clear \nAnd you can't add figures or write a bit\nWhen the columns are all awhirl, \nThere's only one way to get over it,\nAnd that is to marry the girl."}
