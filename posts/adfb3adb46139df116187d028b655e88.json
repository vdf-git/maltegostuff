{"subject": "The Bell(E) Of Baltimore", "text": "A million feet above the ground\n(For so it seemed in winding round),\nA million, and two more,\nThe latter stiff and sore,\nWhile perspiration formed a part\nOf every reeking pore,\nI viewed the city like a chart\nSpread out upon the floor.\n\nAnd said: 'Great guide Jehoiakin,\nTo me is meagre pleasure in\nThe height of spires and domes,\nOf walls like ancient Rome's;\nNor care I for the marts of trade,\nOr shelves of musty tomes,\nNor yet for yonder colonnade\nBefore your palace homes;\n\n'But curiosity is keen\nTo know the city's reigning queen,\nWho suiteth well the score\nOf suitors at her door;\nOh, which of your divinities\nIs she whom all adore?\nEmbodiment of truth, _who is_\nThe belle of Baltimore?'\n\nVeracity's revolving eyes\nLooked up as if to read the skies:\n'Why, Lor'-a-miss, see dar--\nDe bell is in de air!\nLan' sakes! of all de missteries\nYo' nebber learn before!\nWhy, don' yo' know 'Big Sam'? _He_ is\nDe bell of Baltimore!'"}
