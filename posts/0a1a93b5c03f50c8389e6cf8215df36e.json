{"subject": "Dirge For Brief Love", "text": "We have killed our little Love\nThat was but three days old;\nHe lies between us now like a small bird silenced,\nPitiful, still, and cold. \nIn honour's name we slew him,\nWho had no place on earth,\nWho out of jesting words and sunlit flowers\nSprang suddenly to birth. \nAbsolv\u00e8d now we stand;\nVirtue is satisfied:\nBut who shall quit us of this darker sinning,\nThis base infanticide? \nHere lies lost loveliness,\nTreasure we dared not keep.\nLet us, who gave him life, let us, who slew him,\nBury him deep, deep. \nYet stay-O, touch him not!\nWatch by his side awhile,\nLest he, not dead, but in a deep trance lying,\nShould wake again, and smile."}
