{"subject": "Fragment 2", "text": "WHERE yonder mossy ruins lie,\nAnd desolation strikes the eye,\nA noble mansion, high and fair,\nOnce rear'd its turrets in the air.\nThere infant warriors drew their breath,\nAnd learn'd to scorn the fear of death.\nIn halls where martial trophies hung,\nThey listen'd while the minstrels sung,\nOf pain and glory, toil and care,\nAnd all the horrid charms of war:\nThere caught the fond desire of fame,\nAnd punted for a hero's name.\nAlas! too oft in youthful bloom,\nRenown has crown'd the early tomb,\n\nHas pierc'd the widow's bosom deep,\nAnd taught the mother's eyes to weep.\nShe, on whose tale the stripling hung,\nWhile pride and sorrow rul'd her tongue.\nHis father's gallant acts to tell,\nHow bold he fought, how bravely fell.\nMethinks e'en now I hear her speak,\nI see the tear upon her cheek;\nThe musing boy's abstracted brow,\nAnd the high-arching eye below.\nThe stifled sigh and anxious heave,\nThe kindling heart which dares not grieve;\nThe finely-elevated head,\nThe hand upon the bosom spread,\nProclaim him wrought by potent charms,\nAnd speak his very soul in arms.\nIncautious zeal! what hast thou done?\nThe tale has robb'd thee of thy son.\nAnd while thy pious tears deplore,\nThe loss of him who lives no more,\nAmbition wakes her restless fire,\nThe boy will emulate his sire,"}
