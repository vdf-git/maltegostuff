{"subject": "The Loehrs And The Hammonds", "text": "'Hey, Bud! O Bud!' rang out a gleeful call,--\n'_The Loehrs is come to your house!_' And a small\nBut very much elated little chap,\nIn snowy linen-suit and tasseled cap,\nLeaped from the back-fence just across the street\nFrom Bixlers', and came galloping to meet\nHis equally delighted little pair\nOf playmates, hurrying out to join him there--\n'_The Loehrs is come!--The Loehrs is come!_' his glee\nAugmented to a pitch of ecstasy\nCommunicated wildly, till the cry\n'_The Loehrs is come!_' in chorus quavered high\nAnd thrilling as some paean of challenge or\nSoul-stirring chant of armied conqueror.\nAnd who this _avant courier_ of 'the Loehrs'?--\nThis happiest of all boys out-o'-doors--\nWho but Will Pierson, with his heart's excess\nOf summer-warmth and light and breeziness!\n'From our front winder I 'uz first to see\n'Em all a-drivin' into town!' bragged he--\n'An' seen 'em turnin' up the alley where\n_Your_ folks lives at. An' John an' Jake wuz there\nBoth in the wagon;--yes, an' Willy, too;\nAn' Mary--Yes, an' Edith--with bran-new\nAn' purtiest-trimmed hats 'at ever wuz!--\nAn' Susan, an' Janey.--An' the _Hammonds-uz_\nIn their fine buggy 'at they're ridin' roun'\nSo much, all over an' aroun' the town\nAn' _ever_'wheres,--them _city_-people who's\nA-visutin' at Loehrs-uz!'\n\nGlorious news!--\nEven more glorious when verified\nIn the boys' welcoming eyes of love and pride,\nAs one by one they greeted their old friends\nAnd neighbors.--Nor until their earth-life ends\nWill that bright memory become less bright\nOr dimmed indeed.\n\n... Again, at candle-light,\nThe faces all are gathered. And how glad\nThe Mother's features, knowing that she had\nHer dear, sweet Mary Loehr back again.--\nShe always was so proud of her; and then\nThe dear girl, in return, was happy, too,\nAnd with a heart as loving, kind and true\nAs that maturer one which seemed to blend\nAs one the love of mother and of friend.\nFrom time to time, as hand-in-hand they sat,\nThe fair girl whispered something low, whereat\nA tender, wistful look would gather in\nThe mother-eyes; and then there would begin\nA sudden cheerier talk, directed to\nThe stranger guests--the man and woman who,\nIt was explained, were coming now to make\nTheir temporary home in town for sake\nOf the wife's somewhat failing health. Yes, they\nWere city-people, seeking rest this way,\nThe man said, answering a query made\nBy some well meaning neighbor--with a shade\nOf apprehension in the answer.... No,--\nThey had no _children_. As he answered so,\nThe man's arm went about his wife, and she\nLeant toward him, with her eyes lit prayerfully:\nThen she arose--he following--and bent\nAbove the little sleeping innocent\nWithin the cradle at the mother's side--\nHe patting her, all silent, as she cried.--\nThough, haply, in the silence that ensued,\nHis musings made melodious interlude.\n\nIn the warm, health-giving weather\nMy poor pale wife and I\nDrive up and down the little town\nAnd the pleasant roads thereby:\nOut in the wholesome country\nWe wind, from the main highway,\nIn through the wood's green solitudes--\nFair as the Lord's own Day.\n\nWe have lived so long together.\nAnd joyed and mourned as one,\nThat each with each, with a look for speech,\nOr a touch, may talk as none\nBut Love's elect may comprehend--\nWhy, the touch of her hand on mine\nSpeaks volume-wise, and the smile of her eyes,\nTo me, is a song divine.\n\nThere are many places that lure us:--\n'The Old Wood Bridge' just west\nOf town we know--and the creek below,\nAnd the banks the boys love best:\nAnd 'Beech Grove,' too, on the hill-top;\nAnd 'The Haunted House' beyond,\nWith its roof half off, and its old pump-trough\nAdrift in the roadside pond.\n\nWe find our way to 'The Marshes'--\nAt least where they used to be;\nAnd 'The Old Camp Grounds'; and 'The Indian Mounds,'\nAnd the trunk of 'The Council Tree:'\nWe have crunched and splashed through 'Flint-bed Ford';\nAnd at 'Old Big Bee-gum Spring'\nWe have stayed the cup, half lifted up.\nHearing the redbird sing.\n\nAnd then, there is 'Wesley Chapel,'\nWith its little graveyard, lone\nAt the crossroads there, though the sun sets fair\nOn wild-rose, mound and stone ...\nA wee bed under the willows--\nMy wife's hand on my own--\nAnd our horse stops, too ... And we hear the coo\nOf a dove in undertone.\n\nThe dusk, the dew, and the silence.\n'Old Charley' turns his head\nHomeward then by the pike again,\nThough never a word is said--\nOne more stop, and a lingering one--\nAfter the fields and farms,--\nAt the old Toll Gate, with the woman await\nWith a little girl in her arms.\nThe silence sank--Floretty came to call\nThe children in the kitchen, where they all\nWent helter-skeltering with shout and din\nEnough to drown most sanguine silence in,--\nFor well indeed they knew that summons meant\nTaffy and popcorn--so with cheers they went."}
