{"subject": "The True Heroes : Or, The Noble Army Of Martyrs", "text": "You who love a tale of glory,\nListen to the song I sing:\nHeroes of the Christian story \nAre the heroes I shall bring.\n\nWarriors of the world, avaunt!\nOther heroes me engage;\n'Tis not such as you I want,\nSaints and Martyrs grace my page.\n\nWarriors who the world o'ercame\nWere in brother's blood imbrued;\nWhile the saints of purer fame,\nGreater far themselves subdued.\n\nFearful Christian! hear with wonder,\nOf the Saints of whom I tell;\nSome were burnt, some sawn asunder,\nSome by fire or torture fell;\n\nSome to savage beasts were hurl'd,\nOne escaped the lion's den;\nWas a persecuting world\nWorthy of these wondrous men?\n\nSome in fiery furnace thrown,\nYet escaped, unsinged their hair;\nThere Almighty power was shown,\nFor the Son of God was there.\n\nLet us crown with deathless fame\nThose who scorn'd and hated fell;\nMartyrs met contempt and shame,\nFearing nought but sin and hell.\n\nHow the shower of stones descended,\nHoly Stephen, on thy head!\nWhile his tongue the truth defended,\nHow the glorious Martyr bled!\n\nSee his fierce reviler Saul,\nHow he rails with impious breath!\nThen observe converted Paul\nOft in perils, oft in death.\n\n'Twas that God, whose sovereign power\nDid the lion's fury 'suage,\nCould alone, in one short hour,\nStill the persecutor's rage.\n\nE'en a woman - women hear,\nRead in Maccabees the story,\nConquer'd nature, love, and fear,\nTo obtain a crown of glory.\n\nSeven stout sons she saw expire,\n(How the mother's soul was pain'd!)\nSome by sword, and some by fire,\n(How the Martyr was sustain'd!)\n\nE'en in death's acutest anguish\nEach the tyrant still defy'd;\nEach she saw in torture languish,\nLast of all the mother died.\n\nMartyrs who were thus arrested,\nIn their short but bright career,\nBy their blood the truth attested,\nProved their faith and love sincere.\n\nThough their lot was hard and lowly,\nThough they perish'd at the stake,\nNow they live with Christ in glory,\nSince they suffer'd for his sake.\n\nFierce and unbelieving foes\nBut their bodies could destroy;\nShort, though bitter were their woes,\nEverlasting is their joy."}
