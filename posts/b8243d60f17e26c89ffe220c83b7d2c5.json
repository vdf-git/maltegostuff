{"subject": "The Crescent Moon", "text": "Slipping softly through the sky \nLittle horned, happy moon, \nCan you hear me up so high? \nWill you come down soon? \n\nOn my nursery window-sill \nWill you stay your steady flight? \nAnd then float away with me \nThrough the summer night? \n\nBrushing over tops of trees, \nPlaying hide and seek with stars, \nPeeping up through shiny clouds \nAt Jupiter or Mars. \n\nI shall fill my lap with roses \nGathered in the milky way, \nAll to carry home to mother. \nOh! what will she say! \n\nLittle rocking, sailing moon, \nDo you hear me shout -- Ahoy! \nJust a little nearer, moon, \nTo please a little boy."}
