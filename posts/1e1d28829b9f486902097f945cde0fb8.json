{"subject": "Friend", "text": "She was great\nAnd belonged to the present time\nAnd had affinity with all bright horizons.\nAnd fathomed the language of the earth and water.\n\nHer voice\nSounded like the sad tone of truth.\nHer eyelids\nPointed \nTo the heartbeats of elements.\nHer fingers\nLeafed through\nThe generous air.\nAnd she directed kindness\nTowards our hearts.\n\nShe was the image of her solitude.\nAnd for the mirror she interpreted\nThe most amorous moments of her own Time.\nLike rain, she was full of fresh repetitions.\nAnd like the trees\nShe grew with the blessing of light.\n\nShe called out the wind's childhood.\nAnd tied the strings of words\nTo the latch of water.\nAnd one night she enunciated\nThe Green Message of Love\nSo vividly\nThat we touched the emotion of the earth\nAnd felt fresh like a bucket of murmuring water.\n\nAgain and again we saw her\nBasket in hand\nGoing to pluck a cluster of glad tidings.\n\nAlas, \nShe failed to sit in full view of the pigeons\nAnd walked to the brink of Nil\nAnd stretched out beyond the patient Lights.\nAnd she did not mind at all \nHow lonely we would feel\nTo eat apples\nAt the intervals of the distressing closing of doors! \n(Translated by Ismail Salami)"}
