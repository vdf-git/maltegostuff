{"subject": "Beautiful Chantel", "text": "I remember your smile, \nAnd your curly brown hair, \nHaven't seen you for a while, \nBut I hope you know I care.\n\nMy life has been laborious, \nCruel to say the least, \nMy reputation notorious, \nA character decreased.\n\nBut you have  never judged me, \nYou've only shown me love, \nYour actions have made me free, \nA chain reaction thereof.\n\nYou're a lady of truth and honour, \nA humble quiet soul, \nContinue to endeavour, \nYou will eventually reach your goal.\n\nI wish you the best for always, \nMy dearest and lovely Chantel, \nBe blessed in all your pathways, \nReach high and forever be well."}
