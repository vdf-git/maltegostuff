{"subject": "Fide Et Literis", "text": "When the long--clouded spirit of Europe drew\nLife from Greek springs, frost could no longer bind,\nAnd old truth shone like fresh dawn on the blind,\nOur Founder sowed his pregnant seed: he knew\nNo crabbed rule but rather chose a clue\nThat should emband us of our historied kind\nComrades, and keep in us a morning mind,\nSince to the wise Learning is always New.\n\nIn Faith and Letters he enshrined his light;\nFaith, the divine adventure that holds on\nThrough this world's forest into worlds unknown,\nAnd Letters, that since speech on earth began\nAs one unended sentence burning write\nThe hope, the triumph, and the tears of Man."}
