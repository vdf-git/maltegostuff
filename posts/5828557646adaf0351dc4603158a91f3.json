{"subject": "Oh Your Gaze, That Slicing Sabre", "text": "Oh your gaze, that slicing sabre,\nAnd your eyes, those of a hero,\nThis, my life's become a prison,\n\nYour two locks are like two dragons,\nAll the others cower, fear you,\nLike the autumn leaves they quiver,\nCringe before you, dauntless hero.\n\nMeeting you made life eternal,\nSeparation's got me jealous,\nNight and day I seek salvation,\nBegging one more time to see you.\n\nIn your harshness I take pleasure,\nIn your glance, I find salvation,\nYearning for you's my affliction,\nNone else on earth do I long for.\n\nOh my love, Nezim's religion,\nPerfect beauty, Nezim's logic,\nYou are Nezim's balm and healing,\nLife without you is but heartache."}
