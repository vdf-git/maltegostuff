{"subject": "Wealth", "text": "(For Aline) \n\nFrom what old ballad, or from what rich frame\n Did you descend to glorify the earth?\nWas it from Chaucer's singing book you came?\n Or did Watteau's small brushes give you birth? \n\nNothing so exquisite as that slight hand\n Could Raphael or Leonardo trace.\nNor could the poets know in Fairyland\n The changing wonder of your lyric face. \n\nI would possess a host of lovely things,\n But I am poor and such joys may not be.\nSo God who lifts the poor and humbles kings\n Sent loveliness itself to dwell with me."}
