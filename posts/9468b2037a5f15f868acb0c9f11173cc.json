{"subject": "Vignette - Viii", "text": "_The Spanish Lady's Farewell_, 1809.\nManuel, I do not shed a tear,\nOur parting to delay!\nI dare not listen to my fear!\nI dare not bid thee stay!\n\nThe heart may shrink, the spirit fail,\nBut Spaniards must be free;\nAnd pride and duty shall prevail\nO'er all my love for thee!\n\nThen go! and round that gallant head,\nLike banners in the air,\nShall float full many a daring hope,\nAnd many a tender prayer!\n\nShould freedom perish--at thy death,\n'T'were folly to repine--\nAnd I should every feeling lose,\nExcept the wish for mine!\n\nBut if the destiny of Spain,\nBe once again to rise,\nOh! grant me heaven, to read the tale,\nIn Manuel's joyful eyes!"}
