{"subject": "The U-Boat Crew", "text": "ALAS, alas for those blond boys who stalk\nTheir prey in ambush of the shuddering seas,\nWhiling the wait with merry, tender talk\nOf some dear knot of flower-clad cottages\nBeyond the Rhine! The merchantship draws on;\nTheir swift torpedo strikes its mark; the sea\nMoans with the dying; for a victory won\nThey thank the pagan god of Germany.\nHappier to die the hideous, smothering death,\nToo deep for mercy, in their own snared trap,\nThan live to learn how time interpreteth\nThe cause they served; the tragical mishap\nOf pride that pledged The Day and brought The Night;\n\u2014Than live to loathe their Fatherland, a name\nSo high, so fallen, that betrayed their bright\nYoung loyalty to savageries of shame."}
