{"subject": "Mother.- Alpha And Omega.", "text": "Mother! Mother!\n  The startled cry of childish fright\n  Rang through the silence of the night,\n  As but the mother's fond caress\n  Could soothe its infantile distress;\n  And the mother answered, with loving stroke\n  Of her gentle hand, as she softly spoke:\n  'Hush, hush, my child, that troubled cry;\n  What evil can harm thee, with mother nigh?'\n\nMother! Mother!\n  Long years have passed, and the fevered brow\n  Of a bearded man, she is stroking now,\n  As through delirium and pain\n  He cries as a little child, again.\n  And the mother answered, with loving stroke\n  Of her careworn hand, as she softly spoke:\n  'Hush, hush, my child, that troubled cry;\n  What evil can harm thee, with mother nigh?'\n\nMother! Mother!\n  Still time rolls on, and an old man stands\n  Trembling on life's declining sands;\n  As memory bridges the flood of years\n  He cries as a child, with childish tears;\n  And memory answers, with loving stroke\n  Of a vanished hand, and an echo spoke:\n  'Hush, hush, my child, that troubled cry;\n  What evil can harm thee, with mother nigh?'"}
