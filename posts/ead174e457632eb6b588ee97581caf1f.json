{"subject": "Speak", "text": "Speak, your lips are free.\nSpeak, it is your own tongue.\nSpeak, it is your own body.\nSpeak, your life is still yours.\n\nSee how in the blacksmith's shop\nThe flame burns wild, the iron glows red; \nThe locks open their jaws, \nAnd every chain begins to break.\n\nSpeak, this brief hour is long enough\nBefore the death of body and tongue: \nSpeak, 'cause the truth is not dead yet, \nSpeak, speak, whatever you must speak.\n\nTranslated by Azfar Hussain\n\nPosted By Muhammad Atif Ch."}
