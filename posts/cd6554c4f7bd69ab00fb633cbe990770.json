{"subject": "A Young Rebel", "text": "The sun is setting behind the range,\nhis golden rays pour down\nOn a little figure, childish, strange,\nBending over a volume worn,\nWhose green-clad cover, dusty and torn,\nBears a 'harp without a crown'.\n\nThe young eyes turn to the distant west,\nWhere the sunset colours glow,\nAnd thoughts are thrilling the childish breast\nOf gallant, valorous deeds long done,\nOf glorious battles, fought and won\nIn the days of long ago.\n\nHis fancy peoples the lonely glen\nWith the ghosts of the vanished past,\nTill he hears the tramp of armed men,\nAnd O'Niall's plumed horsemen ridge\nWhile the 'Red Hand' flutters in all its pride\nAbove them on the blast.\n\nAnd just where the road winds into the creek\nWhere the jasmine stars the shade,\nWith the soft wind kissing her blushful cheek,\nBeautiful grey-eyed Dierdrie stands\nStretching to Naisi her snowy hands--\nHalf -welcoming, half- dismayed.\n\nThe purple hues of the gully change\nWith the deepening shades of night,\nAnd, far in a nook of the distant range\nIs Michael Dwyer, of the Wicklow glen,\nHolding his desperate stand again,\n'Gainst the redcoat soldier's might.\n\nThe west wind rises across the creek,\nAnd with it the crash of steel\nCarries a flush to the listener's cheek\u2014\n'Tis only the crash of branches dry,\nBut in it he hears the battle-cry,\nAnd the patriot's words of zeal.\n\nAnd martyred shades come thronging around,\nTo the roll-call of Liberty;\nLouder their eager voices sound,\nTill towering tree-tops and glowing sky,\nAre echoing back the defiant cry----\n'Michael answer for me!'\n\nThe moon is rising above the creek,\nThe shining stars look down\nOn a little dreamer, whose pillowed cheek\nRests, in a volume worn,\nWhose green-clad cover, dusty and torn,\nBears ' Harp without a Crown'."}
