{"subject": "The Cave", "text": "In the cave\n Of all my feelings\n Where this deepest thoughts can dwell\n Are the beginnings of my healings\n And the depths of living hell\n\n Whatever path I choose\n Will come from that deep source\n And whether I win or lose\n I have solely chosen the course\n\n Who knows what's in that brew\n That mix of happy and sad\n I haven't the slightest clue\n And it could be good or bad\n\n There comes a time for action\n A time to move and do\n Whatever the satisfaction\n It comes from the primal brew"}
