{"subject": "To Leuconoee", "text": "Seek not, Leuconoee, to know how long you're going to live yet,\nWhat boons the gods will yet withhold, or what they're going to give yet;\nFor Jupiter will have his way, despite how much we worry,--\nSome will hang on for many a day, and some die in a hurry.\nThe wisest thing for you to do is to embark this diem\nUpon a merry escapade with some such bard as I am.\nAnd while we sport I'll reel you off such odes as shall surprise ye;\nTo-morrow, when the headache comes,--well, then I'll satirize ye!"}
