{"subject": "it's midnight almost and I silently stare", "text": "it's midnight almost and I silently stare \ninto the blackness before me, no image of the\nday left, no dream left of the night, pretty\nor melancholy, as if time came to a standstill\n\nin vain I strive to reawaken the image of your face\nin vain all recollections, as if they'd broken loose\nthe twitching of hands reverberating through the dark\nand the sighs, the beloved words\n\nI want, at least, to recall the feeling\nthe last trace of beauty after love is over\nthe smell, the taste; abysmal emptiness\n\nwafts up to me as I stand on the vast\nwhite sand of the shore and the fog falls\nand I do not see, do not feel anything anymore.\n\nTranslation: 2002, Mia Dintinjana and Phillis Levin"}
