{"subject": "Ne\u00e6ra's Wreath", "text": "Ne\u00e6ra crowns me with a purple wreath\nThat she with her own dainty hands did twine;\nGold-hearted blossoms and blue buds in sheath,\nMingled with veined green leaves of the wild vine.\n\nThen, bending down her bright head, ah, too nigh!\nShe asks me for a song: the daylight dies:\nThe song is still unwritten: still I lie\nWatching the purple twilight of her eyes.\n\nI am her laureate; therefore heart of grace\nI take to kiss her. Where was song like this?\nLove is best sung of in a loveless place,\nFor who would care to sing where he might kiss?"}
