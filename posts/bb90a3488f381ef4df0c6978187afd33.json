{"subject": "Hemlock And Cedar", "text": "THIN sheets of blue smoke among white slabs ... near the shingle mill ... winter morning.\nFalling of a dry leaf might be heard ... circular steel tears through a log.\nSlope of woodland ... brown ... soft ... tinge of blue such as pansy eyes.\nFarther, field fires ... funnel of yellow smoke ... spellings of other yellow in corn stubble.\nBobsled on a down-hill road ... February snow mud ... horses steaming ... Oscar the driver sings ragtime under a spot of red seen a mile ... the red wool yarn of Oscar's stocking cap is seen from the shingle mill to the ridge of hemlock and cedar."}
