{"subject": "Deaf", "text": "As to a bird\u2019s song she were listening,\nHer beautiful head is ever sidewise bent;\nHer questioning eyes lift up their depths intent\u2014\nShe, who will never hear the wild-birds sing.\nMy words within her ears\u2019 cold chambers ring\nFaint, with the city\u2019s murmurous sub-tones blent,\nThough with such sounds as suppliants may have sent\nTo high-throned goddesses, my speech takes wing.\n\nNot for the side-poised head's appealing grace\nI gaze, nor hair where fire in shadow lies\u2014\nFor her this world's unhallowed noises base\nMelt into silence; not our groans, our cries,\nOur curses reach that high-removed place\nWhere dwells her spirit, innocently wise."}
