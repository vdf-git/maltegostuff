{"subject": "The Tortoise In Eternity", "text": "Within my house of patterned horn \nI sleep in such a bed \nAs men may keep before they're born \nAnd after when they're dead.\n\nSticks and stones may break their bones, \nAnd words may make them bleed; \nThere is not one of them who owns \nAn armour to his need.\n\nTougher than hide or lozenged bark, \nSnow-storm and thunder proof, \nAnd quick with sun, and thick with dark, \nIs this my darling roof.\n\nMen's troubled dreams of death and birth \nPuls mother-o'-pearl to black; \nI bear the rainbow bubble Earth \nSquare on my scornful back."}
