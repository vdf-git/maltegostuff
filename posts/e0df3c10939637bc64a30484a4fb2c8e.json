{"subject": "Brittle Beauty", "text": "Brittle beauty that nature made so frail,\nWhereof the gift is small, and short the season,\nFlowering today, tomorrow apt to fail,\nTickle\ntreasure, abhorred of reason, \nDangerous to deal with, vain, of none avail,\nCostly in keeping, passed not worth two peason\n, \nSlipper\nin sliding as is an eel's tail, \nJewel of jeopardy that peril doth assail,\nFalse and untrue, enticed oft to treason,\nEnemy to youth: that most may I bewail.\nAh, bitter sweet: infecting as the poison,\nThou farest as fruit that with the frost is taken: \nToday ready ripe, tomorrow all to-shaken\n."}
