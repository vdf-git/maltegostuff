{"subject": "The Dance", "text": "She is young. Have I the right\nEven to name her? Child,\nIt is not love I offer\nYour quick limbs, your eyes;\nOnly the barren homage\nOf an old man whom time\nCrucifies. Take my hand\nA moment in the dance,\nIgnoring its sly pressure,\nThe dry rut of age,\nAnd lead me under the boughs\nOf innocence. Let me smell\nMy youth again in your hair."}
