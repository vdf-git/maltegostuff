{"subject": "Xcvii A Superscription", "text": "Look in my face; my name is Might-have-been;\n         I am also call'd No-more, Too-late, Farewell;\n         Unto thine ear I hold the dead-sea shell\n     Cast up thy Life's foam-fretted feet between;\n     Unto thine eyes the glass where that is seen\n         Which had Life's form and Love's, but by my spell\n         Is now a shaken shadow intolerable,\n     Of ultimate things unutter'd the frail screen.\n\n     Mark me, how still I am! But should there dart\n       One moment through thy soul the soft surprise\n       Of that wing'd Peace which lulls the breath of sighs,--\n   Then shalt thou see me smile, and turn apart\n   Thy visage to mine ambush at thy heart\n       Sleepless with cold commemorative eyes."}
