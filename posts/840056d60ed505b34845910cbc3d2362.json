{"subject": "Song From The Spanish Of Iglesias", "text": "Alexis calls me cruel;\nThe rifted crags that hold\nThe gathered ice of winter,\nHe says, are not more cold.\n\nWhen even the very blossoms\nAround the fountain's brim,\nAnd forest walks, can witness\nThe love I bear to him.\n\nI would that I could utter\nMy feelings without shame;\nAnd tell him how I love him,\nNor wrong my virgin fame.\n\nAlas! to seize the moment\nWhen heart inclines to heart,\nAnd press a suit with passion,\nIs not a woman's part.\n\nIf man comes not to gather\nThe roses where they stand,\nThey fade among their foliage;\nThey cannot seek his hand."}
