{"subject": "To My Misery", "text": "O Misery of mine, no other\nIn faithfulness can match with thee,\nThou more than friend, and more than brother,\nThe only thing that cares for me!\n\nWhere'er I turn, are unkind faces,\nAnd hate and treachery and guile,\nThou, Mis'ry, in all times and places,\nDost greet me with thy pallid smile.\n\nAt birth I found thee waiting for me,\nI knew thee in my cradle first,\nThe same small eyes and dim watched o'er me,\nThe same dry, bony fingers nursed.\n\nAnd day by day when morning lightened,\nTo school thou led'st me--home did'st bring,\nAnd thine were all the blooms that brightened\nThe chilly landscape of my spring.\n\nAnd, thou my match and marriage monger,\nThe marriage deed by thee was read;\nThe hands foretelling need and hunger\nWere laid in blessing on my head.\n\nThy love for me shall last unshaken,\nNo further proof I ask, for when\nMy hopes for aye were from me taken,\nMy Mis'ry, thou wert with me then;\n\nAnd still, while sorrow's storm is breaking\nAbove me, and my head I bow--\nThe kindly and the unforsaking,\nOh Mis'ry, thou art with me now.\n\nAy, still from out Fate's gloomy towers\nI see thee come to me again,\nWith wreaths of everlasting flowers,\nAnd songs funereal in thy train.\n\nAnd when life's curses rock me nightly,\nAnd hushed I lie in slumber's hold,\nThy sable form comes treading lightly\nTo wrap me in its garments fold.\n\nThy brother let me be, and wholly\nRepay thee all I owe, tho' late:\nMy aching heart, my melancholy,\nMy songs to thee I dedicate."}
