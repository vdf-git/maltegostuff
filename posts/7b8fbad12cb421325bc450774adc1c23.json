{"subject": "Cantering In", "text": "A mindful man, but hearted like a child,\nLived near my dwelling; he was frank and glad,\nThough many sorrows might have made him sad;\nBut, to say sooth, his cheerfulness beguiled\nThe way of life so well, that trouble's power\nWas half unheeded, like a passing shower:\nStill as he went he sang, hoping the best,\nAnd restless energy claim'd every hour,\nAnd with a buoyant spirit he was blest.\nOne day we rode together on the grass,\nTalking of bygone years and all the rest,\nSo look'd-for and so swiftly seen to pass,\nWhen, as my gloomier spirit sigh'd Alas!\nThus to his pony's canter keeping time\nHis heart exulting pour'd itself in rhyme:-\n\n'Huzza,- huzza!\nFor so much thrown behind my back,\nAnd so many patches of light on my track,\nAnd so much done, and so much won,\nAnd life's race hitherto honestly run,\nFor honour and hope, and enough, and to spare,\nAnd perfect Providence everywhere,-\nFor peace and pleasure by nights and days,\nHuzza! give God the praise!\n\n'Huzzah for the past, whatever betide;\nHuzza! in piety, not in pride:\nGrateful and glad may the spirit be seen,\nAnd humble at heart though triumphant in mien,\nWhile Sincerity sings right out\nWhere Vanity lying would darken with doubt,-\nFor happiness, honour, and help always,\nHuzza! give God the praise!\n\n'Yes,- for friends on every shore,\nLoving and blessing us more and more,-\nYes,- for a sowing in every clime,\nTo bud and to bear to the end of time,-\nYes,- for a reaping rare and good,\nA heavenly harvest of angels' food,\nMercies, comforts, pardoning love,\nAnd grace upon earth, and glory above,\nO friend! with me our chorus raise,\nHuzza! give God the praise!'"}
