{"subject": "Let\u2019s Be Fools To-Night -", "text": "We, three men of commerce,\nStriving wealth to raise,\nSee but little promise\nIn the coming days;\nThough our hearts are brittle,\nHardened near to stone,\nWe can think a little\nOf the seasons flown.\n\nLily days and rose days:\nYouthful days so bright;\nWe were fools in those days,\nLet\u2019s be fools to-night.\n\nWe, three men of commerce,\nMen of business we,\nGave but little promise\nOf what we would be\nWhen we wandered urchins\u2014\nFoes of law and rule\u2014\nFearing only birchings\nAnd the village school.\n\nLily days and rose days,\nBoyhood\u2019s days so bright;\nWe were fools in those days,\nLet\u2019s be fools to-night.\n\nWe, three men of commerce,\nMen of business we,\nGave but little promise\nOf ability\nWhen we lived in riot;\nNever drew the line,\nHating peace and quiet,\nLoving maids and wine.\n\nDays when money goes\u2014days\nWhen men\u2019s hearts are right;\nWe were fools in those days,\nLet\u2019s be fools to-night.\n\nWe must wear to-morrow\nAll our worldly marks,\nCalm looks for our sorrow,\nStern looks for our clerks,\nWho, from trouble shrinking,\nTasting earthly joys,\nHate us, little thinking\nEver we were boys.\n\nDays when kindness flows\u2014days\nWhen men\u2019s hearts are white;\nWe\u2019ve been wise since those days,\nLet\u2019s be fools to-night."}
