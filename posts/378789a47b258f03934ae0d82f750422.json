{"subject": "Xxi", "text": "Say over again, and yet once over again,\nThat thou dost love me. Though the word repeated\nShould seem ' a cuckoo-song,' as thou dost treat it,\nRemember, never to the hill or plain,\nValley and wood, without her cuckoo-strain\nComes the fresh Spring in all her green completed.\nBeloved, I, amid the darkness greeted\nBy a doubtful spirit-voice, in that doubt's pain\nCry, ' Speak once more--thou lovest ! ' Who can fear\nToo many stars, though each in heaven shall roll,\nToo many flowers, though each shall crown the year ?\nSay thou dost love me, love me, love me--toll\nThe silver iterance !--only minding, Dear,\nTo love me also in silence with thy soul."}
