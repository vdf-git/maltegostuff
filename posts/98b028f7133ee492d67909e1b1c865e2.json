{"subject": "April", "text": "April, half-clad in flowers and showers,\nWalks, like a blossom, o'er the land;\nShe smiles at May, and laughing takes\nThe rain and sunshine hand in hand.\n\nSo gay the dancing of her feet,\nSo like a garden her soft breath,\nSo sweet the smile upon her face,\nShe charms the very heart of death.\n\nThe young moon in a trance she holds\nCaptive in clouds of orchard bloom,\nShe snaps her fingers at the grave,\nAnd laughs into the face of doom.\n\nYet in her gladness lurks a fear,\nIn all her mirth there breathes a sigh,\nSo soon her pretty flowers are gone-\nAnd ah! she is too young to die!"}
