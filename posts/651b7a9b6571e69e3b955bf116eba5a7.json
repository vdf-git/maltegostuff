{"subject": "Light", "text": "Wide is the heart as this world is wide.\n Deep is the heart to the other side\n We, with care can make ours grow strong.\n Love is one key; let it thrive for the throng.\n What may be good for all begins with one;\n Carried on wings, up, up, high as the sun,\n Into each crevice, into every action.\n Gentleness a key that brings satisfaction,\n Leading commitment to truth and to cheer.\n Bringing light to all, bringing no fear.\n Thankfulness, worship, and praise to this light,\n Vowing to fight for no less than the right."}
