I placed a half-filled glass \nin Southampton and the island rose \n      around that glass: the studio, Anne \nin the doorway come to see\n      me, and out the window the pink\nand purple Canterbury bells and foxglove.\n\n      Jimmy planted those. Do you recognize\nthe morning harbor's pink, cerulean, \n      pale orange? It was always clear to me\nthis tree outside my studio was only \n      eight strokes of white touched with gray,\nso I painted it that way."}
