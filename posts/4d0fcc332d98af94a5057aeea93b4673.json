{"subject": "Marijuana murdered him", "text": "Noon\nA gray rainy day\u2014\nOn a road less traveled the patrol tracked down much:\n\nHim (him is now an it, a crumpled cruel corpse for women\nTo beat their breasts about): the wreckage (four black wheels\nThat speak of despair and a mangled red car-body awash yet\nSoiled and the cold apparitions of smoked glass and steel):\nThe crime record\u2014\n\nHe stole at home he found no work he pimped his sis he\nMortgaged his mom he raped a girl (the myth reads so: like\nA crow calling its kindred he invited the last of his friends to\nJoin the feast, the fest, yes the plunder between her thighs)\nHe stabbed his professor dad he lived on air and alcohol\nAnd insulin and morphine\u2014but it was the marijuana that\nMurdered him as he screamed at the vengeful rain that\nTeased away his nirvana, the excuse of an existence. . .\n\nNo pair of exacting eyes to see the trees drive into a rage into\nHis car that once swallowed whole black roads but for the\nGod on his dashboard temple who had since returned to\nFormlessness, to a hundred and eight tiny crystals that held\nPsychedelic rainbows that outshone all the trapped sun. . ."}
