{"subject": "The tale of me", "text": "The child's teeth click against the marble. \nHer ear is crushed cold against the slab, \nThe dredged flour almost brushed by her hair \nShe traces with her eye her mother's hand. \n\nThe hand squashes flour and eggs to hide the yeast \nAnd again it folds and wraps away \nThe breathing, slackening, raw loaf \nThat tried to grow and was twisted and turned back - \n\nLike the man in the next room \nWrapped as Adam in broad leaves, \nHiding under the folded mountains that fell on him \nWhen he called them to come and cover him over. \n\nHe lies folded around \nThe pain salting his belly and gut, \nLies still groaning: I am not I, \nMy story is knotted and \nSour like the bread she made."}
