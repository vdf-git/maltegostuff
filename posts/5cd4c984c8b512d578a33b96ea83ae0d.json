{"subject": "The Church Of Unbent Knees", "text": "AS I went by the church to-day \nI heard the organ cry; \nAnd goodly folk were on their knees, \nBut I went striding by.\n\nMy minister hath a roof more vast: \nMy aisles are oak-trees high; \nMy altar-cloth is on the hills, \nMy organ is the sky.\n\nI see my rood upon the clouds, \nThe winds, my chanted choir; \nMy crystal windows, heaven-glazed, \nAre stained with sunset fire.\n\nThe stars, the thunder, and the rain, \nWhite sands and purple seas- \nThese are His pulpit and His pew, \nMy God of Unbent Knees!"}
