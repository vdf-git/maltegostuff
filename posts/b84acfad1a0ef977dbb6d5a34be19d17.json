{"subject": "Love Conquer'D", "text": "I.\nThe childish god of love did sweare\n  Thus: By my awfull bow and quiver,\nYon' weeping, kissing, smiling pair,\nI'le scatter all their vowes i' th' ayr,\n  And their knit imbraces shiver.\n\n                    II.\nUp then to th' head with his best art\n  Full of spite and envy blowne,\nAt her constant marble heart,\nHe drawes his swiftest surest dart,\n  Which bounded back, and hit his owne.\n\n                    III.\nNow the prince of fires burnes;\n  Flames in the luster of her eyes;\nTriumphant she, refuses, scornes;\nHe submits, adores and mournes,\n  And is his votresse sacrifice.\n\n                    IV.\nFoolish boy! resolve me now\n  What 'tis to sigh and not be heard?\nHe weeping kneel'd, and made a vow:\nThe world shall love as yon' fast two;\n  So on his sing'd wings up he steer'd."}
