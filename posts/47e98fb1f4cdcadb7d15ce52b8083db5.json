{"subject": "Water!--Oh! Water For Me", "text": "Oh! water for me-bright water for me!\nAnd wine for the tremulous debauchee!\nIt cooleth the brow, it cooleth the brain,\nIt maketh the faint one strong again;\nIt comes o'er the sense like a breeze from the sea:\nAll freshness, like infant purity.\nOh water for me, bright water, for me!\nGive wine, give wine to the debauchee!\nFill to the brim! fill, fill to the brim!\nLet the flowing crystal kiss the rim:\nFor my hand is steady, my eye is true,\nFor I, like the flowers, drink nothing but dew.\nOh! water, bright water's a mine of wealth,\nAnd the ores it yieldeth are vigour and health.\nSo water, pure water for me, for me!\nAnd wine for the tremulous debauchee!\nWhen over the hills, like a gladsome bride,\nMorning walks forth in her beauty's pride,\nAnd leading a band of laughing hours,\nBrushes the dew from the nodding flowers,\nOh! cheerily then my voice is heard,\nMingling with that of the soaring bird,\nWho flingeth abroad his matins loud,\nAs he freshens his wing in the cold grey cloud.\nBut when evening has quitted her sheltering yew,\nDrowsily flying, and weaving anew,\nHer dusky meshes o'er land and sea,\nHow gently, oh Sleep, fall thy poppies on me!\nFor water I drink, pure, cold and bright,\nAnd my dreams are of heaven the live long night.\nSo, hurrah for thee, water, hurrah, hurrah!\nThou art silver and gold, thou art ribbon and star,\nHurrah for bright water! hurrah! hurrah!"}
