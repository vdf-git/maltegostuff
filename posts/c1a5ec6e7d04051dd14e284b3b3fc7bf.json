{"subject": "The Braes Of Yarrow", "text": "'Thy braes were bonny, Yarrow stream!\nWhen first on them I met my lover;\nThy braes how dreary, Yarrow stream!\nWhen now thy waves his body cover.\nForever now, O Yarrow Stream!\nThou art to me a stream of sorrow;\nFor never on thy banks shall I\nBehold my love, the flower of Yarrow.\n\n'He promised me a milk-white steed,\nTo bear me to his father's bowers;\nHe promised me a little page,\nTo squire me to his father's towers;\nHe promised me a wedding-ring, \nThe wedding-day was fixed to-morrow;\nNow he is wedded to his grave,\nAlas, his watery grave, in Yarrow!\n\n'Sweet were his words when last we met;\nMy passion I as freely told him!\nClasped in his arms, I little thought\nThat I should nevermore behold him!\nScarce was he gone, I saw his ghost;\nIt vanished with a shriek of sorrow;\nThrice did the water-wraith ascend,\nAnd gave a doleful groan through Yarrow.\n\n'His mother from the window looked\nWith all the longing of a mother;\nHis little sister weeping walked\nThe greenwood path to meet her brother.\nThey sought him east, they sought him west,\nThey sought him all the forest thorough;\nThey only saw the cloud of night,\nThey only heard the roar of Yarrow!\n\n'No longer from thy window look,\nThou hast no son, thou tender mother!\nNo longer walk, thou lovely maid;\nAlas, thou hast no more a brother!\nNo longer seek him east or west.\nAnd search no more the forest thorough\nFor, wandering in the night so dark,\nHe fell a lifeless corpse in Yarrow.\n\n'The tear shall never leave my cheek,\nNo other youth shall be my marrow;\nI'll seek thy body in the stream,\nAnd then with thee I'll sleep in Yarrow.'\nThe tear did never leave her cheek,\nNo other youth became her marrow:\nShe found his body in the stream,\nAnd now with him she sleeps in Yarrow."}
