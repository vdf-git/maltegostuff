{"subject": "Pytheas", "text": "Gaul whose keel in far, dim ages ploughed wan widths of polar sea\u2014\nGray old sailor of Massilia, who hath woven wreath for thee?\nWho amongst the world\u2019s high singers ever breathed the tale sublime\nOf the man who coasted England in the misty dawn of time?\nLeaves of laurel, lights of music\u2014these and these have never shed\nGlory on the name unheard of, lustre on the vanished head.\nLords of song, and these are many, never yet have raised the lay\nFor the white, wind-beaten seaman of a wild, forgotten day.\nHarp of shining son of Godhead still is as a voice august;\nBut the man who first saw Britain sleeps beneath unnoticed dust. \nFrom the fair, calm bays Hellenic, from the crescents and the bends,\nRound the wall of crystal Athens, glowing in gold evening-ends,\nSailed abroad the grand, strong father, with his face towards the snow\nOf the awful northern mountains, twenty centuries ago.\nOn the seas that none had heard of, by the shores where none had furled\nWing of canvas, passed this elder to the limits of the world.\nLurid limits, loud with thunder and the roar of flaming cone,\nGhastly tracts of ice and whirlwind lying in a dim, blind zone,\nBitter belts of naked region, girt about by cliffs of fear,\nWhere the Spirit of the Darkness dwells in heaven half the year. \n\nYea, against the wild, weird Thule, steered the stranger through the gates\nOpened by a fire eternal, into tempest-trampled straits\u2014\nThule, lying like a nightmare on the borders of the Pole:\nNeither land, nor air, nor water, but a mixture of the whole!\nDumb, dead chaos, grey as spectre, now a mist and now a cloud,\nWhere the winds cry out for ever, and the wave is always loud.\nHere the lord of many waters, in the great exalted years,\nSaw the sight that no man knows of\u2014heard the sound that no man hears\u2014\nFelt that God was in the Shadow ere he turned his prow and sped\nTo the sweet green fields of England with the sunshine overhead. \n\nIn the day when pallid Persia fled before the Thracian steel,\nBy the land that now is London passed the strange Hellenic keel.\nUp the bends of quiet river, hard by banks of grove and flower,\nSailed the father through a silence in the old majestic hour.\nNot a sound of fin or feather, not a note of wave or breeze,\nVext the face of sleeping streamlets, broke the rest of stirless trees.\nNot a foot was in the forest, not a voice was in the wood,\nWhen the elder from Massilia over English waters stood.\nAll was new, and hushed, and holy\u2014all was pure untrodden space,\nWhen the lord of many oceans turned to it a reverent face. \n\nMan who knew resplendent Athens, set and framed in silver sea,\nDid not dream a dream of England\u2014England of the years to be!\nFriend of fathers like to Plato\u2014bards august and hallowed seers\u2014\nDid not see that tenfold glory, Britain of the future years!\nSpirit filled with Grecian music, songs that charm the dark away,\nOn that large, supreme occasion, did not note diviner lay\u2014\nDid not hear the voice of Shakespeare\u2014all the mighty life was still,\nDown the slopes that dipped to seaward, on the shoulders of the hill;\nBut the gold and green were brighter than the bloom of Thracian springs,\nAnd a strange, surpassing beauty shone upon the face of things. \n\nIn a grave that no man thinks of\u2014back from far-forgotten bays\u2014\nSleeps the grey, wind-beaten sailor of the old exalted days.\nHe that coasted Wales and Dover, he that first saw Sussex plains,\nPassed away with head unlaurelled in the wild Thessalian rains.\nIn a space by hand untended, by a fen of vapours blind,\nLies the king of many waters\u2014out of sight and out of mind!\nNo one brings the yearly blossom\u2014no one culls the flower of grace,\nFor the shell of mighty father buried in that lonely place;\nBut the winds are low and holy, and the songs of sweetness flow,\nWhere he fell asleep for ever, twenty centuries ago."}
