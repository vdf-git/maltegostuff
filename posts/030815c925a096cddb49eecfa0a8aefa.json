{"subject": "Wildflowers", "text": "Coleridge carefully wrote down a whole page \nof them, all beginning with the letter b. \nGuidebooks preserve our knowledge \nof their hues and shapes, their breeding. \nMany poems have made delicate word-chimes\u2014 \nlike wind-chimes not for wind but for the breath of man\u2014 \nout of their lovely names. \nAt the edge of the prairie in a cabin \nwhen thunder comes closer to thump the roof hard \na few of them\u2014in a corner, brittle in a dry jar \nwhere a woman's thoughtful hand left them to fade\u2014 \nseem to blow with the announcing winds outside \nas the rain begins to fall on all their supple kin \nof all colors, under a sky of one color, or none."}
