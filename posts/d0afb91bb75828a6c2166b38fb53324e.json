{"subject": "Aquae Sulis", "text": "The chimes called midnight, just at interlune,\nAnd the daytime talk on the Roman investigations\nWas checked by silence, save for the husky tune\nThe bubbling waters played near the excavations.\nAnd a warm air came up from underground,\nAnd a flutter, as of a filmy shape unsepulchred,\nThat collected itself, and waited, and looked around:\nNothing was seen, but utterances could be heard:\nThose of the goddess whose shrine was beneath the pile\nOf the God with the baldachined altar overhead:\n'And what did you get by raising this nave and aisle\nClose on the site of the temple I tenanted?\n'The notes of your organ have thrilled down out of view\nTo the earth-clogged wrecks of my edifice many a year,\nThough stately and shining once - ay, long ere you\nHad set up crucifix and candle here.\n'Your priests have trampled the dust of mine without rueing,\nDespising the joys of man whom I so much loved,\nThough my springs boil on by your Gothic arcades and pewing,\nAnd sculptures crude\u2026. Would Jove they could be removed!'\n' - Repress, O lady proud, your traditional ires;\nYou know not by what a frail thread we equally hang;\nIt is said we are images both - twitched by peoples desires;\nAnd that I, as you, fail as a song that men time agone sang!' . . . . . . .\n\nAnd the olden dark hid the cavities late laid bare,\nAnd all was suspended and soundless as before,\nExcept for a gossamery noise fading off in the air,\nAnd the boiling voice of the waters' medicinal pour."}
