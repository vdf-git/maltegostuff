{"subject": "Near Lanivet 1872", "text": "There was a stunted handpost just on the crest,\nOnly a few feet high:\nShe was tired, and we stopped in the twilight-time for her rest,\nAt the crossways close thereby.\n\nShe leant back, being so weary, against its stem,\nAnd laid her arms on its own,\nEach open palm stretched out to each end of them,\nHer sad face sideways thrown.\n\nHer white-clothed form at this dim-lit cease of day\nMade her look as one crucified\nIn my gaze at her from the midst of the dusty way,\nAnd hurriedly 'Don't,' I cried.\n\nI do not think she heard. Loosing thence she said,\nAs she stepped forth ready to go,\n'I am rested now.-Something strange came into my head;\nI wish I had not leant so!'\n\nAnd wordless we moved onward down from the hill\nIn the west cloud's murked obscure,\nAnd looking back we could see the handpost still\nIn the solitude of the moor.\n\n'It struck her too,' I thought, for as if afraid\nShe heavily breathed as we trailed;\nTill she said, 'I did not think how 'twould look in the shade,\nWhen I leant there like one nailed.'\n\nI, lightly: 'There's nothing in it. For YOU, anyhow!'\n-'O I know there is not,' said she . . .\n'Yet I wonder . . . If no one is bodily crucified now,\nIn spirit one may be!'\n\nAnd we dragged on and on, while we seemed to see\nIn the running of Time's far glass\nHer crucified, as she had wondered if she might be\nSome day.-Alas, alas!"}
