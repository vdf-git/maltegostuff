{"subject": "Another, Before Meat", "text": "Bless thou the victuals which now deck this board,\nImpart such nutriment to them, O Lord!\nThat they our bodies may invig'rate so, \nThat we may serve thee, as we ought to do. \n\nThough many of our meats are mighty nice,\nYet in them all no innate virtue lies\nTo feed us, or our hunger to repress,\nIf thou thyself didst not the creatures bless.\n\nPour then thy blessing on the gifts, O Lord!\nWherewith so freely thou hast crown'd this board;\nGive them nutritious juices from above\nTo feed us, and our hunger to remove.\n\nAs the varieties, whereon we feed,\nOft indigestions in our stomachs breed,\nAnd dangerous diseases oft arise,\nBecause we were intemp'rate and unwise:\n\nThy grace on us, most holy God! bestow\nThat we such temp'rance at our meals may show,\nThat our provisions hunger may appease,\nAnd neither cause distemper, or disease.\n\nInfuse thro' them, to us such pow'r and might,\nThat each of us may worship thee aright,\nAnd in his calling, thy bless'd name adore,\nFor Jesus' sake, who saves us by his pow'r."}
