{"subject": "Pipe Smoker", "text": "Because I love the soothing weed\n          And am of sober type,\nI'd choose me for a friend in need\n          A man who smokes a pipe.\nA cove who hasn't much to say,\n          And spits into the fire,\nPuffing like me a pipe of clay,\n          Corn-cob or briar.\n\nA chap original of thought,\n          With cheery point of view,\nWho has of gumption quite a lot,\n          And streaks of humour too.\nHe need not be a whiskered sage,\n          With wisdom over-ripe:\nJust give me in the old of age\n          A pal who smokes a pipe.\n\nA cigarette may make for wit,\n          Although I like it not;\nA good cigar, I must admit,\n          Gives dignity to thought.\nBut as my glass of grog I sip\n          I never, never gripe\nIf I have for companionship\n          A guy who smokes a pipe."}
