{"subject": "Love Is Blind", "text": "And can you tell me Love is blind\nBecause your faults he will not find,\nBecause the image that he sees\nIs one of splendid mysteries?\nAnd if he lack the power to look\nOn what he will, as on a book,\nAnd read therein the heart of it,\nWhy are his ways with wonder lit?\nWhy think you he should bind his eyes\nAnd hide the many-tinted skies,\nBut that he sees too well to trust\nThe shadows on an orb of dust?\nFor he hath vision keener far\nThan poring Thought's and Fancy's are\nAn inward vision, full and clear\nWhen night has flung her mantle sheer\nAcross the world we stumble through\nIn search of Truth's evasive clue.\nHe looks, and straight there fall away\nThe flutt'ring rags of your array,\nThe far-fet gem, th' indecent drape,\nThe pads that mar the perfect shape,\nAnd naked to his reverent view\nIs beauty's self, essential you."}
