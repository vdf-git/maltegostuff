{"subject": "It Was Upon", "text": "It was upon a July evening.\nAt a stile I stood, looking along a path\nOver the country by a second Spring\nDrenched perfect green again. 'The lattermath\nWill be a fine one.' So the stranger said,\nA wandering man. Albeit I stood at rest,\nFlushed with desire I was. The earth outspread,\nLike meadows of the future, I possessed.\n\nAnd as an unaccomplished prophecy\nThe stranger's words, after the interval\nOf a score years, when those fields are by me\nNever to be recrossed, now I recall,\nThis July eve, and question, wondering,\nWhat of the lattermath to this hoar Spring?"}
