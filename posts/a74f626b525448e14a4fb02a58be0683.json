Oh, yes, brisk enough,\nBut\u2014you know\u2014so uncouth.\n\u201cThere's Plato in the passage,\nThey tell me he's quite droll.\nHe says some devilish clever things;\nA heathen, though, poor soul . . . .\u201d\nThe governor of Glubbdubdrib\nResumes his drinking-cup.\nAs for the guests and visitors,\nThey hadn't even looked up."}
