{"subject": "Youth", "text": "A dead oak's branches hold a nest, \nAbandoned now, that ospreys built. \nHe wades the river; slow clouds spread \nAt each step from the bottom's silt. \nOr, his shirt bunched beneath his head, \nHe drowses as the breeze falls slack, \nAnd feels the grass he lies on pressed \nIn complex patterns on his back\n\nThough summer seems to pause with its \nHypnotic sluggishness and drouth, \nDownstream a railway bridge extends \nAcross the estuary's mouth; \nAnd, while the sliding water blends \nMercurial, flashing, glob-like fires, \nAbove the bridge a lineman sits \nHigh in his seat-sling, working wires."}
