{"subject": "What Man May Learn, What Man May Do", "text": "WHAT man may learn, what man may do,\nOf right or wrong of false or true,\nWhile, skipper-like, his course he steers\nThrough nine and twenty mingled years,\nHalf misconceived and half forgot,\nSo much I know and practise not.\n\nOld are the words of wisdom, old\nThe counsels of the wise and bold:\nTo close the ears, to check the tongue,\nTo keep the pining spirit young;\nTo act the right, to say the true,\nAnd to be kind whate'er you do.\n\nThus we across the modern stage\nFollow the wise of every age;\nAnd, as oaks grow and rivers run\nUnchanged in the unchanging sun,\nSo the eternal march of man\nGoes forth on an eternal plan."}
