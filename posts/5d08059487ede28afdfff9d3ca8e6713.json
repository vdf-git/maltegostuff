{"subject": "Like A Wall Against Intrusion", "text": "Like an ivory tower; like a sacred palace, \n Stood my old beloved room, \n Unaltered, like the face \n Of one who tended it at noon, \n Always, when the sun was hottest, \n For she knew best. \n It was Mother, standing like a queen, \n Who bade me come in. \n My eyes beheld every corner, every seam \n That held unknown beauty within \n These sacred walls of pinewood, \n Once, reminiscent of my boyhood. \n Like a Danish King; like an ivory tower, \n With a wall against intrusion, \n Peacefully thru' the golden hours \n I slept, oblivious of worldly confusion, \n Encompassed by majestic nobility \n Of things familiar, and of tranquility."}
