{"subject": "Wind Speaks", "text": "The Wind speaks ...in whispers when rustling playfully through the flowers of a field.  ...in wailing, banshee howls ... chilling and shivery on dark and stormy nights.  ...with soft, teasing laughter on bright days in spring.  ...with the icy shrieks of a frigid nor'easter--- telling the bitterness of its cold.  ...in breathy, sensuous tones that waft scents of sweet roses in bloom.  with gusty shouts of danger--- when nature has gone array.  in genteel accents...telling of  cool ocean breezes- country farmlands- or mountain meadows high-  ...of rivers and deserts,  wastelands, wetlands, and swamps.  \"The Wind Speaks\" of all of these as only The Wind can! Listen... in the stillness you will hear its eloquence!"}
