{"subject": "I Loved You", "text": "I loved you, and I probably still do,\nAnd for a while the feeling may remain...\nBut let my love no longer trouble you,\nI do not wish to cause you any pain.\nI loved you; and the hopelessness I knew,\nThe jealousy, the shyness - though in vain -\nMade up a love so tender and so true\nAs may God grant you to be loved again.\nTranslated by Genia Gurarie, 11/10/95"}
