The British must get out.\nOh, yes? And Hands off Belgium, too, no doubt.\nWe shall, of course, be better for your sermons:\nBut why not save some censure for the Germans?\nDecember 24, 1944\n\n3.\u2014For Whom it May Concern\nCheer up. We never thought that Peace\nWould all be song and dance.\nAnd what is happening in Greece\nMight have occurred in France.\nDecember 24, 1944"}
