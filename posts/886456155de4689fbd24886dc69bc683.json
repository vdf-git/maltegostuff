{"subject": "The Promise", "text": "She said to him, 'Unless, when I am dead\nFrom out the green sod of my lowly grave\nA crimson rose should rise and softly wave,\nWhispering words like those my poor heart said;\nUnless this token of a passion fled\nShould come to tell you all that you may crave,\nThen you shall know I loved you not! Be brave!\nThat rose shall bloom, and you be comforted.'\nBut when she died, not only in the Spring,\nWhen violets wake, and in the deeps of June,\nHer lover saw a red rose lightly blow;\nNot only did the golden Summer bring\nGifts for his heart, but 'neath the Winter moon\nA passion-flower trembled thro' the snow!"}
