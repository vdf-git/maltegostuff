{"subject": "The Little Cripple's Complaint", "text": "I'm a helpless cripple child, \nGentle Christians, pity me; \nOnce, in rosy health I smiled, \nBlithe and gay as you can be, \nAnd upon the village green\nFirst in every sport was seen. \n\nNow, alas! I'm weak and low,\nCannot either work or play; \nTottering on my crutches, slow, \nThus I drag my weary way: \nNow no longer dance and sing, \nGaily, in the merry ring. \n\nMany sleepless nights I live, \nTurning on my weary bed; \nSoftest pillows cannot give\nSlumber to my aching head; \nConstant anguish makes it fly\nFrom my heavy, wakeful eye. \n\nAnd, when morning beams return, \nStill no comfort beams for me: \nStill my limbs with fever burn,\nPainful still my crippled knee. \nAnd another tedious day\nPasses slow and sad away. \n\nFrom my chamber-window high, \nLifted to my easy-chair,\nI the village-green can spy, \nOnce I used to frolic there, \nMarch, or beat my new-bought drum; \nHappy times! no more to come. \n\nThere I see my fellows gay,\nSporting on the daisied turf,\nAnd, amidst their cheerful play, \nStopp'd by many a merry laugh; \nBut the sight I scarce can bear,\nLeaning in my easy-chair. \n\nLet not then the scoffing eye\nLaugh, my twisted leg to see: \nGentle Christians, passing by, \nStop awhile, and pity me, \nAnd for you I'll breathe a prayer, \nLeaning in my easy-chair."}
