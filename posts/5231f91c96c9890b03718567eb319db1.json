{"subject": "The Siren", "text": "The puppy must be learned of all this material.\nNo map of the hospital. First, the war effort.\nThen, the war itself. The water makes and remakes\nits walls. No persons or boats are allowed in them.\n\nThis plot is to be played out in the buildings known to us.\nSwim for the stick, baby! You've got an anti-sink device.\nThe nba guard flips forward and back\nin his hologram. Fish-fission. Light.\n                                                                            \u2014and found wheels beneath her\nlinen skirt. The kids mill around like businessmen-clowns.\nTheir organization is a matter of choice and thus not protected under\nreedlight. Candlelight.\n\nHorizonto-rotary gaze beating clearly to the right.\nNow, corrected, to the left. Fish! Flip! and Out of Hearing!\nAlone in the pink apartment with your little swab.\nThe moth-mom tries out everything at once: straps on wool,\nties a candle to her head. Don't pity her. She wants to eat the moth!\nWhich dithers over whether it eats wool or flame.\n\nThe skyline lifts, and the gulfstream slips out barefoot\nclear to England. Maidens rhinocently down the cowpath clomp.\nToothbrush into yogurt cup, Recyclamente! I am so\nadamant. The siren with a catch in its cry starts over.\nEternal transistance. Ent'ring our marriage ride."}
