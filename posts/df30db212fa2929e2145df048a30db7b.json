{"subject": "The Discreet Collector", "text": "Down south there is a curio-shop\n Unknown to many men;\nThereat do I intend to stop\n When I am south again;\nThe narrow street through which to go--\n Aha! I know it well!\nAnd may be you would like to know--\n But no--I will not tell!\n\n'T is there to find the loveliest plates\n (The bluest of the blue!)\nAt such surprisingly low rates\n You'd not believe it true!\nAnd there is one Napoleon vase\n Of dainty S\u00e8vres to sell--\nI'm sure you'd like to know that place--\n But no--I will not tell!\n\nThen, too, I know another shop\n Has old, old beds for sale,\nWith lovely testers up on top\n Carved in ornate detail;\nAnd there are sideboards rich and rare,\n With fronts that proudly swell--\nOh, there are bargains waiting there,\n But where I will not tell!\n\nAnd hark! I know a bottle-man\n Smiling and debonair,\nAnd he has promised me I can\n Choose of his precious ware!\nIn age and shape and color, too,\n His dainty goods excel--\nAha, my friends, if you but knew--\n But no! I will not tell!\n\nA thousand other shops I know\n Where bargains can be got--\nWhere other folk would like to go\n Who have what I have not.\nI let them hunt; I hold my mouth--\n Yes, though I know full well\nWhere lie the treasures of the south,\n I'm not a going to tell!"}
