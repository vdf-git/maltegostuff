{"subject": "Chorus Venetus", "text": "Sing praise to God, both young and olde, \nThat in this towne remaine, \nWith voice and euery instrument \nFound out by mortall braine. \n\nSing praises to our mightie God, \nPraise our deliuerer's name : \nOur louing Lord, who now in need \nHath kyth'd to be the same. \n\nThe faithles snares did compasse vs, \nTheir netts were sett about ; \nBut yet our dearest Father in heauen, \nHe hath redeem'd vs out. \n\nNot only that, but by his power \nOur enemies' feet they slaid, \nWhom he hath trapt, and made to fall \nInto the pit they made. \n\nSing praises then, both young and olde, \nThat in this town remaine, \nTo him that hath releeued our necks \nFrom Turkish yoak prophaine. \n\nLet vs wash off our sinnes impure, \nCast off his garments vile, \nAnd hant his temple euerie day, \nTo praise his name awhile. \n\nO praise him for the victorie, \nThat he hath made vs haue, \nFor he it was reueng'd our cause, \nAnd not our armies braue. \n\nPraise him with trumpet, piphre, and drumme, \nWith lutes and organes fine, \nWith viols, gitterne, cistiers als, \nAnd sweetest voices syne. \n\nSing praise, sing praise, both young and olde, \nSing praises one and all, \nTo him who hath redeem'd vs now \nFrom cruel pagans' thrall."}
