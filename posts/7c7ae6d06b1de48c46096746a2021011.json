{"subject": "Angel's Poem", "text": "Angels poem\n\nLove is lost as another is gained.\nForgotten feelings reawaken.\nHis heart she has taken.\nAnd others he has pained.\n\nNothing matters but her love.\nShe is so beautiful and sweet.\nEvery moment with her is a treat.\nThen she spreads her wings like a dove.\n\nReturning to heaven my angel is gone.\nand i am left here to silently die.\ni wait every day for her return from the sky.\nShe flies back with the waking dawn\n\nHe is so lucky to call her his baby.\nLeaving her is not a choice.\nBeing in her presence steals his voice.\nWill she ever love him? Maybe."}
