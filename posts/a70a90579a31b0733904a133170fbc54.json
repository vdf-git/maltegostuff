{"subject": "Searching", "text": "These quiet Autumn days, \n My soul, like Noah's dove, on airy wings\n Goes out and searches for the hidden things\nBeyond the hills of haze.\n\nWith mournful, pleading cries, \n Above the waters of the voiceless sea\n That laps the shore of broad Eternity, \nDay after day, it flies, \n\nSearching, but all in vain, \n For some stray leaf that it may light upon, \n And read the future, as the days agone -\nIts pleasures, and its pain.\n\nListening patiently\n For some voice speaking from the mighty deep, \n Revealing all the things that it doth keep\nIn secret there for me.\n\nCome back and wait, my soul! \n Day after day thy search has been in vain.\n Voiceles and silent o'er the future's plain\nIts mystic waters roll.\n\nGod, seeing, knoweth best, \n And in His time the waters shall subside, \n And thou shalt know what lies beneath the tide, \nThen wait, my soul, and rest."}
