{"subject": "Sonnet Xxxvii. To Winter. Written At Ampton, Suffolk.", "text": "Welcome, stern Winter, though thy brows are bound\nWith no fresh flowers, and ditties none thou hast\nBut the wild music of the sweeping blast;\nWelcome this chilly wind, that snatches round\nThe brown leaves in quaint eddies; we have long\nPanted in wearying heat; skies always bright,\nAnd dull return of never--clouded light,\nSort not with hearts that gather food for song.\nRather, dear Winter, I would forth with thee,\nWatching thee disattire the earth; and roam\nOn the bleak heaths that stretch about my home,\nTill round the flat horizon I can see\nThe purple frost--belt; then to fireside--chair,\nAnd sweetest labour of poetic care."}
