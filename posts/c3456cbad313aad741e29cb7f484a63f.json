{"subject": "Worship", "text": "I know a quite religious man\nWho utters praises when he can. \nNow I find God in bard and book,\nIn school and temple, bird and brook. \nBut he says God is sweetest of all\nDiscovered in a drinking-hall. \nFor God requires no costly wine\nBut comes on the foam of a crockery stein. \nAnd when that foam is on the lips,\nBegin then God's good fellowships. \nCathedrals, synagogues, and kirks\nMay go to the devil, and all their works. \nAnd as for Christian charity,\nIt's made out of hilarity. \nHe gives the beggar all his dimes,\nForgives his brother seven times. \n'I love the rain,' says thirsty clod;\nSo this religious man of God. \nFor God has come, and is it odd\nHe praises all the works of God? \n'For God has come, and there's no sorrow,'\nHe sings all night--will he sing to-morrow?"}
