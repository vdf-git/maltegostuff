{"subject": "I Held A Shelley Manuscript", "text": "My hands did numb to beauty\nas they reached into Death and tightened!\n\nO sovereign was my touch\nupon the tan-inks's fragile page!\n\nQuickly, my eyes moved quickly,\nsought for smell for dust for lace\nfor dry hair!\n\nI would have taken the page\nbreathing in the crime!\nFor no evidence have I wrung from dreams--\nyet what triumph is there in private credence?\n\nOften, in some steep ancestral book,\nwhen I find myself entangled with leopard-apples\nand torched-skin mushrooms,\nmy cypressean skein outreaches the recorded age\nand I, as though tipping a pitcher of milk,\npour secrecy upon the dying page."}
