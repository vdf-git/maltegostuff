{"subject": "Elegy, Imitated From One Of Akenside's Blank-Verse Inscriptions", "text": "Near the lone pile with ivy overspread,\nFast by the rivulet's sleep-persuading sound,\nWhere 'sleeps the moonlight' on yon verdant bed--\nO humbly press that consecrated ground!\n\nFor there does Edmund rest, the learned swain!\nAnd there his spirit most delights to rove:\nYoung Edmund! famed for each harmonious strain,\nAnd the sore wounds of ill-requited love.\n\nLike some tall tree that spreads its branches wide,\nAnd loads the west wind with its soft perfume,\nHis manhood blossomed: till the faithless pride\nOf fair Matilda sank him to the tomb.\n\nBut soon did righteous Heaven her guilt pursue!\nWhere'er with wildered step she wandered pale,\nStill Edmund's image rose to blast her view,\nStill Edmund's voice accused her in each gale.\n\nWith keen regret, and conscious guilt's alarms,\nAmid the pomp of affluence she pined;\nNor all that lured her faith from Edmund's arms\nCould lull the wakeful horror of her mind.\n\nGo, Traveller! tell the tale with sorrow fraught:\nSome tearful maid perchance, or blooming youth,\nMay hold it in remembrance; and be taught\nThat riches cannot pay for Love or Truth."}
