{"subject": "From &Quot;Naufel And Hatem&Quot;", "text": "I have seen many sprawling meadows,\nMany deserts, fields, forests and crowded cities.\nMany strange lands have I seen. Sometimes\nI have seen savage darkness swallowing up this world of ours\nLike that huge sea fish devouring the tired prophet Jonah.\nSometimes again I have seen the moving sun,\nBright and glorious, emerging from the prison of night\nLike the freed prophet Joseph coming out of the dark well of death.\nI have seen the sea bubbling with life, stretching from horizon to horizon,\nAnd mountains, standing erect, like the rocky spine of the true believer.\nI have known all and witnessed the rise and fall\nOf nations or crowds of men. I have seen\nGod's vast creation. Many hours have I spent\nIn the company of the wise in many lands,\nAnd in the association of meditating saints.\nBut still I find my thirst unquenched.\nIncomplete, unfulfilled, my heart seeks the fullness of life\nIn the midst of the wide wide world among countless men."}
