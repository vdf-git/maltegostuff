{"subject": "Farmington", "text": "Little, lovely, friendly town\nBright beneath your maple trees -\nWith your dooryards sending out\nLilac scent upon the breeze;\nThrough the hurried years, I trust,\nIn the changes you have made\nThat you kept your dooryards sweet,\nKept your arching trees for shade;\nKept the friendliness I knew\nIn the olden, golden days -\nKept your hands in welcome out,\nKept your neighborly, fine ways;\nWith your home lamps and your fires\nGlowing out upon each street\nFor the stranger in your midst\nPassing by on lonely feet;\nKept your small-town sympathy -\nKept your laughter and your tears...\nHave you kept them, little town\nThrough these difficult, hard years?\nIf you have, I think some day,\nLike a magnet strong and true,\nYou will reach across the miles\nAnd will draw me back to you."}
