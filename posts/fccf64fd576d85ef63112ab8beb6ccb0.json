{"subject": "Routine", "text": "A dark, handsome woman, worn out with child bearing\nand a wisp of a girl, in a torn frock-\nthey move in unison as they walk to work,\nmother and daughter, sharing intimate whispers,\nbarefoot, tinkling anklets, at the break of dawn.\nAt the sound of the car, the daughter turns,\ntransfixed.  It is a shining new sedan\nand its colour hurts the eyes in the early morning light.\nIt passes smartly, crunching the gravel underneath.\nGently, the mother draws the child away\nand urges her on to the daily routine."}
