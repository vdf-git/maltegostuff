{"subject": "You Roughly Love Me", "text": "You pull me down and roughly love me\n Then you quickly turn away\n Not a kind or tender word\n Do you ever have to say\n\n That's the way it's been for years now\n The same thing every night\n You take me then you leave me\n Just like turning out a light\n\n There's just one thing a missing\n In this love affair\n The feelings that I want and need\n The love we never share\n\n So keep this in your mind somewhere\n Someday it will surely be\n When I will give you back\n The love you have given me\n\n I'll pull you down and roughly love you\n And then I'll walk away\n Good - bye is the only word\n You will ever hear me say"}
