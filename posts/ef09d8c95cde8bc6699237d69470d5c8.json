{"subject": "Aphrodite Rising", "text": "In the audience, \nthe eyes of the astonished shells.\n\nMy body is water,\nvoluminous, untamed.\n\nMy body is light,\ncraved, dazzling, an enigma.\n\nMy body is sand, \nflowing upwards through the hourglass,\nfilling me, pushing me into lucid air, \nbathing me with transparence,\ngushing me into perfection,\nsculpting me free.\n\nI am becoming a goddess.\nI am rising."}
