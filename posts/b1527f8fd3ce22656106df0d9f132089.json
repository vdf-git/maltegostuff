{"subject": "At Morning", "text": "O Lord, my life was known to Thee\nEre Thou had\u2019st caused me yet to be,\nThy spirit ever dwells in me.\n\nCould I, cast down by Thee, have gained\nA standing place, or, if restrained\nBy Thee, go forth with feet unchained?\n\nHear me, Almighty, while I pray;\nMy thoughts are in Thy hand alway.\nBe to my helplessness a stay!\n\nO may this hour Thy favour yield,\nAnd may I tread life\u2019s battle-field\nEncompassed by Thy mercy\u2019s shield.\n\nWake me at dawn Thy name to bless,\nAnd in Thy sanctuary\u2019s recess\nTo praise and laud Thy holiness.\n\nTranslated by Alice Lucas"}
