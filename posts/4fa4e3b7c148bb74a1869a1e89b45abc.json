{"subject": "A Kafi", "text": "'Forests, trees, rocks and hills give me joy that my mind yearns for. \nEach tree in the village speaks to me, it tells me, pure! complete!' \n~Beethoven \n\nMy mind too, escapes in late spring \nto the branches of mango and palash trees \nand relaxes in contentment for a couple of hours \nin the young green and middle-aged reds of fields, \nafter all, all men are debtors to the earth. \n\nThe afternoon, lost in a daydream \nstares mutely in the distance, \nit's in the past with no effort at all, \nmy distracted thoughts spin in the wind \nand lose themselves in the call of doves \nacross deserted village rice-fields. \n\nThe evening, blushing with colours, \nsigns itself out on an exhilarating note, \nin the deep tune of a song. Do you know that I yearn for that song \njust like a parched chatak begs for water?"}
