{"subject": "In A Word", "text": "THUS to be chain'd for ever, can I bear?\nA very torment that, in truth, would be.\nThis very day my new resolve shall see.--\nI'll not go near the lately-worshipp'd Fair.\nYet what excuse, my heart, can I prepare\nIn such a case, for not consulting thee?\nBut courage! while our sorrows utter we\nIn tones where love, grief, gladness have a share.\nBut see! the minstrel's bidding to obey,\nIts melody pours forth the sounding lyre,\nYearning a sacrifice of love to bring.\nScarce wouldst thou think it--ready is the lay;\nWell, but what then? Methought in the first fire\nWe to her presence flew, that lay to sing."}
