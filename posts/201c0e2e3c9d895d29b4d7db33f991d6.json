{"subject": "The New Birth", "text": "a new life;--thoughts move not as they did \nWith slow uncertain steps across my mind, \nIn thronging haste fast pressing on they bid \nThe portals open to the viewless wind \nThat comes not save when in the dust is laid \nThe crown of pride that gilds each mortal brow, \nAnd from before man's vision melting fade \nThe heavens and earth;--their walls are falling now.-- \nFast crowding on, each thought asks utterance strong; \nStorm-lifted waves swift rushing to the shore, \nOn from the sea they send their shouts along, \nBack through the cave-worn rocks their thunders roar; \nAnd I a child of God by Christ made free \nStart from death's slumbers to Eternity."}
