{"subject": "February", "text": "NEWLY wedded, and happy quite,\nCareless alike of wind and weather, \nTwo wee birds, from a merry flight, \nSwing in the tree-top, sing together: \nLove to them, in the wintry hour, \nSummer and sunshine, bud and flower!\n\nSo, belov\u00ebd, when skies are sad,\nLove can render their somber golden;\nA thought of thee, and the day is glad\nAs a rose in the dewey dawn unfolden;\nAnd away, away, on passionate wings,\nMy heart like a bird at thy window sings!"}
