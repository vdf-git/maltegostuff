{"subject": "The Happening", "text": "Out of the mist she appeared in October, \nWhere the avenue crosses the street; \nA stunning figure in black attire, \nAttractive, vivacious, petite. \nI peered from my window at midnight. \nAll around me was dark and serene. \nOnly the glow of the street light \nEnhanced that incredible scene. \nOur eyes met and held for a moment \nAs surely as if it were day; \nThen having delivered her message \nShe turned - and walked slowly away. \nI knew she was aged and ailing \nAnd it seemed that it never could be, \nBut her spirit had traveled a great many miles \nFor a brief visitation with me!"}
