{"subject": "Calmly We Walk Through This April's Day", "text": "Calmly we walk through this April's day,\nMetropolitan poetry here and there,\nIn the park sit pauper and rentier,\nThe screaming children, the motor-car\nFugitive about us, running away,\nBetween the worker and the millionaire\nNumber provides all distances,\nIt is Nineteen Thirty-Seven now,\nMany great dears are taken away,\nWhat will become of you and me\n(This is the school in which we learn...)\nBesides the photo and the memory?\n(...that time is the fire in which we burn.)\n\n(This is the school in which we learn...)\nWhat is the self amid this blaze?\nWhat am I now that I was then\nWhich I shall suffer and act again,\nThe theodicy I wrote in my high school days\nRestored all life from infancy,\nThe children shouting are bright as they run\n(This is the school in which they learn . . .)\nRavished entirely in their passing play!\n(...that time is the fire in which they burn.)\n\nAvid its rush, that reeling blaze!\nWhere is my father and Eleanor?\nNot where are they now, dead seven years,\nBut what they were then?\n                                 No more? No more?\nFrom Nineteen-Fourteen to the present day,\nBert Spira and Rhoda consume, consume\nNot where they are now (where are they now?)\nBut what they were then, both beautiful;\n\nEach minute bursts in the burning room,\nThe great globe reels in the solar fire,\nSpinning the trivial and unique away.\n(How all things flash! How all things flare!)\nWhat am I now that I was then?\nMay memory restore again and again\nThe smallest color of the smallest day:\nTime is the school in which we learn,\nTime is the fire in which we burn."}
