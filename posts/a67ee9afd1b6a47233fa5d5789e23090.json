{"subject": "Sestina", "text": "I wandered o'er the vast green plains of youth, \nAnd searched for Pleasure. On a distant height\nFame's silhouette stood sharp against the skies.\nBeyond vast crowds that thronged a broad highway\nI caught the glimmer of a golden goal, \nWhile from a blooming bower smiled siren Love.\n\nStraight gazing in her eyes, I laughed at Love, \nWith all the haughty insolence of youth, \nAs past her bower I strode to seek my goal.\n'Now will I climb to glory's dizzy height, '\nI said, ' for there above the common way\nDoth pleasure dwell companioned by the skies.'\n\nBut when I reached that summit near the skies, \nSo far from man I seemed, so far from Love-\n'Not here, ' I cried, 'doth Pleasure find her way, '\nSeen from the distant borderland of youth.\nFame smiles upon us from her sun-kissed height, \nBut frowns in shadows when we reach the goal. \n\nThen were mine eyes fixed on that glittering goal, \nDear to all sense-sunk souls beneath the skies.\nGold tempts the artist from the lofty height, \nGold lures the maiden from the arms of Love, \nGold buys the fresh ingenuous heart of youth, \n'And gold, ' I said, 'will show me Pleasure's way.'\n\nBut ah! the soil and discord of that way, \nWhere savage hordes rushed headlong to the goal, \nDead to the best impulses of their youth, \nBlind to the azure beauty of the skies; \nDulled to the voice of conscience and of love, \nThey wandered far from Truth's eternal height.\n\nThen Truth spoke to me from that noble height, \nSaying: 'Thou didst pass Pleasure on the way, \nShe with the yearning eyes so full of Love, \nWhom thou disdained to seek for glory's goal.'\nTwo blending paths beneath God's arching skies\nLead straight to Pleasure. Ah, blind heart of youth, \nNot up fame's height, not toward the base god's goal, \nDoth Pleasure make her way, but 'neath calm skies\nWhere Duty walks with Love in endless youth."}
