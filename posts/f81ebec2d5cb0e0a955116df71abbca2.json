{"subject": "The Way Of It", "text": "This is the way of it, wide world over, \nOne is beloved, and one is the lover, \n  One gives and the other receives.\nOne lavishes all in a wild emotion, \nOne offers a smile for a life\u2019s devotion, \n  One hopes and the other believes, \nOne lies awake in the night to weep, \nAnd the other drifts off in a sweet sound sleep.\n\nOne soul is aflame with a godlike passion, \nOne plays with love in an idler\u2019s fashion, \n  One speaks and the other hears.\nOne sobs, \u2018I love you, \u2019 and wet eyes to show it, \nAnd one laughs lightly, and says, \u2018I know it, \u2019\n  With smiles for the other\u2019s tears.\nOne lives for the other and nothing beside, \nAnd the other remembers the world is wide.\n\nThis is the way of it, sad earth over, \nThe heart that breaks is the heart of the lover, \n  And the other learns to forget.\n\u2018For what is the use in endless sorrow? \nThough the sun goes down, it will rise tomorrow; \n  And life is not over yet.\u2019\nOh! I know this truth, if I know no other, \nThat passionate Love is Pain\u2019s own mother."}
