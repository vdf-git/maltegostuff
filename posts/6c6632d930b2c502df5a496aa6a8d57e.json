{"subject": "Eleventh Hour", "text": "The bloom was off the economic recovery.\n\"I just want to know one thing,\" she said.\nWhat was that one thing? He'll never know,\nBecause at just that moment he heard the sound\nOf broken glass in the bathroom, and when he got there,\nIt was dark. His hand went to the wall\nBut the switch wasn't where it was supposed to be\nWhich felt like d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. And then she was gone.\nAnd now he knew how it felt to stand\nOn the local platform as the express whizzes by\nWith people chatting in a dialect \nOf English he couldn't understand, because his English\nWas current as of 1968 and no one speaks that way except\nIn certain books. So the hours spent in vain\nWere minutes blown up into comic-book balloons full\nOf Keats's odes. \"Goodbye, kid.\" Tears streamed down\nThe boy's face. It was a great feeling,\nLike the feeling you get when you throw things away\nAfter a funeral: clean and empty in the morning dark.\nThere was no time for locker-room oratory.\nThey knew they were facing a do-or-die situation,\nWith their backs to the wall, and no tomorrow."}
