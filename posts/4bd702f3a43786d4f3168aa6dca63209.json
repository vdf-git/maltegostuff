{"subject": "The House With A Thousand Novels", "text": "This is a house, L-shaped, \nseven-hands high; soil-veranda\u2014  \nwith twenty-one novels in it.   \nEvery evening, five daughters beyond the banks, \nwho rested like bees in other houses, \nwith higher lower or equal soil-verandas \nand more or lesser novels,  \nlift a night-black iron cauldron \nso that it squats on the hearth. \nThis is a house, with twenty-one novels, \nforever spanning  \nin episodic form, like long yarns. \nIn the room facing the east, where the eldest son lived \nan almirah stood, with termites battling against it\u2014 \nevery night, along with the odious I'll-take-you-away-song \nof the bespectacled inauspicious barn-owl; \nproud, filled to the neck, with a thousand books. \nMany of them were novels. \nPopular, unpopular, pulp \nerotic (hidden between old \"important\" newspaper cuttings) .  \nThis is a house with eight doors, \nseventeen windows, no ventilators. \nIn summers heavy with sweat and skin \nsnakes creep in for coconut-water-cold soil,  \ncoated cool with greenish cow-dung \nthe epidermis of the seven-hand high veranda. \nEveryday someone comes in\u2014  \nleaving rippling traces forever \nlike generational earthquakes: \n  A wailing woman leaves a story of oppression, licensedrape, barrenness, adultery; \n\nA married daughter, beyond the banks, comes back to \ndisrupt diaries; \n  A worker runs away, digging up hidden gold jewellery \nfrom one of these story-ridden rooms.\nThis is a house, with  \na thousand serialised novels \nfloating in the heavy air. \nSomeone shrieks everyday. \nSomeone reads the caws of the crow and expects guests.  \nPicks up a mosquito from the milk and prays that no one dies. \nLights a mustard oil lamp in the household's prayer-room singing \npleading songs. \nAnd children carry love letters for peanuts from here, from there,  \nleaving traces of story   \nto be ruminated forever:  \nwith meals. \nAt night, around winter-fires, \nthe chewing and grinding of betel-nuts, \nwhile lifting the iron cauldron. \nThis is a house with a thousand novels \n(or more) . \nEvery window or a room that mourns for a vent \ntreasures a story in it, which   \nno worker can run away with; \nmore precious than gold \nburied deep enough, deeper than  \na spring, a well  \nso that it lives forever and grows \nlike tears, hair and serialised novels in journals; \ninadequate to live anymore \nin a wooden almirah eroded by termites."}
