{"subject": "The Rider", "text": "Welcome Rider\nHighwayman\nragged with hunger and cold\nfrightened by winds\nCome, retreat to my tent\nRest awhile, lay down your sword\nThis fire that warms the soul is for you\nThis dew-washed robe is for you\nand the wine stored in the tent,\nthe mare poised to charge,\nthe lance made of lightning, are all for you\nand yours is the pillow\nbut don't let sleep swallow you up\nfor those caravans\nfilling the horizon come for you\nthey come for you, for you, for you\nthey come for you.\n\nTranslated by: Lena jayyusi and Cbristopber Middleton"}
