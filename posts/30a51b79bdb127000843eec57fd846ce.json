{"subject": "Alone Again, I Cry", "text": "My tears fall from heaven\nLike rain from the sky, \nI sit here all alone\nI rock myself and cry.\n\nI reach out in the night\nAnd wonder where you are, \nThe tear rolls down my face\nAs I cry beneath our star.\n\nTonight you sleep alone\nMiles away from me, \nI pray to you with all my heart \nFor you to hear my plea.\n\nPlease come to me tonight\nMake love to me in sleep, \nHold me close dont let me go\nI pray to you my love to keep.\n\nI stand beneath the starry sky\nAnd feel the moonlight on my face.\nI wrap my arms around myself\nAnd dream of your embrace.\n\nWould it be if life could change\nYou'd be here now with me? \nI'd no longer be an empty ship\nDrifting alone, lost at sea. \n\nIf now I closed my eyes \nWould you come to me? \nWould you press your lips to mine\nAnd kiss me tenderly? \n\nEvery night I lie in wait for you\nTo come and hold me tight, \nTo feel you slipping into me\nMaking love thru out the night.\n\nYet tonight's like all the others\nI sit alone and cry my pain, \nMy tears wash down my face\nLike a storm cloud full of rain.\n\nI miss you more than you know\nAnd need you just as much, \nYou can take away my sorrow\nWith just a simple touch.\n\nPlace your lips to my brow\nAnd kiss me tenderly, \nTell me there is no other\nYou've loved like you do me.\n\nJust wrap your arms around me \nAnd pull me close to you, \nThen love me like no other\nAnd prove your love is true."}
