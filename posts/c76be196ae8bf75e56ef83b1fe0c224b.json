{"subject": "Funnel", "text": "The family story tells, and it was told true, \nof my great-grandfather who begat eight \ngenius children and bought twelve almost-new \ngrand pianos. He left a considerable estate \nwhen he died. The children honored their \nseparate arts; two became moderately famous, \nthree married and fattened their delicate share \nof wealth and brilliance. The sixth one was \na concert pianist. She had a notable career \nand wore cropped hair and walked like a man, \nor so I heard when prying a childhood car \ninto the hushed talk of the straight Maine clan. \nOne died a pinafore child, she stays her five \nyears forever. And here is one that wrote- \nI sort his odd books and wonder his once alive \nwords and scratch out my short marginal notes \nand finger my accounts. \nback from that great-grandfather I have come \nto tidy a country graveyard for his sake, \nto chat with the custodian under a yearly sun \nand touch a ghost sound where it lies awake. \nI like best to think of that Bunyan man \nslapping his thighs and trading the yankee sale \nfor one dozen grand pianos. it fit his plan \nof culture to do it big. On this same scale \nhe built seven arking houses and they still stand. \nOne, five stories up, straight up like a square \nbox, still dominates its coastal edge of land. \nIt is rented cheap in the summer musted air \nto sneaker-footed families who pad through \nits rooms and sometimes finger the yellow keys \nof an old piano that wheezes bells of mildew. \nLike a shoe factory amid the spruce trees \nit squats; flat roof and rows of windows spying \nthrough the mist. Where those eight children danced \ntheir starfished summers, the thirty-six pines sighing, \nthat bearded man walked giant steps and chanced \nhis gifts in numbers. \nBack from that great-grandfather I have come \nto puzzle a bending gravestone for his sake, \nto question this diminishing and feed a minimum \nof children their careful slice of suburban cake."}
