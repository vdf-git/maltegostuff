{"subject": "Nearing Christmas", "text": "THE season of the rose and peace is past:\nIt could not last.\nThere's heartbreak in the hills and stormy sighs\nOf sorrow in the rain-lashed plains and skies,\nWhile Earth regards, aghast,\nThe last red leaf that flies.\nThe world is cringing in the darkness where\nWar left his lair,\nAnd everything takes on a lupine look,\nBaring gaunt teeth at every peaceful nook,\nAnd shaking torrent hair\nAt every little brook.\nCancers of ulcerous flame his eyes, and \u2014 hark!\nThere in the dark\nThe ponderous stir of metal, iron feet;\nAnd with it, heard around the world, the beat\nOf Battle; sounds that mark\nHis heart's advance, retreat.\nWith shrapnel pipes he goes his monstrous ways; \nAnd, screeching, plays \nThe hell-born music Havoc dances to; \nAnd, following with his skeleton-headed crew \nOf ravening Nights and Days, \nHorror invades the blue.\nAgainst the Heaven he lifts a mailed fist\nAnd writes a list\nOf beautiful cities on the ghastly sky:\nAnd underneath them, with no reason why,\nIn blood and tears and mist,\nThe postscript, 'These must die!'\nChange is the portion and chief heritage\nOf every Age.\nThe spirit of God still waits its time.\u2014 And War \nMay blur His message for a while, and mar\nThe writing on His page,\nTo this our sorrowful star.\nBut there above the conflict, orbed in rays,\nIs drawn the face\nOf Peace; at last who comes into her own;\nPeace, from whose tomb the world shall roll the stone,\nAnd give her highest place\nIn the human heart alone."}
