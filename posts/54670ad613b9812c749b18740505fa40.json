{"subject": "The Cliff", "text": "By a cliff a golden cloud once lingered; \nOn his breast it slept, but, rising early, \nOff it gently rushed across the pearly \nBlue of sky, a tiny thing and winged. \n\nStill, a trace it left upon the stony \nGiant's heart, and plunged in thought and weeping \nSlow and tortured tears, he stands there, keeping \nVigil o'er the gloomy waste and lonely."}
