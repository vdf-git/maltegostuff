{"subject": "The Fiddler", "text": "There's a fiddler in the street,\nAnd the children all are dancing:\nTwo dozen lightsome feet\nSpringing and prancing.\n\nPleasure he gives to you,\nDance then, and spare not!\nFor the poor fiddler's due,\nKnow not and care not.\n\nWhile you are prancing,\nLet the fiddler play.\nWhen you're tired of dancing\nHe may go away."}
