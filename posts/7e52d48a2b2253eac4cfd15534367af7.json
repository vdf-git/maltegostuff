{"subject": "The Unseen Playmate", "text": "When children are playing alone on the green, \nIn comes the playmate that never was seen. \nWhen children are happy and lonely and good, \nThe Friend of the Children comes out of the wood. \n\nNobody heard him, and nobody saw, \nHis is a picture you never could draw, \nBut he's sure to be present, abroad or at home, \nWhen children are happy and playing alone. \n\nHe lies in the laurels, he runs on the grass, \nHe sings when you tinkle the musical glass; \nWhene'er you are happy and cannot tell why, \nThe Friend of the Children is sure to be by! \n\nHe loves to be little, he hates to be big, \n'T is he that inhabits the caves that you dig; \n'T is he when you play with your soldiers of tin \nThat sides with the Frenchmen and never can win. \n\n'T is he, when at night you go off to your bed, \nBids you go to sleep and not trouble your head; \nFor wherever they're lying, in cupboard or shelf, \n'T is he will take care of your playthings himself!"}
