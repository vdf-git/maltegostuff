{"subject": "The Lost Heart", "text": "One golden summer day,\nAlong the forest-way,\nYoung Colin passed with blithesome steps alert.\n\nHis locks with careless grace\nRimmed round his handsome face\nAnd drifted outward on the airy surge.\n\nSo blithe of heart was he,\nHe hummed a melody,\nAnd all the birds were hushed to hear him sing.\n\nAcross his shoulders flung\nHis bow and baldric hung:\nSo, in true huntsman's guise, he threads the wood.\n\nThe sun mounts up the sky,\nThe air moves sluggishly,\nAnd reeks with summer heat in every pore.\n\nHis limbs begin to tire,\nSlumbers his youthful fire;\nHe sinks upon a violet-bed to rest.\n\nThe soft winds go and come\nWith low and drowsy hum,\nAnd ope for him the ivory gate of dreams.\n\nBeneath the forest-shade\nThere trips a woodland maid,\nAnd marks with startled eye the sleeping youth.\n\nAt first she thought to fly,\nThen, timid, drawing nigh,\nShe gazed in wonder on his fair young face.\n\nWhen swiftly stooping down\nUpon his locks so brown\nShe lightly pressed her lips, and blushing fled.\n\nWhen Colin woke from sleep, \nFrom slumbers calm and deep,\nHe felt- he knew not how- his heart had flown.\n\nAnd so, with anxious care,\nHe wandered here and there,\nBut could not find his lost heart anywhere. \n\nThen he, with air distraught, \nAnd brow of anxious thought,\nWent out into the world beyond the wood.\n\nOf each that passed him by,\nHe queried anxiously,\n'I prithee, hast thou seen a heart astray?'\n\nSome stared and hurried on,\nWhile others said in scorn.\nYour heart has gone in search of your lost wits'\n\nThe day is wearing fast,\nYoung Colin comes at last\nTo where a cottage stood embowered in trees.\n\nHe looks within, and there\nHe sees a maiden fair,\nWho sings low songs the while she plies her wheel.\n\n'I prithee, maiden bright,'-\nShe turns as quick as light,\nAnd straight a warm flush crimsons all her face.\n\nShe, much abashed, looks down,\nFor on his locks so brown\nShe seems to see the marks her lips have made.\n\nWhereby she stands confest;\nWhat need to tell the rest?\nHe said, 'I think, fair maid, you have my heart.\n\n'Nay, do not give it back,\nI shall not feel the lack,\nIf thou wilt give to me thine own therefor.'"}
