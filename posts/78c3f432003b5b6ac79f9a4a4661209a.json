{"subject": "Lily", "text": "Carefree spirit of a lily in its unique design. \nSoftly whispers in the winds a devotion of a yearning heart.  The enchanting beauty of floral design.  \nSwirls of fabulous color.  \nFragile and elegant.  \nWhispers expressions of splendors beyond compare.  \nA demure glance of eternity.  \nA spiritual dimension unknown to natural man."}
