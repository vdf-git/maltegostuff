{"subject": "The Love Sonnets Of Proteus.  Part Ii: To Juliet: Xxiv", "text": "THE SAME CONTINUED\nGive me thy soul, Juliet, give me thy soul!\nI am a bitter sea, which drinketh in\nThe sweetness of all waters, and so thine.\nThou, like a river, pure and swift and full\nAnd freighted with the wealth of many lands,\nWith hopes, and fears, and death and life, dost roll\nAgainst the troubled ocean of my sin.\nThou doubtest not, though on these desert sands\nThe billows surge against thee black with brine,\nUnwearied. For thy love is fixed and even\nAnd bears thee onward, and thy faith is whole.\nThough thou thyself shouldst sin, yet surely Heaven\nHath held thee guiltless and thou art forgiven."}
