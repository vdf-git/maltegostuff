{"subject": "Mine And Thine", "text": "Two words about the world we see, \nAnd nought but Mine and Thine they be. \nAh! might we drive them forth and wide \nWith us should rest and peace abide; \nAll free, nought owned of goods and gear, \nBy men and women though it were \nCommon to all all wheat and wine \nOver the seas and up the Rhine. \nNo manslayer then the wide world o'er \nWhen Mine and Thine are known no more. \n\nYea, God, well counselled for our health, \nGave all this fleeting earthly wealth \nA common heritage to all, \nThat men might feed them therewithal, \nAnd clothe their limbs and shoe their feet \nAnd live a simple life and sweet. \nBut now so rageth greediness \nThat each desireth nothing less \nThan all the world, and all his own, \nAnd all for him and him alone."}
