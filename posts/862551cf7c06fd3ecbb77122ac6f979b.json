{"subject": "Sonnet: Morning", "text": "Light as the breeze that hails the infant morn\nThe Milkmaid trips, as o'er her arm she slings\nHer cleanly pail, some favorite lay she sings\nAs sweetly wild, and cheerful, as the horn.\nO happy girl! may never faithless love,\nOr fancied splendor, lead thy steps astray;\nNo cares becloud the sunshine of thy day,\nNor want e'er urge thee from thy cot to rove.\nWhat tho' thy station dooms thee to be poor,\nAnd by the hard-earn'd morsel thou art fed;\nYet sweet content bedecks thy lowly bed,\nAnd health and peace sit smiling at thy door:\nOf these possess'd-thou hast a gracious meed,\nWhich Heaven's high wisdom gives, to make thee rich indeed!"}
