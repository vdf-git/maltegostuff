{"subject": "Sonnet Xvii: Why Should I Sing In Verse", "text": "Why should I sing in verse, why should I frame \nThese sad neglected notes for her dear sake? \nWhy should I offer up onto her name \nThe sweetest sacrifice my youth can make? \nWhy should I strive to make her live for ever, \nThat never deigns to give me joy to live? \nWhy should m'afflicted Muse so much endeavor, \nSuch honor unto cruelty to give? \nIf her defects have purchas'd her this fame, \nWhat should her virtues do, her smiles, her love? \nIf this her worst, how should her best enflame? \nWhat passions would her milder favors move? \nFavors (I think) would sense quite overcome, \nAnd that makes happy Lovers ever dumb."}
