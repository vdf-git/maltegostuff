{"subject": "Menopause", "text": "So far,\nall over the world,\nwomen have survived it.\nPerhaps it was that our grandmothers were stoic\nor, that back then, they weren't entitled to complain,\nstill they reached old age\nwilting bodies\nbut strong souls.\nNow, instead,\ndissertations are written on the subject.\nAs early as thirty agony sets in,\nForetelling the catastrophe.\n\nA body is much more than the sum of its hormones.\nMenopausal or not\na woman remains a woman,\nbeyond the production of secretions or eggs.\nTo miss a period does not imply the loss of syntax\nor coherence;\nit shouldn't lead to hiding\nas a snail in a shell,\nnor provoke endless brooding.\nIf  depression sets in\nit won't be a new occurrence,\neach menstrual cycle has come to us with tears\nand its load of irrational anger.\nThere is no reason, then,\nto feel devalued:\nGet rid of  tampons\nand sanitary napkins!\nUse them to light a bonfire in your garden!\nBe naked\nDance the ritual of aging\nAnd survive\nLike so many\nBefore you."}
