{"subject": "To A Crow", "text": "BOLD, amiable, ebon outlaw, grave and wise!\nFor many a good green year hast thou withstood\u2014\nBy dangerous, planted field and haunted wood\u2014\nAll the devices of thine enemies,\nGleaning thy grudg\u00ebd bread with watchful eyes \nAnd self-relying soul. Come ill or good,\nBlithe days thou see\u2019st, thou feathered Robin Hood!\nThou mak\u2019st a jest of farm-land boundaries.\nTake all thou may\u2019st, and never count it crime\nTo rob the greatest robber of the earth, \nWeak-visioned, dull, self-lauding man, whose worth\nIs in his own esteem. Bide thou thy time;\nThou know\u2019st far more of Nature\u2019s lore than he,\nAnd her wide lap shall still provide for thee."}
