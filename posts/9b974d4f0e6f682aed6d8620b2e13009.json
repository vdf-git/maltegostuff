{"subject": "Soldiers To Pacifists", "text": "NOT ours to clamor shame on you,\nNor fling a bitter blame on you,\nNor brand a cruel name on you,\nThat evil name of treason,\nYou who have heard the ivory flutes,\nWho float white banners, brave recruits\nOf Peace, seeking to pluck her fruits\nIn bud and blossom season.\nA sterner bugle calls to us;\nMore direful duty falls to us;\nGod grants no garden-walls to us\nTill the scarred waste be delivered\nFrom dragon passions that destroy\nAll sanctitudes of faith and joy;\nWe, too, are on divine employ;\nBy sword shall sword be shivered.\nCherish your bud, star-eyed of bloom,\nDawn-flower of hope, belied of gloom,\nWhile, surges of the tide of doom,\nThe gathering nations thunder\nAgainst a red, colossal throne;\nCherish it, that the seed be sown\nAt last even where that monstrous stone\nCrushes life's roots asunder.\nFollow your flutes the fairy way;\nWing-sandaled, climb the airy way,\nThe wonderful, unwary way,\nToo lovely for derision;\nWhile we, your comrades at the goal,\nStep to the drum-beat and unroll\nThe flag of Freedom, every soul\nObedient to its vision."}
