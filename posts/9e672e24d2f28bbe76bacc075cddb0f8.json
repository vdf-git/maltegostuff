{"subject": "The Good Shepherd (From The Spanish Of Lope De Vega)", "text": "Shepherd! who with thine amorous sylvan songs \nHast broken the slumber that encompassed me,\nWho mad'st thy crook from the accursed tree,\nOn which thy powerful arms were stretched so long!\nLead me to mercy's ever-flowing fountains;\nFor thou my shepherd, guard, and guide shalt be ;\nI will obey thy voice, and wait to see \nThy feet all beautiful upon the mountains. \nHear, Shepherd! thou who for thy flock art dying,\nOh, wash away these scarlet sins, for thou\nRejoicest at the contrite sinner's vow.\nOh, wait! to thee my weary soul is crying,\nWait for me! Yet why ask it, when I see,\nWith feet nailed to the cross, thou'rt waiting still for me?"}
