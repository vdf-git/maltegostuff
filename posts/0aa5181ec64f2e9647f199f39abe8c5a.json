{"subject": "Madrigal Iv", "text": "Once for her face, I saw my Faire\nDid of her haires a shadow make:\nOr rather wandring hearts to take,\nShe stented had those nets of gold,\nSure by this meanes all men t'ensnare,\nShe toss'd the streamers with her breath,\nAnd seem'd to boast a world with death:\nBut when I did the sleight behold,\nI to the shadow did repaire,\nTo flie the burning of thine eyes;\nO happie he, by such a sleight that dies."}
