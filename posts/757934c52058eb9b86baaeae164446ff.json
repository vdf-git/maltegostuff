{"subject": "Night", "text": "After the fret and failure of this day,\nAnd weariness of thought, O Mother Night,\nCome with soft kiss to soothe our care away\nAnd all our little tumults set to right;\nMost pitiful of all death\u2019s kindred fair,\nRiding above us through the curtained air\nOn thy dusk car, thou scatterest to the earth\nSweet dreams and drowsy charms of tender might\nAnd lovers\u2019 dear delight before to-morrow\u2019s birth.\nThus art thou wont thy quiet lands to leave\nAnd pillared courts beyond the Milky Way,\nWherein thou tarriest all our solar day\nWhile unsubstantial dreams before thee weave\nA foamy dance, and fluttering fancies play\nAbout thy palace in the silver ray\nOf some far, moony globe. But when the hour,\nThe long-expected comes, the ivory gates\nOpen on noiseless hinge before thy bower\nUnbidden, and the jewelled chariot waits\nWith magic steeds. Thou from the fronting rim\nBending to urge them, whilst thy sea-dark hair\nFalls in ambrosial ripples o\u2019er each limb,\nWith beautiful pale arms, untrammelled, bare\nFor horsemanship, to those twin chargers fleet\nDost give full rein across the fires that glow\nIn the wide floor of heaven, from off their feet\nScattering the powdery star-dust as they go.\nCome swiftly down the sky, O Lady Night,\nFall through the shadow-country, O most kind,\nShake out thy strands of gentle dreams and light\nFor chains, wherewith thou still art used to bind\nWith tenderest love of careful leeches\u2019 art\nThe bruised and weary heart\nIn slumber blind."}
