{"subject": "Presences", "text": "I HAVE seen women weave\nTheir delicate way through the gloaming,\nI have seen their wraiths go roaming\nIn the dim and deepening eve.\n\nTheir voices in desolate eves\nDied long ago in the doorways,\nTheir memories sleep in the porches\nFaded along with the leaves.\n\nAs a poor man for a bed\nHis leaves of gold will heap,\nSoul! lay them under thy head,\nThy memories, and sleep.\n\nAnd take them unto thy breast,\nWarmly under them rest,\nSo that their perfumes that stain\nThy hands in thy heart may remain.\n\ntranslated by Jethro Bithell"}
