{"subject": "Love", "text": "Love is the sunlight of the soul,\nThat, shining on the silken-tress\u00e8d head\nOf her we love, around it seems to shed\n   A golden angel-aureole. \n\n   And all her ways seem sweeter ways\nThan those of other women in that light:\nShe has no portion with the pallid night,\n   But is a part of all fair days. \n\n   Joy goes where she goes, and good dreams\u2014\nHer smile is tender as an old romance\nOf Love that dies not, and her soft eye\u2019s glance\n   Like sunshine set to music seems. \n\n   Queen of our fate is she, but crowned\nWith purple hearts-ease for her womanhood.\nThere is no place so poor where she has stood\n   But evermore is holy ground. \n\n   An angel from the heaven above\nWould not be fair to us as she is fair:\nShe holds us in a mesh of silken hair,\n   This one sweet woman whom we love. \n\n   We pray thee, Love, our souls to steep\nIn dreams wherein thy myrtle flowereth;\nSo when the rose leaves shiver, feeling Death\n   Pass by, we may remain asleep: \n\n   Asleep, with poppies in our hands,\nFrom all the world and all its cares apart\u2014\nCheek close to cheek, heart beating against heart,\n   While through Life\u2019s sandglass run the sands"}
