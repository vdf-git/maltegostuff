{"subject": "Sohrab And Rustum", "text": "And the first grey of morning fill'd the east,\nAnd the fog rose out of the Oxus stream.\nBut all the Tartar camp along the stream\nWas hush'd, and still the men were plunged in sleep;\nSohrab alone, he slept not; all night long\nHe had lain wakeful, tossing on his bed;\nBut when the grey dawn stole into his tent,\nHe rose, and clad himself, and girt his sword,\nAnd took his horseman's cloak, and left his tent,\nAnd went abroad into the cold wet fog,\nThrough the dim camp to Peran-Wisa's tent. \n\nThrough the black Tartar tents he pass'd, which stood\nClustering like bee-hives on the low flat strand\nOf Oxus, where the summer-floods o'erflow\nWhen the sun melts the snows in high Pamere;\nThrough the black tents he pass'd, o'er that low strand,\nAnd to a hillock came, a little back\nFrom the stream's brink--the spot where first a boat,\nCrossing the stream in summer, scrapes the land.\nThe men of former times had crown'd the top\nWith a clay fort; but that was fall'n, and now\nThe Tartars built there Peran-Wisa's tent,\nA dome of laths, and o'er it felts were spread.\nAnd Sohrab came there, and went in, and stood\nUpon the thick piled carpets in the tent,\nAnd found the old man sleeping on his bed\nOf rugs and felts, and near him lay his arms.\nAnd Peran-Wisa heard him, though the step\nWas dull'd; for he slept light, an old man's sleep;\nAnd he rose quickly on one arm, and said:-- \n\n\"Who art thou? for it is not yet clear dawn.\nSpeak! is there news, or any night alarm?\" \n\nBut Sohrab came to the bedside, and said:--\n\"Thou know'st me, Peran-Wisa! it is I.\nThe sun is not yet risen, and the foe\nSleep; but I sleep not; all night long I lie\nTossing and wakeful, and I come to thee.\nFor so did King Afrasiab bid me seek\nThy counsel and to heed thee as thy son,\nIn Samarcand, before the army march'd;\nAnd I will tell thee what my heart desires.\nThou know'st if, since from Ader-baijan first\nI came among the Tartars and bore arms,\nI have still served Afrasiab well, and shown,\nAt my boy's years, the courage of a man.\nThis too thou know'st, that while I still bear on\nThe conquering Tartar ensigns through the world,\nAnd beat the Persians back on every field,\nI seek one man, one man, and one alone--\nRustum, my father; who I hoped should greet, \nShould one day greet, upon some well fought field,\nHis not unworthy, not inglorious son.\nSo I long hoped, but him I never find.\nCome then, hear now, and grant me what I ask.\nLet the two armies rest to-day; but I\nWill challenge forth the bravest Persian lords\nTo meet me, man to man; if I prevail,\nRustum will surely hear it; if I fall--\nOld man, the dead need no one, claim no kin.\nDim is the rumour of a common fight,\nWhere host meets host, and many names are sunk;\nBut of a single combat fame speaks clear.\" \n\nHe spoke; and Peran-Wisa took the hand\nOf the young man in his, and sigh'd, and said:-- \n\nO Sohrab, an unquiet heart is thine!\nCanst thou not rest among the Tartar chiefs,\nAnd share the battle's common chance with us\nWho love thee, but must press for ever first,\nIn single fight incurring single risk,\nTo find a father thou hast never seen?\nThat were far best, my son, to stay with us\nUnmurmuring; in our tents, while it is war,\nAnd when 'tis truce, then in Afrasiab's towns.\nBut, if this one desire indeed rules all,\nTo seek out Rustum--seek him not through fight!\nSeek him in peace, and carry to his arms,\nO Sohrab, carry an unwounded son!\nBut far hence seek him, for he is not here.\nFor now it is not as when I was young,\nWhen Rustum was in front of every fray;\nBut now he keeps apart, and sits at home,\nIn Seistan, with Zal, his father old.\nWhether that his own mighty strength at last\nFeels the abhorr'd approaches of old age,\nOr in some quarrel with the Persian King.\nThere go!--Thou wilt not? Yet my heart forebodes\nDanger or death awaits thee on this field.\nFain would I know thee safe and well, though lost\nTo us; fain therefore send thee hence, in peace\nTo seek thy father, not seek single fights\nIn vain;--but who can keep the lion's cub\nFrom ravening, and who govern Rustum's son?\nGo, I will grant thee what thy heart desires.\" \n\nSo said he, and dropp'd Sohrab's hand, and left\nHis bed, and the warm rugs whereon he lay;\nAnd o'er his chilly limbs his woollen coat\nHe pass'd, and tied his sandals on his feet,\nAnd threw a white cloak round him, and he took\nIn his right hand a ruler's staff, no sword;\nAnd on his head he set his sheep-skin cap,\nBlack, glossy, curl'd, the fleece of Kara-Kul;\nAnd raised the curtain of his tent, and call'd\nHis herald to his side, and went abroad. \n\nThe sun by this had risen, and clear'd the fog\nFrom the broad Oxus and the glittering sands.\nAnd from their tents the Tartar horsemen filed\nInto the open plain; so Haman bade--\nHaman, who next to Peran-Wisa ruled\nThe host, and still was in his lusty prime.\nFrom their black tents, long files of horse, they stream'd;\nAs when some grey November morn the files,\nIn marching order spread, of long-neck'd cranes\nStream over Casbin and the southern slopes\nOf Elburz, from the Aralian estuaries,\nOr some frore Caspian reed-bed, southward bound\nFor the warm Persian sea-board--so they stream'd.\nThe Tartars of the Oxus, the King's guard,\nFirst, with black sheep-skin caps and with long spears;\nLarge men, large steeds; who from Bokhara come\nAnd Khiva, and ferment the milk of mares.\nNext, the more temperate Toorkmuns of the south,\nThe Tukas, and the lances of Salore,\nAnd those from Attruck and the Caspian sands;\nLight men and on light steeds, who only drink\nThe acrid milk of camels, and their wells.\nAnd then a swarm of wandering horse, who came\nFrom far, and a more doubtful service own'd;\nThe Tartars of Ferghana, from the banks\nOf the Jaxartes, men with scanty beards\nAnd close-set skull-caps; and those wilder hordes\nWho roam o'er Kipchak and the northern waste,\nKalmucks and unkempt Kuzzaks, tribes who stray\nNearest the Pole, and wandering Kirghizzes,\nWho come on shaggy ponies from Pamere;\nThese all filed out from camp into the plain.\nAnd on the other side the Persians form'd;--\nFirst a light cloud of horse, Tartars they seem'd,\nThe Ilyats of Khorassan, and behind,\nThe royal troops of Persia, horse and foot,\nMarshall'd battalions bright in burnish'd steel.\nBut Peran-Wisa with his herald came,\nThreading the Tartar squadrons to the front,\nAnd with his staff kept back the foremost ranks.\nAnd when Ferood, who led the Persians, saw\nThat Peran-Wisa kept the Tartars back,\nHe took his spear, and to the front he came,\nAnd check'd his ranks, and fix'd them where they stood.\nAnd the old Tartar came upon the sand\nBetwixt the silent hosts, and spake, and said:-- \n\n\"Ferood, and ye, Persians and Tartars, hear!\nLet there be truce between the hosts to-day.\nBut choose a champion from the Persian lords\nTo fight our champion Sohrab, man to man.\" \n\nAs, in the country, on a morn in June,\nWhen the dew glistens on the pearled ears,\nA shiver runs through the deep corn for joy--\nSo, when they heard what Peran-Wisa said,\nA thrill through all the Tartar squadrons ran\nOf pride and hope for Sohrab, whom they loved. \n\nBut as a troop of pedlars, from Cabool,\nCross underneath the Indian Caucasus,\nThat vast sky-neighbouring mountain of milk snow;\nCrossing so high, that, as they mount, they pass\nLong flocks of travelling birds dead on the snow,\nChoked by the air, and scarce can they themselves\nSlake their parch'd throats with sugar'd mulberries--\nIn single file they move, and stop their breath,\nFor fear they should dislodge the o'er hanging snows--\nSo the pale Persians held their breath with fear. \n\nAnd to Ferood his brother chiefs came up\nTo counsel; Gudurz and Zoarrah came\nAnd Feraburz, who ruled the Persian host\nSecond, and was the uncle of the King\nThese came and counsell'd, and then Gudurz said:-- \n\n\"Ferood, shame bids us take their challenge up,\nYet champion have we none to match this youth.\nHe has the wild stag's foot, the lion's heart.\nBut Rustum came last night; aloof he sits\nAnd sullen, and has pitch'd his tents apart.\nHim will I seek, and carry to his ear\nThe Tartar challenge, and this young man's name.\nHaply he will forget his wrath, and fight.\nStand forth the while, and take their challenge up.\" \n\nSo spake he; and Ferood stood forth and cried.--\n\"Old man, be it agreed as thou hast said!\nLet Sohrab arm, and we will find a man.\" \n\nHe spake: and Peran-Wisa turn'd, and strode\nBack through the opening squadrons to his tent.\nBut through the anxious Persians Gudurz ran,\nAnd cross'd the camp which lay behind, and reach'd,\nOut on the sands beyond it, Rustum's tents.\nOf scarlet cloth they were, and glittering gay\nJust pitch'd; the high pavilion in the midst\nWas Rustum's, and his men lay camp'd around.\nAnd Gudurz enter'd Rustum's tent, and found\nRustum; his morning meal was done, but still\nThe table stood before him, charged with food--\nA side of roasted sheep, and cakes of bread,\nAnd dark green melons; and there Rustum sate\nListless, and held a falcon on his wrist,\nAnd play'd with it; but Gudurz came and stood\nBefore him; and he look'd, and saw him stand,\nAnd with a cry sprang up and dropp'd the bird,\nAnd greeted Gudurz with both hands, and said:-- \n\n\"Welcome! these eyes could see no better sight.\nWhat news? but sit down first, and eat and drink.\" \n\nBut Gudurz stood in the tent-door, and said:--\n\"Not now! a time will come to eat and drink,\nBut not to-day; to-day has other needs.\nThe armies are drawn out, and stand at gaze;\nFor from the Tartars is a challenge brought\nTo pick a champion from the Persian lords\nTo fight their champion--and thou know'st his name--\nSohrab men call him, but his birth is kid.\nO Rustum, like thy might is this young man's!\nHe has the wild stag's foot, the lion's heart;\nAnd he is young, and Iran's chiefs are old,\nOr else too weak; and all eyes turn to thee.\nCome down and help us, Rustum, or we lose!'' \n\nHe spoke; but Rustum answer'd with a smile:--\n\"Go to! if Iran's chiefs are old, then I\nAm older; if the young are weak, the King\nErrs strangely; for the King, for Kai Khosroo,\nHimself is young, and honours younger men,\nAnd lets the aged moulder to their graves.\nRustum he loves no more, but loves the young--\nThe young may rise at Sohrab's vaunts, not I.\nFor what care I, though all speak Sohrab's fame?\nFor would that I myself had such a son,\nAnd not that one slight helpless girl I have--\nA son so famed, so brave, to send to war,\nAnd I to tarry with the snow-hair'd Zal,\nMy father, whom the robber Afghans vex,\nAnd clip his borders short, and drive his herds,\nAnd he has none to guard his weak old age.\nThere would I go, and hang my armour up,\nAnd with my great name fence that weak old man,\nAnd spend the goodly treasures I have got,\nAnd rest my age, and hear of Sohrab's fame,\nAnd leave to death the hosts of thankless kings,\nAnd with these slaughterous hands draw sword no more.'' \n\nHe spoke, and smiled; and Gudurz made reply:---\n\"What then, O Rustum, will men say to this,\nWhen Sohrab dares our bravest forth, and seeks\nThee most of all, and thou, whom most he seeks,\nHidest thy face? Take heed lest men should say:\nLike some old miser, Rustum hoards his fame,\nAnd shuns to peril it with younger men.\" \n\nAnd, greatly moved, then Rustum made reply:--\n\"O Gudurz, wherefore dost thou say such words?\nThou knowest better words than this to say.\nWhat is one more, one less, obscure or famed,\nValiant or craven, young or old, to me?\nAre not they mortal, am not I myself?\nBut who for men of nought would do great deeds?\nCome, thou shalt see how Rustum hoards his fame!\nBut I will fight unknown, and in plain arms;\nLet not men say of Rustum, he was match'd\nIn single fight with any mortal man.\" \n\nHe spoke, and frown'd; and Gudurz turn'd, and ran\nBack quickly through the camp in fear and joy--\nFear at his wrath, but joy that Rustum came.\nBut Rustum strode to his tent-door, and call'd\nHis followers in, and bade them bring his arms,\nAnd clad himself in steel; the arms he chose\nWere plain, and on his shield was no device,\nOnly his helm was rich, inlaid with gold,\nAnd, from the fluted spine atop, a plume\nOf horsehair waved, a scarlet horsehair plume.\nSo arm'd, he issued forth; and Ruksh, his horse,\nFollow'd him like a faithful hound at heel--\nRuksh, whose renown was noised through all the earth,\nThe horse, whom Rustum on a foray once\nDid in Bokhara by the river find\nA colt beneath its dam, and drove him home,\nAnd rear'd him; a bright bay, with lofty crest,\nDight with a saddle-cloth of broider'd green\nCrusted with gold, and on the ground were work'd\nAll beasts of chase, all beasts which hunters know.\nSo follow'd, Rustum left his tents, and cross'd\nThe camp, and to the Persian host appear'd.\nAnd all the Persians knew him, and with shouts\nHail'd; but the Tartars knew not who he was.\nAnd dear as the wet diver to the eyes\nOf his pale wife who waits and weeps on shore,\nBy sandy Bahrein, in the Persian Gulf,\nPlunging all day in the blue waves, at night,\nHaving made up his tale of precious pearls,\nRejoins her in their hut upon the sands--\nSo dear to the pale Persians Rustum came. \n\nAnd Rustum to the Persian front advanced,\nAnd Sohrab arm'd in Haman's tent, and came.\nAnd as afield the reapers cut a swath\nDown through the middle of a rich man's corn,\nAnd on each side are squares of standing corn,\nAnd in the midst a stubble, short and bare--\nSo on each side were squares of men, with spears\nBristling, and in the midst, the open sand.\nAnd Rustum came upon the sand, and cast\nHis eyes toward the Tartar tents, and saw\nSohrab come forth, and eyed him as he came. \n\nAs some rich woman, on a winter's morn,\nEyes through her silken curtains the poor drudge\nWho with numb blacken'd fingers makes her fire--\nAt cock-crow, on a starlit winter's morn,\nWhen the frost flowers the whiten'd window-panes--\nAnd wonders how she lives, and what the thoughts\nOf that poor drudge may be; so Rustum eyed\nThe unknown adventurous youth, who from afar\nCame seeking Rustum, and defying forth\nAll the most valiant chiefs; long he perused\nHis spirited air, and wonder'd who he was.\nFor very young he seem'd, tenderly rear'd;\nLike some young cypress, tall, and dark, and straight,\nWhich in a queen's secluded garden throws\nIts slight dark shadow on the moonlit turf,\nBy midnight, to a bubbling fountain's sound--\nSo slender Sohrab seem'd, so softly rear'd.\nAnd a deep pity enter'd Rustum's soul\nAs he beheld him coming; and he stood,\nAnd beckon'd to him with his hand, and said:-- \n\n\"O thou young man, the air of Heaven is soft,\nAnd warm, and pleasant; but the grave is cold!\nHeaven's air is better than the cold dead grave.\nBehold me! I am vast, and clad in iron,\nAnd tried; and I have stood on many a field\nOf blood, and I have fought with many a foe--\nNever was that field lost, or that foe saved.\nO Sohrab, wherefore wilt thou rush on death?\nBe govern'd! quit the Tartar host, and come\nTo Iran, and be as my son to me,\nAnd fight beneath my banner till I die!\nThere are no youths in Iran brave as thou.\" \n\nSo he spake, mildly; Sohrab heard his voice,\nThe mighty voice of Rustum, and he saw\nHis giant figure planted on the sand,\nSole, like some single tower, which a chief\nHath builded on the waste in former years\nAgainst the robbers; and he saw that head,\nStreak'd with its first grey hairs;--hope filled his soul,\nAnd he ran forward and embraced his knees\nAnd clasp'd his hand within his own, and said:-- \n\n\"O, by thy father's head! by thine own soul!\nArt thou not Rustum? speak! art thou not he?\" \n\nBut Rustum eyed askance the kneeling youth,\nAnd turn'd away, and spake to his own soul:-- \n\n\"Ah me, I muse what this young fox may mean!\nFalse, wily, boastful, are these Tartar boys.\nFor if I now confess this thing he asks,\nAnd hide it not, but say: Rustum is here!\nHe will not yield indeed, nor quit our foes,\nBut he will find some pretext not to fight,\nAnd praise my fame, and proffer courteous gifts,\nA belt or sword perhaps, and go his way.\nAnd on a feast-tide, in Afrasiab's hall,\nIn Samarcand, he will arise and cry:\n'I challenged once, when the two armies camp'd\nBeside the Oxus, all the Persian lords\nTo cope with me in single fight; but they\nShrank, only Rustum dared; then he and I\nChanged gifts, and went on equal terms away.'\nSo will he speak, perhaps, while men applaud;\nThen were the chiefs of Iran shamed through me.\" \n\nAnd then he turn'd, and sternly spake aloud:--\n'Rise! wherefore dost thou vainly question thus\nOf Rustum? I am here, whom thou hast call'd\nBy challenge forth; make good thy vaunt, or yield!\nIs it with Rustum only thou wouldst fight?\nRash boy, men look on Rustum's face and flee\nFor well I know, that did great Rustum stand\nBefore thy face this day, and were reveal'd,\nThere would be then no talk of fighting more.\nBut being what I am, I tell thee this--\nDo thou record it in thine inmost soul:\nEither thou shalt renounce thy vaunt and yield,\nOr else thy bones shall strew this sand, till winds\nBleach them, or Oxus with his summer-floods,\nOxus in summer wash them all away.\" \n\nHe spoke; and Sohrab answer'd, on his feet:--\n\"Art thou so fierce? Thou wilt not fright me so!\nI am no girl, to be made pale by words.\nYet this thou hast said well, did Rustum stand\nHere on this field, there were no fighting then.\nBut Rustum is far hence, and we stand here.\nBegin! thou art more vast, more dread than I,\nAnd thou art proved, I know, and I am young--\nBut yet success sways with the breath of Heaven.\nAnd though thou thinkest that thou knowest sure\nThy victory, yet thou canst not surely know.\nFor we are all, like swimmers in the sea,\nPoised on the top of a huge wave of fate,\nWhich hangs uncertain to which side to fall.\nAnd whether it will heave us up to land,\nOr whether it will roll us out to sea,\nBack out to sea, to the deep waves of death,\nWe know not, and no search will make us know;\nOnly the event will teach us in its hour.\" \n\nHe spoke, and Rustum answer'd not, but hurl'd\nHis spear; down from the shoulder, down it came,\nAs on some partridge in the corn a hawk,\nThat long has tower'd in the airy clouds,\nDrops like a plummet; Sohrab saw it come,\nAnd sprang aside, quick as a flash; the spear\nHiss'd, and went quivering down into the sand,\nWhich it sent flying wide;--then Sohrab threw\nIn turn, and full struck Rustum's shield; sharp rang,\nThe iron plates rang sharp, but turn'd the spear.\nAnd Rustum seized his club, which none but he\nCould wield; an unlopp'd trunk it was, and huge,\nStill rough--like those which men in treeless plains\nTo build them boats fish from the flooded rivers,\nHyphasis or Hydaspes, when, high up\nBy their dark springs, the wind in winter-time\nHath made in Himalayan forests wrack,\nAnd strewn the channels with torn boughs--so huge\nThe club which Rustum lifted now, and struck\nOne stroke; but again Sohrab sprang aside,\nLithe as the glancing snake, and the club came\nThundering to earth, and leapt from Rustum's hand.\nAnd Rustum follow'd his own blow, and fell\nTo his knees, and with his fingers clutch'd the sand;\nAnd now might Sohrab have unsheathed his sword,\nAnd pierced the mighty Rustum while he lay\nDizzy, and on his knees, and choked with sand;\nBut he look'd on, and smiled, nor bared his sword,\nBut courteously drew back, and spoke, and said:-- \n\n\"Thou strik'st too hard! that club of thine will float\nUpon the summer-floods, and not my bones.\nBut rise, and be not wroth! not wroth am I;\nNo, when I see thee, wrath forsakes my soul.\nThou say'st, thou art not Rustum; be it so!\nWho art thou then, that canst so touch my soul?\nBoy as I am, I have seen battles too--\nHave waded foremost in their bloody waves,\nAnd heard their hollow roar of dying men;\nBut never was my heart thus touch'd before.\nAre they from Heaven, these softenings of the heart?\nO thou old warrior, let us yield to Heaven!\nCome, plant we here in earth our angry spears,\nAnd make a truce, and sit upon this sand,\nAnd pledge each other in red wine, like friends,\nAnd thou shalt talk to me of Rustum's deeds.\nThere are enough foes in the Persian host,\nWhom I may meet, and strike, and feel no pang;\nChampions enough Afrasiab has, whom thou\nMayst fight; fight them, when they confront thy spear! \nBut oh, let there be peace 'twixt thee and me!\" \n\nHe ceased, but while he spake, Rustum had risen,\nAnd stood erect, trembling with rage; his club\nHe left to lie, but had regain'd his spear,\nWhose fiery point now in his mail'd right-hand\nBlazed bright and baleful, like that autumn-star,\nThe baleful sign of fevers; dust had soil'd\nHis stately crest, and dimm'd his glittering arms.\nHis breast heaved, his lips foam'd, and twice his voice\nWas choked with rage; at last these words broke way.-- \n\n\"Girl! nimble with thy feet, not with thy hands!\nCurl'd minion, dancer, coiner of sweet words!\nFight, let me hear thy hateful voice no more!\nThou art not in Afrasiab's gardens now \nWith Tartar girls, with whom thou art wont to dance;\nBut on the Oxus-sands, and in the dance\nOf battle, and with me, who make no play\nOf war; I fight it out, and hand to hand.\nSpeak not to me of truce, and pledge, and wine!\nRemember all thy valour; try thy feints\nAnd cunning! all the pity I had is gone;\nBecause thou hast shamed me before both the hosts\nWith thy light skipping tricks, and thy girl's wiles.\" \n\nHe spoke, and Sohrab kindled at his taunts, \nAnd he too drew his sword; at once they rush'd\nTogether, as two eagles on one prey\nCome rushing down together from the clouds,\nOne from the east, one from the west; their shields\nDash'd with a clang together, and a din\nRose, such as that the sinewy woodcutters\nMake often in the forest's heart at morn,\nOf hewing axes, crashing trees--such blows\nRustum and Sohrab on each other hail'd.\nAnd you would say that sun and stars took part\nIn that unnatural conflict; for a cloud\nGrew suddenly in Heaven, and dark'd the sun\nOver the fighters' heads; and a wind rose\nUnder their feet, and moaning swept the plain,\nAnd in a sandy whirlwind wrapp'd the pair.\nIn gloom they twain were wrapp'd, and they alone;\nFor both the on-looking hosts on either hand\nStood in broad daylight, and the sky was pure,\nAnd the sun sparkled on the Oxus stream.\nBut in the gloom they fought, with bloodshot eyes\nAnd labouring breath; first Rustum struck the shield\nWhich Sohrab held stiff out; the steel-spiked spear\nRent the tough plates, but fail'd to reach the skin,\nAnd Rustum pluck'd it back with angry groan. \nThen Sohrab with his sword smote Rustum's helm,\nNor clove its steel quite through; but all the crest\nHe shore away, and that proud horsehair plume,\nNever till now defiled, sank to the dust;\nAnd Rustum bow'd his head; but then the gloom\nGrew blacker, thunder rumbled in the air,\nAnd lightnings rent the cloud; and Ruksh, the horse,\nWho stood at hand, utter'd a dreadful cry;--\nNo horse's cry was that, most like the roar\nOf some pain'd desert-lion, who all day\nHath trail'd the hunter's javelin in his side,\nAnd comes at night to die upon the sand.\nThe two hosts heard that cry, and quaked for fear,\nAnd Oxus curdled as it cross'd his stream.\nBut Sohrab heard, and quail'd not, but rush'd on,\nAnd struck again; and again Rustum bow'd\nHis head; but this time all the blade, like glass,\nSprang in a thousand shivers on the helm,\nAnd in the hand the hilt remain'd alone.\nThen Rustum raised his head; his dreadful eyes\nGlared, and he shook on high his menacing spear,\nAnd shouted: Rustum!--Sohrab heard that shout,\nAnd shrank amazed; back he recoil'd one step,\nAnd scann'd with blinking eyes the advancing form,\nAnd then he stood bewilder'd; and he dropp'd\nHis covering shield, and the spear pierced his side.\nHe reel'd, and staggering back, sank to the ground;\nAnd then the gloom dispersed, and the wind fell,\nAnd the bright sun broke forth, and melted all\nThe cloud; and the two armies saw the pair--\nSaw Rustum standing, safe upon his feet,\nAnd Sohrab, wounded, on the bloody sand. \n\nThen, with a bitter smile, Rustum began:--\n\"Sohrab, thou thoughtest in thy mind to kill\nA Persian lord this day, and strip his corpse\nAnd bear thy trophies to Afrasiab's tent.\nOr else that the great Rustum would come down\nHimself to fight, and that thy wiles would move\nHis heart to take a gift, and let thee go.\nAnd then that all the Tartar host would praise\nThy courage or thy craft, and spread thy fame,\nTo glad thy father in his weak old age.\nFool, thou art slain, and by an unknown man!\nDearer to the red jackals shalt thou be\nThan to thy friends, and to thy father old.\" \n\nAnd, with a fearless mien, Sohrab replied:--\n\"Unknown thou art; yet thy fierce vaunt is vain.\nThou dost not slay me, proud and boastful man!\nNo! Rustum slays me, and this filial heart.\nFor were I match'd with ten such men as thee,\nAnd I were that which till to-day I was,\nThey should be lying here, I standing there.\nBut that belov\u00e8d name unnerved my arm--\nThat name, and something, I confess, in thee,\nWhich troubles all my heart, and made my shield\nFall; and thy spear transfix'd an unarm'd foe.\nAnd now thou boastest, and insult'st my fate.\nBut hear thou this, fierce man, tremble to hear:\nThe mighty Rustum shall avenge my death!\nMy father, whom I seek through all the world,\nHe shall avenge my death, and punish thee!\" \n\nAs when some hunter in the spring hath found\nA breeding eagle sitting on her nest,\nUpon the craggy isle of a hill-lake,\nAnd pierced her with an arrow as she rose,\nAnd follow'd her to find her where she fell\nFar off;--anon her mate comes winging back\nFrom hunting, and a great way off descries\nHis huddling young left sole; at that, he checks\nHis pinion, and with short uneasy sweeps\nCircles above his eyry, with loud screams\nChiding his mate back to her nest; but she\nLies dying, with the arrow in her side,\nIn some far stony gorge out of his ken,\nA heap of fluttering feathers--never more\nShall the lake glass her, flying over it;\nNever the black and dripping precipices\nEcho her stormy scream as she sails by--\nAs that poor bird flies home, nor knows his loss, \nSo Rustum knew not his own loss, but stood\nOver his dying son, and knew him not. \n\nBut, with a cold, incredulous voice, he said:--\n\"What prate is this of fathers and revenge?\nThe mighty Rustum never had a son.\"\n\nAnd, with a failing voice, Sohrab replied:--\n\"Ah yes, he had! and that lost son am I.\nSurely the news will one day reach his ear,\nReach Rustum, where he sits, and tarries long,\nSomewhere, I know not where, but far from here;\nAnd pierce him like a stab, and make him leap\nTo arms, and cry for vengeance upon thee.\nFierce man, bethink thee, for an only son!\nWhat will that grief, what will that vengeance be?\nOh, could I live, till I that grief had seen!\nYet him I pity not so much, but her,\nMy mother, who in Ader-baijan dwells\nWith that old king, her father, who grows grey\nWith age, and rules over the valiant Koords.\nHer most I pity, who no more will see\nSohrab returning from the Tartar camp,\nWith spoils and honour, when the war is done.\nBut a dark rumour will be bruited up,\nFrom tribe to tribe, until it reach her ear;\nAnd then will that defenceless woman learn\nThat Sohrab will rejoice her sight no more,\nBut that in battle with a nameless foe,\nBy the far-distant Oxus, he is slain.\" \n\nHe spoke; and as he ceased, he wept aloud,\nThinking of her he left, and his own death.\nHe spoke; but Rustum listen'd, plunged in thought.\nNor did he yet believe it was his son\nWho spoke, although he call'd back names he knew;\nFor he had had sure tidings that the babe,\nWhich was in Ader-baijan born to him,\nHad been a puny girl, no boy at all--\nSo that sad mother sent him word, for fear\nRustum should seek the boy, to train in arms.\nAnd so he deem'd that either Sohrab took,\nBy a false boast, the style of Rustum's son;\nOr that men gave it him, to swell his fame.\nSo deem'd he; yet he listen'd, plunged in thought\nAnd his soul set to grief, as the vast tide\nOf the bright rocking Ocean sets to shore\nAt the full moon; tears gather'd in his eyes;\nFor he remember'd his own early youth,\nAnd all its bounding rapture; as, at dawn,\nThe shepherd from his mountain-lodge descries\nA far, bright city, smitten by the sun,\nThrough many rolling clouds---so Rustum saw\nHis youth; saw Sohrab's mother, in her bloom;\nAnd that old king, her father, who loved well\nHis wandering guest, and gave him his fair child\nWith joy; and all the pleasant life they led,\nThey three, in that long-distant summer-time--\nThe castle, and the dewy woods, and hunt\nAnd hound, and morn on those delightful hills\nIn Ader-baijan. And he saw that Youth,\nOf age and looks to be his own dear son,\nPiteous and lovely, lying on the sand,\nLike some rich hyacinth which by the scythe\nOf an unskilful gardener has been cut,\nMowing the garden grass-plots near its bed,\nAnd lies, a fragrant tower of purple bloom,\nOn the mown, dying grass--so Sohrab lay,\nLovely in death, upon the common sand.\nAnd Rustum gazed on him with grief, and said:-- \n\n\"O Sohrab, thou indeed art such a son\nWhom Rustum, wert thou his, might well have loved!\nYet here thou errest, Sohrab, or else men\nHave told thee false--thou art not Rustum's son.\nFor Rustum had no son; one child he had--\nBut one--a girl; who with her mother now\nPlies some light female task, nor dreams of us--\nOf us she dreams not, nor of wounds, nor war.\" \n\nBut Sohrab answer'd him in wrath: for now\nThe anguish of the deep-fix'd spear grew fierce,\nAnd he desired to draw forth the steel,\nAnd let the blood flow free, and so to die--\nBut first he would convince his stubborn foe;\nAnd, rising sternly on one arm, he said:-- \n\n\"Man, who art thou who dost deny my words?\nTruth sits upon the lips of dying men,\nAnd falsehood, while I lived, was far from mine.\nI tell thee, prick'd upon this arm I bear\nThat seal which Rustum to my mother gave,\nThat she might prick it on the babe she bore.\" \n\nHe spoke; and all the blood left Rustum's cheeks,\nAnd his knees totter'd, and he smote his hand\nAgainst his breast, his heavy mailed hand,\nThat the hard iron corslet clank'd aloud;\nAnd to his heart he press'd the other hand,\nAnd in a hollow voice he spake, and said:-- \n\nSohrab, that were a proof which could not lie!\nIf thou show this, then art thou Rustum's son.\" \n\nThen, with weak hasty fingers, Sohrab loosed\nHis belt, and near the shoulder bared his arm,\nAnd show'd a sign in faint vermilion points\nPrick'd; as a cunning workman, in Pekin,\nPricks with vermilion some clear porcelain vase,\nAn emperor's gift--at early morn he paints,\nAnd all day long, and, when night comes, the lamp\nLights up his studious forehead and thin hands--\nSo delicately prick'd the sign appear'd\nOn Sohrab's arm, the sign of Rustum's seal.\nIt was that griffin, which of old rear'd Zal,\nRustum's great father, whom they left to die,\nA helpless babe, among the mountain-rocks;\nHim that kind creature found, and rear'd, and loved--\nThen Rustum took it for his glorious sign.\nAnd Sohrab bared that image on his arm,\nAnd himself scann'd it long with mournful eyes,\nAnd then he touch'd it with his hand and said:-- \n\n\"How say'st thou? Is that sign the proper sign\nOf Rustum's son, or of some other man's?\" \n\nHe spoke; but Rustum gazed, and gazed, and stood\nSpeechless; and then he utter'd one sharp cry:\nO boy--thy father!--and his voice choked there.\nAnd then a dark cloud pass'd before his eyes,\nAnd his head swam, and he sank down to earth.\nBut Sohrab crawl'd to where he lay, and cast\nHis arms about his neck, and kiss'd his lips,\nAnd with fond faltering fingers stroked his cheeks,\nTrying to call him back to life; and life\nCame back to Rustum, and he oped his eyes,\nAnd they stood wide with horror; and he seized\nIn both his hands the dust which lay around,\nAnd threw it on his head, and smirch'd his hair,--\nHis hair, and face, and beard, and glittering arms;\nAnd strong convulsive groanings shook his breast,\nAnd his sobs choked him; and he clutch'd his sword,\nTo draw it, and for ever let life out.\nBut Sohrab saw his thoughts, and held his hands\nAnd with a soothing voice he spake, and said:-- \n\n\"Father, forbear! for I but meet to-day\nThe doom which at my birth was written down\nIn Heaven, and thou art Heaven's unconscious hand.\nSurely my heart cried out that it was thou,\nWhen first I saw thee; and thy heart spoke too,\nI know it! but fate trod those promptings down\nUnder its iron heel; fate, fate engaged\nThe strife, and hurl'd me on my father's spear.\nBut let us speak no more of this! I find\nMy father; let me feel that I have found!\nCome, sit beside me on this sand, and take\nMy head betwixt thy hands, and kiss my cheeks,\nAnd wash them with thy tears, and say: My son!\nQuick! quick! for number'd are my sands of life\nAnd swift; for like the lightning to this field\nI came, and like the wind I go away--\nSudden, and swift, and like a passing wind.\nBut it was writ in Heaven that this should be.\" \n\nSo said he, and his voice released the heart\nOf Rustum, and his tears broke forth; he cast\nHis arms round his son's neck, and wept aloud,\nAnd kiss'd him. And awe fell on both the hosts,\nWhen they saw Rustum's grief; and Ruksh, the horse,\nWith his head bowing to the ground and mane\nSweeping the dust, came near, and in mute woe\nFirst to the one then to the other moved\nHis head, as if enquiring what their grief\nMight mean; and from his dark, compassionate eyes,\nThe big warm tears roll'd down, and caked the sand.\nBut Rustum chid him with stern voice, and said:-- \n\n\"Ruksh, now thou grievest; but, O Ruksh, thy feet\nShould first have rotted on their nimble joints,\nOr ere they brought thy master to this field!\" \n\nBut Sohrab look'd upon the horse and said;--\n\"Is this, then, Ruksh? How often, in past days\nMy mother told me of thee, thou brave steed,\nMy terrible father's terrible horse! and said,\nThat I should one day find thy lord and thee.\nCome, let me lay my hand upon thy mane!\nO Ruksh, thou art more fortunate than I;\nFor thou has gone where I shall never go,\nAnd snuff'd the breezes of my father's home.\nAnd thou hast trod the sands of Seistan\nAnd seen the River of Helmund, and the Lake\nOf Zirrah; and the aged Zal himself\nHas often stroked thy neck, and given thee food,\nCorn in a golden platter soak'd with wine,\nAnd said; O Ruksh! bear Rustrum well!--but I\nHave never known my grandsire's furrow'd face,\nNor seen his lofty house in Seistan,\nNor slaked my thirst at the clear Helmund stream;\nBut lodged among my father's foes, and seen\nAfrasiab's cities only, Samarcand,\nBokhara, and lone Khiva in the waste,\nAnd the black Toorkmun tents; and only drunk\nThe desert rivers, Moorghab and Tejend,\nKohik, and where the Kalmuks feed their sheep,\nThe northern Sir; and this great Oxus stream,\nThe yellow Oxus, by whose brink I die.\" \n\nThen, with a heavy groan, Rustum bewail'd:--\n\"Oh, that its waves were flowing over me!\nOh, that I saw its grains of yellow silt\nRoll, tumbling in the current o'er my head!\" \n\nBut, with a grave mild voice, Sohrab replied:--\n\"Desire not that, my father! thou must live.\nFor some are born to do great deeds, and live,\nAs some are born to be obscured, and die.\nDo thou the deeds I die too young to do,\nAnd reap a second glory in thine age;\nThou art my father, and thy gain is mine.\nBut come! thou seest this great host of men\nWhich follow me; I pray thee, slay not these!\nLet me entreat for them; what have they done?\nThey follow'd me, my hope, my fame, my star.\nLet them all cross the Oxus back in peace.\nBut me thou must bear hence, not send with them,\nBut carry me with thee to Seistan,\nAnd place me on a bed, and mourn for me,\nThou, and the snow-hair'd Zal, and all thy friends.\nAnd thou must lay me in that lovely earth,\nAnd heap a stately mound above my bones,\nAnd plant a far-seen pillar over all.\nThat so the passing horseman on the waste\nMay see my tomb a great way off, and cry:\nSohral!, the mighty Rustum's son, lies there,\nWhom his great father did in ignorance kill!\nAnd I be not forgotten in my grave.\" \n\nAnd, with a mournful voice, Rustum replied:--\n\"Fear not! as thou hast said, Sohrab, my son,\nSo shall it be; for I will burn my tents,\nAnd quit the host, and bear thee hence with me,\nAnd carry thee away to Seistan,\nAnd place thee on a bed, and mourn for thee,\nWith the snow-headed Zal, and all my friends.\nAnd I will lay thee in the lovely earth,\nAnd heap a stately mound above thy bones,\nAnd plant a far-seen pillar over all,\nAnd men shall not forget thee in thy grave.\nAnd I will spare thy host; yea, let them go!\nLet them all cross the Oxus back in peace!\nWhat should I do with slaying any more?\nFor would that all whom I have ever slain\nMight be once more alive; my bitterest foes\nAnd they who were call'd champions in their time,\nAnd through whose death I won that fame I have--\nAnd I were nothing but a common man,\nA poor, mean soldier, and without renown,\nSo thou mightest live too, my son, my son!\nOr rather would that I, even I myself,\nMight now be lying on this bloody sand,\nNear death, and by an ignorant stroke of thine,\nNot thou of mine! and I might die, not thou;\nAnd I, not thou, be borne to Seistan;\nAnd Zal might weep above my grave, not thine;\nAnd say: O son, I weep thee not too sore,\nFor willingly, I know, thou met'st thine end!\nBut now in blood and battles was my youth,\nAnd full of blood and battles is my age,\nAnd I shall never end this life of blood.\" \n\nThen, at the point of death, Sohrab replied.--\n\"A life of blood indeed, thou dreadful man!\nBut thou shalt yet have peace; only not now,\nNot yet! but thou shalt have it on that day,\nWhen thou shalt sail in a high-masted ship,\nThou and the other peers of Kai Khosroo,\nReturning home over the salt blue sea,\nFrom laying thy dear master in his grave.\" \n\nAnd Rustum gazed in Sohrab's face, and said.--\n\"Soon be that day, my son, and deep that sea!\nTill then, if fate so wills, let me endure.\" \n\nHe spoke; and Sohrab smiled on him, and took\nThe spear, and drew it from his side, and eased\nHis wound's imperious anguish; but the blood\nCame welling from the open gash, and life\nFlow'd with the stream;--all down his cold white side\nThe crimson torrent ran, dim now and soil'd,\nLike the soil'd tissue of white violets\nLeft, freshly gather'd, on their native bank,\nBy children whom their nurses call with haste\nIndoors from the sun's eye; his head droop'd low,\nHis limbs grew slack; motionless, white, he lay--\nWhite, with eyes closed; only when heavy gasps,\nDeep heavy gasps quivering through all his frame,\nConvulsed him back to life, he open'd them,\nAnd fix'd them feebly on his father's face;\nTill now all strength was ebb'd, and from his limbs\nUnwillingly the spirit fled away,\nRegretting the warm mansion which it left,\nAnd youth, and bloom, and this delightful world. \n\nSo, on the bloody sand, Sohrab lay dead;\nAnd the great Rustum drew his horseman's cloak\nDown o'er his face, and sate by his dead son.\nAs those black granite pillars, once high-rear'd\nBy Jemshid in Persepolis, to bear\nHis house, now 'mid their broken flights of steps\nLie prone, enormous, down the mountain side--\nSo in the sand lay Rustum by his son. \n\nAnd night came down over the solemn waste,\nAnd the two gazing hosts, and that sole pair,\nAnd darken'd all; and a cold fog, with night,\nCrept from the Oxus. Soon a hum arose,\nAs of a great assembly loosed, and fires\nBegan to twinkle through the fog; for now\nBoth armies moved to camp, and took their meal;\nThe Persians took it on the open sands\nSouthward, the Tartars by the river marge;\nAnd Rustum and his son were left alone. \n\nBut the majestic river floated on,\nOut of the mist and hum of that low land,\nInto the frosty starlight, and there moved,\nRejoicing, through the hush'd Chorasmian waste,\nUnder the solitary moon;--he flow'd\nRight for the polar star, past Orgunj\u00e8,\nBrimming, and bright, and large; then sands begin\nTo hem his watery march, and dam his streams,\nAnd split his currents; that for many a league\nThe shorn and parcell'd Oxus strains along\nThrough beds of sand and matted rushy isles--\nOxus, forgetting the bright speed he had\nIn his high mountain-cradle in Pamere,\nA foil'd circuitous wanderer--till at last\nThe long'd-for dash of waves is heard, and wide\nHis luminous home of waters opens, bright\nAnd tranquil, from whose floor the new-bathed stars\nEmerge, and shine upon the Aral Sea."}
