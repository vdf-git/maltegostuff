{"subject": "Sonnet: When I Have Fears That I May Cease To Be", "text": "When I have fears that I may cease to be\nBefore my pen has glean'd my teeming brain, \nBefore high piled books, in charactry,\nHold like rich garners the full-ripen'd grain; \nWhen I behold, upon the night's starr'd face,\nHuge cloudy symbols of a high romance, \nAnd think that I may never live to trace \nTheir shadows, with the magic hand of chance; \nAnd when I feel, fair creature of an hour,\nThat I shall never look upon thee more,\nNever have relish in the faery power \nOf unreflecting love; -- then on the shore \nOf the wide world I stand alone, and think\nTill Love and Fame to nothingness do sink."}
