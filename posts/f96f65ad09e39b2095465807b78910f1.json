{"subject": "Out On The Moor", "text": "I HAVE been wandering to-day\nOut on the moor, and have seen\nThe country stretching far away,\nIn stony slopes and wastes of green.\nI watched the distant hill-tops lie\nOut in the sun-set fair and free,\nLike purple clouds across the sky,\n--And further still the line of sea.\nI heard the lark above me sing,\nI saw the plover flying near,\nAnd many a little hidden spring,\nAnd twinkling water brown and clear.\nAnd brightest sun and darkest shower,\nAnd day and night-time come to rest,\nWith toiling wind and tenderest flower,\nUpon the moor's untiring breast.\nWe falter in our smiles and tears,\nWe faint with joys and sorrows won,\nThe moors stretch out through all the years,\nIn perfect peace--till Time be done.\nAnd peace is love, dear love I know\nThere is no greater thing than this,\nIt is the utmost love can show,\nIt is the utmost love can miss.\nThe love within my soul for thee,\nBefore the world was had its birth,\nIt is the part God gives to me\nOf the great wisdom of the earth."}
