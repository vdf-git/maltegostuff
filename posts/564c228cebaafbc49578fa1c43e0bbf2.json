{"subject": "The Soldier\u2019s Death -", "text": "The day was o\u2019er, and in their tent the weaned victors met,\nIn wine and social gaiety the carnage to forget.\nThe merry laugh and sparkling jest, the pleasant tale were there\u2014\nEach heart was free and gladsome then, each brow devoid of care. \n\nYet one was absent from the board who ever was the first\nIn every joyous, festive scene, in every mirthful burst;\nHe also was the first to dare each perilous command,\nTo rush on danger\u2014yet was he the youngest of the band. \n\nUpon the battle-field he lay a damp and fearful grave;\nHis right hand grasped the cherished flag\u2014the flag he died to save;\nWhile the cold stars shone calmly down on heaps of fallen dead,\nAnd their pale light a halo cast round that fair sleeper\u2019s head. \n\nSay, was there none o\u2019er that young chief to shed one single tear,\nTo sorrow o\u2019er the end of his untimely stopt career?\nYes, but alas! the boundless sea its foam and crested wave,\nLay then between those beings dear and his cold, cheerless grave. \n\nWith all a mother\u2019s doting love a mother yearned for him,\nAnd watching for his quick return, a sister\u2019s eye grew dim,\nAnd, dearer still, a gentle girl, his fair affianced bride,\u2014\nAnd yet, with all these loving ones, unfriended, had he died. \n\nNo woman\u2019s low, sweet voice was near one soothing word to say\nOr gentle hand from his cold brow to wipe the damps away;\nBut yet why should we grieve for him, that hero gallant, brave?\nHis was a soldier\u2019s glorious death, a soldier\u2019s glorious grave!"}
