{"subject": "Premonition", "text": "I saw the Summer through her garden go,\nA marigold hung in her auburn hair,\nHer brown arms heaped with harvest, and the lair\nOf poppied plenty, like the peach aglow:\nAmong the pepper-pods, in scarlet row,\nAnd golden gourds and melons, where the pear\nAnd quince hung heavy, in the languid air\nShe laid her down and let her eyes close slow.\nNot so much breath as blows the thistle by,\nNot so much sound as rounds a cricket's croon,\nWas in her sleep, and yet about her seemed\nThe long dark sweep of rain, the whirling cry\nAnd roar of winds beneath a stormy moon.\nWas it a dream of Autumn that she dreamed?"}
