{"subject": "Of A' The Airts", "text": "Of a' the airts the wind can blaw\n   I dearly like the west,\nFor there the bonie lassie lives,\n   The lassie I lo'e best.\nThere wild woods grow and rivers row,\n   And monie a hill between;\nBut day and night my fancy's flight\n   Is ever wi' my Jean.\nI see her in the dewy flowers;\n   I see her sweet and fair:\nI hear her in the tunefu' birds;\n   I hear her charm the air.\nThere's not a bonie flower that springs\n   By fountain, shaw, or green;\nThere's not a bonie bird that sings,\n   But minds me o' my Jean."}
