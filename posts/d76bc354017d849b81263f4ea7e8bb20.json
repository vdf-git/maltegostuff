{"subject": "Gray Time", "text": "Oh, love your dog, your bed, your platter,\nBut do not love the gray time.\nA faithful dog will not so flatter\nAs gray time will flatter you.\n\nYour eye is not a nest for it.\nYour mirror, not a test for it.\nYour palate feels: won't go away.\n\nIt burns your pearls in despair.\nAnd you wake up: your wisest hair\nIs fooled and gray.\n\n1940"}
