{"subject": "The Leaving", "text": "I shall not love again, as in my youth,\n Nor find the comfort of our middle age,\n Yet from Life's book is missing one last page.\n And now I must confess I hid the truth.\n I could not let them hear your laboured breath,\n Nor let them see your anguish and your pain,\n Nor let them see my tears that fell like rain,\n Nor watch me, as inside I prayed for Death.\n I cannot let my feelings go; to grieve.\n For since the death my whole world fell apart.\n Now anger seems to fill my broken heart.\n Why did you have to go? Why did you leave?\n The pain goes with me; stalking me at night\n Like some vile monster; felt, but never seen,\n It follows me. It makes me feel unclean.\n I know that I'm afraid, but why the fright?\n Ours was a love you could not often find.\n Each touch, a fond embrace for me to keep.\n When darkness comes, I grieve, no more to sleep,\n For you have left this earth, and me, behind."}
