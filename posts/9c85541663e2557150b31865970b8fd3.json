{"subject": "Inez To Her Billet-Doux", "text": "Ah ! who would think, a thing so white\nCould e'er offend, a maiden's sight ?\nOh who so fair a thing would shun ?\nWhy one would think the cloistered nun.\nFrom penance free, might look upon,\nAnd read thee by her holy taper.\n\nMamma says thou art marked within,\nWith thoughts of frailty and sin ;\nThat cloistered nun, thou soon would'st move\nFrom beads and prayer books, off to rove,\nForget cohl vows, and live for love\nThou wicked little piece of paper !\n\nMamma's experience tells her so\u2014\nI'm sure I want experience too ;\nSo pretty little billet-doux\nWhy should I pout, and frown and vapour ?\nWhat though Mamma may not approve ?\nOne burning thought she can't remove\u2014\nThey live iojoy who live to love !\nThou darling little piece of paper."}
