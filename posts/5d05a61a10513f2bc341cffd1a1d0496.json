{"subject": "Edwin And Alicia", "text": "Many are the mournful stories\nWhich the page of love unfolds;\nMany are the piercing sorrows\nWhich that faithful record holds.\nLove, that jewel of our nature,\nParents oft have sought to buy;\nBut 'tis merit makes the purchase,\nOr 'tis fancy casts the die.\n'Tis not wealth, nor sordid riches,\nThat are treasures of the mind;\nNo;--'tis surely sweet contentment\nWhich in humble breasts we find.\nThink not, parents, that your children\nCan your sober plans pursue,\nOr your influence bind their natures\nE'er to think or act like you.\nFifty years have render'd callous\nThose affections which you blame;\nBut let Memory be recorder,\nAnd you'll find yours once the same.\nIf at twenty hearts were harden'd,\nAnd could every feeling brave;\nWhat would be their rigid natures\nEre they dropp'd into the grave!\nOnce within this happy island\nLiv'd a knight of mighty fame;\nBirth, and wealth, and growing greatness,\nFrom the world acquire a name.\nPride had mix'd with every honour,\nAnd ambition steel'd his breast;\nNor did there e'er one soft emotion\nMake atonement for the rest.\nYet the wise and gracious Donor\nHad one counter--gift bestow'd;\nAnd, to lead his soul to mercy,\nSweet Alicia points the road.\nYouth conjoin'd with all the Graces\nTaught the maiden how to move,\nAnd in every beauteous feature\nBeam'd benevolence and love.\nFlora, as she cross'd her garden,\nTwin'd the lily with the rose;\nAnd, when passing sweet Alicia,\nOn her head the gift bestows.\nForm'd by virtue and by nature\nFor the solace of some heart,\nMany a youth with noble fervour\nSought in her's to gain a part.\nMerit only caught the maiden,\nMerit made one youth belov'd;--\nEdwin durst not hope for favour,\nYet 'twas Edwin she approv'd.\nBirth nor riches gild his title,\nSimple worth is all his claim;\nYet she thinks that fair escutcheon\nBrightest in heraldic fame.\nBut, alas! the world's opinion\nWill not sanctify the thought;\nNor, Alicia, will thy father\nValue merit as it ought.\nLong was seen the lovely maiden\nIn dejection slowly move!\nSmiles forsook their former mansion\nAnd she fear'd the cause was love.\nThis the angry father told her,\nAnd as he told he scorn'd her woes;\nTo her child, blanch'd with emotion,\nThe unhappy mother goes.\n''Ah, my love, have you deceiv'd me!\nWhy not trust this feeling breast?\nSure thou knowest I'd die to save thee,\nDie to lull thy woes to rest.''\n''Yes; too well I know your goodness,\nGratitude now swells this heart;\nAnd when forc'd to pierce that bosom,\nThink but how my own must smart.\nYour inquiring looks have ask'd me\nOften--why the smother'd sigh?\nAnd your nice discernment told you\nEvery cause and reason why.\nOften have you seen my sorrow,\nSeen the anguish of my soul;\nEdwin--but I need not tell you,--\nEdwin does this heart controul!''\nThe gallant ship her wings unfurls,\nAnd speeds before the favouring wind;\nEdwin from his lov'd retreats\nReluctant hies to burning Ind.\n'Tis not change of place nor climate\nCan a rooted sorrow move;\nNeither is the power of absence\nEqual to the charm of love.\nEdwin found this truth, and, drooping,\nOn the Ganges' banks reclin'd;\nSultry suns seem'd in conjunction\nWith the fever of his mind.\nSad despair, and cruel absence,\nSwift the vital thread had worn;\nAnd upon his funeral bier\nHapless Edwin soon was borne.\nEqual grief by slower movements\nBrought Alicia to the tomb;\nDeep disease by secret workings\nUndermin'd her youthful bloom.\nAbsence all her comforts wasted,\nAll her joys with Edwin flew;\nThough each day her glowing fancy\nBrought her Edwin to her view.\nO'er her father's rigid nature\nDying sorrows now prevail;--\n''Live Alicia, live my daughter!\nNor on me thy woes entail.\nMy pride and hate I've now discarded;\nEdwin's merit claims thy hand;\nSoon, soon may propitious breezes\nWaft him to his native land!''\nJoy illum'd its former mansion,\nAlicia's eye again was bright;\nHope shone forth in rays of gladness,\nAnd her soul was all delight.\nBut ah, how short our gleams of pleasure!\nSorrow only seems to last;\nJoys, like arrows, swiftly flying,\nScarce are seen ere they are past.\nAlicia heard her Edwin's story,\nThen sweet hope for ever fled;\nEvery look declar'd her dying,\nAnd how much she wish'd her dead.\nSoon her wishes were accomplish'd,\nSoon she breath'd her latest breath;\nAnd her parents mourn'd, heartbroken,\nTheir dear Alicia till their death.\nYearly shall the village maidens\nVisit poor Alicia's tomb,\nAnd, as they list her simple story,\nStrow fresh flowers of fairest bloom."}
