{"subject": "Rendezvous", "text": "Long before the dawn breaks\n\nWith a bird's cry,\n\nI'll be hustling on the wind\n\nOut where you lie -\n\nHurrying to our rendezvous\n\nUnder the April sky.\n\nI'll step from out the sea again\n\nTo the shoulder of the land,\n\nAnd pass the dead boy where he lies\n\nProne on the tideless strand,\n\nTreading lightly lest I move\n\nHis fingers in the sand.\n\nDo you remember how you stopped\n\nAfter the sudden climb,\n\nSniffing the air as one who comes\n\nOn a holy thing sublime?\n\nI'll meet you where the breeze brought\n\nThe first sent of thyme.\n\nI'll meet you where we yearned that morn.\n\nUnder the April sky,\n\nWaiting on our bellies there\n\nFor the battle cry.\n\nI'll meet you where I left you there\n\nLying all awry.\n\nYou said, \"We will continue the\n\nDiscussion by and by.\"\n\n. . . . . . . .\n\nIf I could but remember what\n\nWe spoke of, you and I!"}
