{"subject": "Maundy Thursday", "text": "Between the brown hands of a server-lad\nThe silver cross was offered to be kissed.\nThe men came up, lugubrious, but not sad,\nAnd knelt reluctantly, half-prejudiced.\n(And kissing, kissed the emblem of a creed.)\nThen mourning women knelt; meek mouths they had,\n(And kissed the Body of the Christ indeed.)\nYoung children came, with eager lips and glad.\n(These kissed a silver doll, immensely bright.)\nThen I, too, knelt before that acolyte.\nAbove the crucifix I bent my head:\nThe Christ was thin, and cold, and very dead:\nAnd yet I bowed, yea, kissed - my lips did cling.\n(I kissed the warm live hand that held the thing.)"}
