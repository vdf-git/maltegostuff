{"subject": "True Love Is Watered Aye Wi' Tears", "text": "True love is water'd aye wi' tears,\nIt grows 'neath stormy skies,\nIt's fenced around wi' hopes and fears,\nAn' fann'd wi' heartfelt sighs.\nWi' chains o' gowd 'twill no be bound,\nOh! wha the heart can buy?\nThe titled glare, the warldling's care -\nEven absence 'twill defy,\nEven absence 'twill defy.\n\nAnd time, that kills a' ither things,\nHis withering touch 'twill brave,\n'Twill live in joy, 'twill live in grief,\n'Twill live beyond the grave!\n'Twill live, 'twill live though buried deep,\nIn true hearts' memorie -\nOh! we forgot that ane sae fair,\nSae bricht, sae young, could dee,\nSae young could dee.\n\nUnfeeling hands may touch the chord\nWhere buried griefs do lie-\nHow many silent agonies\nMay that rude touch untie!\nBut oh! I love that plaintive lay\nThe dear auld melodie!\nFor, oh, 'tis sweet! - yet I maun greet,\nFor it was sung by thee, \nSung by thee!\n\nThey may forget wha lichtly love,\nOr feel but beauty's chain;\nBut they wha loved a heavenly mind\nOh! a' my dreams o' warld's gude\nAye were intwined wi' thee,\nBut I leant on a broken reed\nWhich soon was ta'en frae me,\nTa'en frae me.\n\n'Tis weel, 'tis weel, we dinna ken\nWhat we may live to see,\n'Twas Mercy's hand that hung the veil\nO'er dark futurity!\nOh! ye whase hearts are scathed and riven,\nWha feel the warld is vain,\nOh, fix your broken earthly ties\nWhere they ne'er will break again,\nBreak again!"}
