{"subject": "Lines, Written Oct. 15, 1836, Being The Anniversary Of My Daughter's Decease, And Two Years After That Event.", "text": "Dark is the day,\nDun twilight only wakes upon the hill;\nPale is the ray\nOf sunbeam slanting through the wind-gust chill;\nDim comes the morn,\nCloud-bound and gloomy hangs the brow of noon;\nEvening, down-borne,\nBrings o'er us darkness vast,\u2014no star, no moon!\n\nHark! to yon sound\nBy gleam-lit clough, shorn slope, and dusky plain;\nThe winds unbound,\nLike unseen hunters, hurry past again.\nHark! to their moan,\nLike note of deep-mouth'd hound, afar away;\nNow wilder tone\nIs heard,\u2014shrill cry, and wailing of dismay!\n\nCold is the air\u2014\nThe burden'd clouds are bow'd with chilly rain;\nHedges are bare,\nAnd cheerless birds from notes of joy refrain.\nThe giant stems,\nStorm-swept, are waving in the wintry sky;\nTheir summer gems\nLie strewn and perishing where mine doth lie.\n\nThe dearest gem\nThat e'er was treasur'd near a parent's heart;\nToo pure a gem\nFor human life, to heaven she must depart!\nOh! child of love,\nLet us behold thee, earth-ward if thou stray!\nCome from above\nOn radiant wing, come in thy bright array!\n\nOh! blessed one,\nCould we behold thee even as thou wert,\nCall thee our own,\nAnd press our angel unto mortal heart!\nThen would these tears\nWhich oft have flowed since thy dying hour,\nDark months and years,\nBe stay'd,\u2014thou still would'st have that soothing pow'r!"}
