{"subject": "Come To Me When I'M Dying", "text": "A SONG.\n\nCome to me when I'm dying;\nGaze on my wasted form,\nTired with so long defying\nLife's ever-rushing storm.\nCome, come when I am dying,\nAnd stand beside my bed,\nEre yet my soul is flying,\nAnd I am cold and dead.\n\nBend low and lower o'er me,\nFor I've a word to say\nThough death is just before me,\nEre I can go away.\nNow that my soul is hovering\nUpon the verge of day,\nFor thee I'll lift the covering\nThat veils its quivering ray.\n\nO, ne'er had I thus spoken\nIn health's bright, rosy glow!\nBut death my pride hath broken,\nAnd brought my spirit low.\nThough now this last revealing\nQuickens life's curdling springs,\nAnd a half-timid feeling\nFaint flushes o'er me flings.\n\nBend lower yet above me,\nFor I would have thee know\nHow passing well I love thee,\nAnd joy to tell thee so.\nThis love, so purely welling\nUp in this heart of mine,\nO, hath it e'er found dwelling\nWithin thy spirit's shrine?\n\nI've prayed my God, in meekness,\nTo give me some control\nOver this earthly weakness\nThat so enthralled my soul;\nAnd now my soul rejoices\nWhile sweetly-thrilling strains,\nFrom low, harmonious voices,\nSoothe all my dying pains.\n\nThey sing of the Eternal,\nWhose throne is far above,\nWhere zephyrs softly vernal\nFloat over bowers of love;\nOf hopes and joys, earth-blighted,\nBlooming 'neath cloudless skies,\nOf hearts and souls united\nIn love that never dies.\n\n'Tis there, 'tis there I'll meet thee\nWhen life's brief day is o'er;\nO, with what joy to greet thee\nOn that eternal shore!\nFarewell! for death is chilling\nMy pulses swift and fast;\nAnd yet in God I'm willing\nThis hour should be my last.\n\nSometimes, when day declineth,\nAnd all the gorgeous west\nIn gold and purple shineth,\nGo to my place of rest;\nAnd if thy voice in weeping,\nIs borne upon the air,\nThink not of me as sleeping;\nAll cold and silent there:--\n\nBut turn, with glances tender,\nToward a shining star,\nWhose rays with chastened splendor\nFall on thee from afar.\nAnd know the blissful dwelling\nWhere I am waiting thee,\nWhen Jordan fiercely swelling\nShall set thy spirit free."}
