{"subject": "As In A Pond", "text": "As in a pond that sleeps o'erhung by trees,\nTwo things at once in many a soul one sees :--\nThe sky, which points, the surface pure and calm,\nWith all its rays and clouds the heart to charm;\nAnd then the depth, slime, hideous, dark, and dead,\nWhere foul black reptiles swarm, and vaguely tread."}
