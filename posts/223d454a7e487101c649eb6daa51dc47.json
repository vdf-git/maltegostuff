{"subject": "Great Twin Brethren, The", "text": "The battle will not cease \nTill once again on those white steeds ye ride, \nO heaven-descended Twins, \nBefore humanity's bewildered host. \nOur javelins \nFly wide, \nAnd idle is our cannon's boast. \nLead us, triumphant Brethren, Love and Peace. \nA fairer Golden Fleece \nOur more adventurous Argo fain would seek, \nBut save, O Sons of Jove, \nYour blended light go with us, vain employ \nIt were to rove \nThis bleak, \nBlind waste. To unimagined joy \nGuide us, immortal Brethren, Love and Peace."}
