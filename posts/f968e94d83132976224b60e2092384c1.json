{"subject": "The Wolf And Shepherds. A Fable", "text": "Laws, as we read in ancient sages,\nHave been like cobwebs in all ages:\nCobwebs for little flies are spread,\nAnd laws for little folks are made;\nBut if an insect of renown,\nHornet or beetle, wasp or drone,\nBe caught in quest of sport or plunder,\nThe flimsy fetter flies in sunder.\nYour simile perhaps may please one\nWith whom wit holds the place of reason:\nBut can you prove that this in fact is\nAgreeable to life and practice?\nThen hear, what in his simple way\nOld \u00c6sop told me t' other day.\nIn days of yore, but (which is very odd)\nOur author mentions not the period,\nWe mortal men, less given to speeches,\nAllow'd the beasts sometimes to teach us.\nBut now we all are prattlers grown,\nAnd suffer no voice but our own;\nWith us no beast has leave to speak,\nAlthough his honest heart should break.\n'Tis true, your asses and your apes,\nAnd other brutes in human shapes,\nAnd that thing made of sound and show,\nWhich mortals have misnamed a beau,\n(But in the language of the sky\nIs call'd a two-legg'd butterfly),\nWill make your very heartstrings ache\nWith loud and everlasting clack,\nAnd beat your auditory drum,\nTill you grow deaf, or they grow dumb.\nBut to our story we return:\n'Twas early on a Summer morn,\nA Wolf forsook the mountain den,\nAnd issued hungry on the plain.\nFull many a stream and lawn he past\nAnd reach'd a winding vale at last;\nWhere from a hollow rock he spied\nThe shepherds drest in flowery pride.\nGarlands were strew'd, and all was gay,\nTo celebrate a holiday.\nThe merry tabor's gamesome sound\nProvoked the sprightly dance around.\nHard by a rural board was rear'd,\nOn which in fair array appear'd\nThe peach, the apple, and the raisin,\nAnd all the fruitage of the season.\nBut, more distinguish'd than the rest,\nWas seen a wether ready drest,\nThat smoking, recent from the flame,\nDiffused a stomach-rousing steam.\nOur Wolf could not endure the sight,\nCourageous grew his appetite:\nHis entrails groan'd with tenfold pain,\nHe lick'd his lips, and lick'd again:\nAt last, with lightning in his eyes,\nHe bounces forth, and fiercely cries:\n'Shepherds, I am not given to scolding,\nBut now my spleen I cannot hold in.\nBy Jove, such scandalous oppression\nWould put an elephant in passion.\nYou, who your flocks (as you pretend)\nBy wholesome laws from harm defend,\nWhich make it death for any beast,\nHow much soe'er by hunger press'd,\nTo seize a sheep by force or stealth,\nFor sheep have right to life and health;\nCan you commit, uncheck'd by shame,\nWhat in a beast so much you blame?\nWhat is a law, if those who make it\nBecome the forwardest to break it?\nThe case is plain: you would reserve\nAll to yourselves, while others starve.\nSuch laws from base self-interest spring,\nNot from the reason of the thing\u2014'\nHe was proceeding, when a swain\nBurst out,\u2014'And dares a wolf arraign\nHis betters, and condemn their measures,\nAnd contradict their wills and pleasures?\nWe have establish'd laws, 'tis true,\nBut laws are made for such as you.\nKnow, sirrah, in its very nature\nA law can't reach the legislature.\nFor laws, without a sanction join'd,\nAs all men know, can never bind;\nBut sanctions reach not us the makers,\nFor who dares punish us, though breakers?\n'Tis therefore plain, beyond denial,\nThat laws were ne'er design'd to tie all;\nBut those, whom sanctions reach alone:\nWe stand accountable to none.\nBesides, 'tis evident, that, seeing\nLaws from the great derive their being,\nThey as in duty bound should love\nThe great, in whom they live and move,\nAnd humbly yield to their desires:\n'Tis just what gratitude requires.\nWhat suckling, dandled on the lap,\nWould tear away its mother's pap?\nBut hold\u2014Why deign I to dispute\nWith such a scoundrel of a brute?\nLogic is lost upon a knave,\nLet action prove the law our slave.'\nAn angry nod his will declared\nTo his gruff yeoman of the guard;\nThe full-fed mongrels, train'd to ravage,\nFly to devour the shaggy savage.\nThe beast had now no time to lose\nIn chopping logic with his foes;\n'This argument,' quoth he, 'has force,\nAnd swiftness is my sole resource.'\nHe said, and left the swains their prey,\nAnd to the mountains scour'd away."}
