{"subject": "MY ONLY VALENTINE", "text": "Your voice on the telephone\n\nHushes the storm in my heart\n\nLightning strikes twice\n\nIn the same place.\n\nI cannot picture your face\n\nNo photograph, no keepsake,\n\nNo letters scented with your smile,\n\nNo ring or marriage bed.\n\nYour kisses were the best\n\nI ever had, my first,\n\nMy only valentine."}
