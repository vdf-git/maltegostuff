{"subject": "I Am Offering This Poem", "text": "I am offering this poem to you,\nsince I have nothing else to give.\nKeep it like a warm coat,\nwhen winter comes to cover you,\nor like a pair of thick socks\nthe cold cannot bite through,\n\nI love you,\n\nI have nothing else to give you,\nso it is a pot full of yellow corn\nto warm your belly in the winter,\nit is a scarf for your head, to wear\nover your hair, to tie up around your face,\n\nI love you,\n\nKeep it, treasure it as you would\nif you were lost, needing direction,\nin the wilderness life becomes when mature;\nand in the corner of your drawer,\ntucked away like a cabin or a hogan\nin dense trees, come knocking,\nand I will answer, give you directions,\nand let you warm yourself by this fire,\nrest by this fire, and make you feel safe,\n\nI love you,\n\nIt's all I have to give,\nand it's all anyone needs to live,\nand to go on living inside,\nwhen the world outside\nno longer cares if you live or die;\nremember,\n\nI love you."}
