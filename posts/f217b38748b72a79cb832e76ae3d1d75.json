{"subject": "Homeric Interim", "text": "Distance is money just out of reach,\na kindness like rain-laden clouds\nthat never drops its coins. Epochs\nof fossilized trees crawl rusting hillside\nstrata: they smell like somewhere else\nI've never been, an Anatolia\njust outside the mind. Geometries\nof travel and desire (from here to want\nand back again), the myths of pleasure\nreinvent another ancient world: oiled boys\nracing naked around the circular walls\nof Troy to find out who will wear\nthe plaited wreath, parade painted circuits\nof unburnt parapets waving\nto the crowds. See, even night\nadores him, dresses him in its moon\nand apparition. The sheen of intention\nis on him, translates his motions\ninto marble, alabaster. (Cassandra\nwakes and says There isn't going to be\na Trojan war. Centuries of fossil speech\nfill up the space that comes after\ncurrently, years spent talking\nto paper.) Man and moment\nbecome one, his reliquary skin\nmakes white occur (by now\nthe sweat has faded from his garish\ndetails). The things his hands become\nact out interruption, history\nis his story, held at bay. He wears time\non his body (wears it out), chases gods\nfrom mountaintops until the myth-smoke\nclears. His old world's blurred\nand hard to read, misunderstanding\nbecomes a place: galley\nrun aground on shallow skin\nthe color of no event."}
