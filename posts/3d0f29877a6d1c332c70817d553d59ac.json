{"subject": "Sonnet Ccxlvii:", "text": "Love is the source of all my griefs, 'tis true, \nBut 'tis the source of all my joys as well; \nI would not break the glamor of its spell, \nTo reign the master of this mortal crew. \nMy joyous seasons have been brief and few; \nNor can I reckon up the days that tell \nMy many sorrows, nor the cares that dwell \nHere at a heart long banished from thy view. \nThis is my comfort: every grief or joy \nThat rules today, and every hope I see \nSmile through the gloom of boding destiny-- \nEach thought, sense, memory--aye, the flimsy toy \nMy fancy plays with, childlike, to destroy-- \nAll we call life, I owe alone to thee."}
