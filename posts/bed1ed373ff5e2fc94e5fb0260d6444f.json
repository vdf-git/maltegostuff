{"subject": "Your letter", "text": "your letter is larger and lighter \nthan the thought of a flower when the dream \nis a garden\u2014 \n\nas your letter opens \nthere's an unfolding of sky, word from outside, \nwide spaces \n\nI slept in green pastures, \nI lay on the cusp of the valley of the shadow of death \nduring the last watch of the night \nlistening to those condemned to die \nbeing led through tunnels in the earth, \n\nhow they sing \nwith the breath at their lips \nas residents at the point of leaving \na city in flames, how they sing, \ntheir breaths like shackles, \n\nhow they sing\u2014 \nthey who are about to jump from light into darkness, \nthey who will be posted to no destination\u2014 \nterror fills me at the desecration \n\nthe table before me in the presence of my enemies \nis bare, I have ash on my head, \nmy cup is empty \n\nand I fled to your letter to read \nof the orange tree decked out in white blossoms \nopening with the sun, \n\nI could smell it on the balcony\u2014 \nI can smell you \nlovelier and lighter than the thought of a flower \nin this dismal night \n\nI will be suspended from the sky of your words\u2014 \ngrant that I may dwell in your letter \nall the days of my life \n\nenvoi \nyour letter is wonderful, larger and lighter \nthan the thought of a flower when the dream \nis the earth of a garden\u2014 \n\nas your letter opens \nthere's an unfolding of sky, word from outside, \nmemory"}
