{"subject": "Mud On My Hands", "text": "Green eyes in the crevices of rocks\nwill not let the fossil weep\nfor innocent sun.\nA mayfly floats like\na dry leaf on water, in the circuit\nof sharks.\n\nI offer not my robotic arm, insulting\nthe jaws in the crumpled solitude\nof night. I will walk\nwith new moon to understand\nthe wetting of a bleeder, \nheart and soul.\n\nThe umbilical pain again catches. I cry\nin my own silence. This was not the\nend I wished. Hearing aid\nto feel the sting of a scream, \nwhich rises from the depth of a blue\nlake wounded by pride."}
