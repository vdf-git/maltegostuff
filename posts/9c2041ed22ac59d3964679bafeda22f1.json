{"subject": "The Town Witch", "text": "Crab-Faced, crab-tongued, with deep-set eyes that glared,\nUnfriendly and unfriended lived the crone\nUpon the common in her hut, alone,\nPast which but seldom any villager fared.\nSome said she was a witch and rode, wild-haired,\nTo devils' revels: on her hearth's rough stone\nA fiend sat ever with gaunt eyes that shone\nA shaggy hound whose fangs at all were bared.\nSo one day, when a neighbour's cow had died\nAnd some one's infant sickened, good men shut\nThe crone in prison: dragged to court and tried:\nThen hung her for a witch and burnt her hut.\nDays after, on her grave, all skin and bones\nThey found the dog, and him they killed with stones."}
