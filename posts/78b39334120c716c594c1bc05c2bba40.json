{"subject": "The Faith Of Old George Jones", "text": "War raged around this troubled world,\n When I was but a lad,\nAnd into battle men were hurled,\nAs some ambition mad\nMoved kings on their unstable thrones\nTo bring the world unease.\nMad days, I'll grant (said old George Jones),\nBut not as mad as these.\n\nThey fought for power, fought for gain,\nFor land and plunder then;\nThey fought for ends that they made plain\nAnd understood of men.\nBut in this strangely restless age,\nAnd this world's changing scene,\nMen fight and die while nations rage,\n For visions half unseen.\n\nThey fight for theories untried,\nIdeals, untested creeds,\nAnd seek their ends thro' fratricide,\nWhile hate's rank passion breeds.\nOn this red soil . . . Must I, a man\nUnlettered, pierce the mist,\nAnd bind myself so to some strange plan \nFascist or Socialist?\n\nI am a man.  It is enough.\nI ply a peaceful trade.\nWhat should I know of this queer stuff\nOf which their dreams are made?\nSmall is the wisdom mankind owns,\nBut, as his knowledge grows,\nIt seems to me (said old George Jones),\nHis hard-won wisdom goes."}
