{"subject": "Remembrance", "text": "How dear to me the twilight hour!\nIt breathes, it speaks of pleasures past;\nWhen Laura sought this humble bower,\nAnd o'er it courtly splendours cast.\n\nFond fancy's friend, dim twilight, hail!\nThou canst the absent nymph restore;\nAnd as around thy shadows sail,\nThey bring the form I still adore.\n\nAgain her pensive smile I view,\nHer modest eye's soft chastened fire;\nAnd mark her cheek of tender hue\nFrom thee a softer tint acquire.\n\nNo eye but mine in that dim hour\nThe softly blushing maid could see;\nAnd then her voice of magic power\nCharmed with its sweetness none but me.\n\nBut now, alas! to distant plains,\nTo crowded scenes, perhaps, she flies;\nShe speaks, to charm unnumbered swains;\nShe smiles, to bless unnumbered eyes.\n\nYet if, while crowds before thee bow,\nThy lips to favouring smiles incline,\nThink not, sweet maid, their bosoms glow\nWith love as pure, as true as mine.\n\nReflect,....I knelt before thy feet,\nAfraid to speak, or look, or move,\nNor e'en thy pity dared entreat\nFor hours of hopeless pining love.\n\nThey can with bold unfaltering tongue\nTheir loudly-boasted flame reveal;\nBut, Laura, spurn the heartless throng,\nThey talk of pangs I only feel .\n\nFrom glowing cheeks, and sparkling eyes,\nO turn, my Laura! turn to him\nFrom whose sunk cheek the colour flies,\nWhose eye with hopeless love is dim.\n\nO turn to me, whose blighted youth\nThe wreck of former days appears!....\nBut well the change has proved my truth,\nAnd thou wilt own that change endears.\n\nYet, no; ah, no! forget, forget\nMy ardent love, my faith, and me;\nRemember not we ever met;\nI would not cause one pang to thee.\n\nAnd when I hear that thou art blest,\nMy own distress I'll learn to scorn;\nI'll bid imperious anguish rest,\nWhile smiles my pallid lips adorn.\n\nDeep in my heart the load of grief,\nConcealed from every glance, shall lie;\nTill sorrow proves its own relief,\nAnd I shall suffer, smile, and die."}
