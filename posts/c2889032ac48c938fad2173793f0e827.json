{"subject": "An Anacreontick", "text": "Busy, curious, thirsty Fly, \nGently drink, and drink as I; \nFreely welcome to my Cup, \nCould'st thou sip, and sip it up; \nMake the most of Life you may, \nLife is short and wears away. \n\nJust alike, both mine and thine, \nHasten quick to their Decline; \nThine's a Summer, mine's no more, \nThough repeated to threescore; \nThreescore Summers when they're gone, \nWill appear as short as one."}
