{"subject": "The Right Road", "text": "Let the feeble-hearted pine,\nLet the sickly spirit whine,\nBut work and win be thine,\nWhile you've life.\nGod smiles upon the bold\nSo, when your flag's unrolled,\nBear it bravely till you're cold\nIn the strife.\n\nIf to rank or fame you soar,\nOut your spirit frankly pour-\nMen will serve you and adore,\nLike a king.\nWoo your girl with honest pride,\nTill you've won her for your bride-\nThen to her, through time and tide,\nEver cling.\n\nNever under wrongs despair; \nLabour long, and everywhere,\nLink your countrymen, prepare,\nAnd strike home.\nThus have great men ever wrought,\nThus must greatness still be sought,\nThus laboured, loved, and fought\nGreece and Rome."}
