{"subject": "First Ever Poem", "text": "Today\u2019s the day where I sit and pray and hope you\u2019ll come back to live another day\nI no I\u2019ve not meet you be needless to say, you mean a lot to me in every possible way.\nIt\u2019s been 4weeks and I hardly heard a peak until tonight when you tell me you\u2019re off in a week \nYou tell me you have to, you tell me you\u2019re sorry, you tell me not even to worry. \nYou tell me this is your last goodbye, you tell me not cry.\nI tell you I love you, I tell you I care, I tell I\u2019ll always be here\nI hope you come back not even for me but just for your family so they don\u2019t have to grieve."}
