{"subject": "The Chapel In Lyonesse", "text": "SIR OZANA.\n\nAll day long and every day,\nFrom Christmas-Eve to Whit-Sunday,\nWithin that Chapel-aisle I lay,\nAnd no man came a-near.\n\nNaked to the waist was I,\nAnd deep within my breast did lie,\nThough no man any blood could spy,\nThe truncheon of a spear.\n\nNo meat did ever pass my lips\nThose days. Alas! the sunlight slips\nFrom off the gilded parclose, dips,\nAnd night comes on apace.\n\nMy arms lay back behind my head;\nOver my raised-up knees was spread\nA samite cloth of white and red;\nA rose lay on my face.\n\nMany a time I tried to shout;\nBut as in dream of battle-rout,\nMy frozen speech would not well out;\nI could not even weep.\n\nWith inward sigh I see the sun\nFade off the pillars one by one,\nMy heart faints when the day is done,\nBecause I cannot sleep.\n\nSometimes strange thoughts pass through my head;\nNot like a tomb is this my bed,\nYet oft I think that I am dead;\nThat round my tomb is writ,\n\n\"Ozana of the hardy heart,\nKnight of the Table Round,\nPray for his soul, lords, of your part;\nA true knight he was found.\"\n\nAh! me, I cannot fathom it.\n\n\nSIR GALAHAD.\n\nAll day long and every day,\nTill his madness pass'd away,\nI watch'd Ozana as he lay\nWithin the gilded screen.\n\nAll my singing moved him not;\nAs I sung my heart grew hot,\nWith the thought of Launcelot\nFar away, I ween.\n\nSo I went a little space\nFrom out the chapel, bathed my face\nIn the stream that runs apace\nBy the churchyard wall.\n\nThere I pluck'd a faint wild rose,\nHard by where the linden grows,\nSighing over silver rows\nOf the lilies tall.\n\nI laid the flower across his mouth;\nThe sparkling drops seem'd good for drouth;\nHe smiled, turn'd round towards the south,\nHeld up a golden tress.\n\nThe light smote on it from the west;\nHe drew the covering from his breast,\nAgainst his heart that hair he prest;\nDeath him soon will bless.\nSIR BORS.\n\nI enter'd by the western door;\nI saw a knight's helm lying there:\nI raised my eyes from off the floor,\nAnd caught the gleaming of his hair.\n\nI stept full softly up to him;\nI laid my chin upon his head;\nI felt him smile; my eyes did swim,\nI was so glad he was not dead.\n\nI heard Ozana murmur low,\n\"There comes no sleep nor any love.\"\nBut Galahad stoop'd and kiss'd his brow:\nHe shiver'd; I saw his pale lips move.\nSIR OZANA.\n\nThere comes no sleep nor any love;\nAh me! I shiver with delight.\nI am so weak I cannot move;\nGod move me to thee, dear, to-night!\nChrist help! I have but little wit:\nMy life went wrong; I see it writ,\n\n\"Ozana of the hardy heart,\nKnight of the Table Round,\nPray for his soul, lords, on your part;\nA good knight he was found.\"\n\nNow I begin to fathom it.\n\n\nSIR BORS.\n\nGalahad sits dreamily;\nWhat strange things may his eyes see,\nGreat blue eyes fix'd full on me?\nOn his soul, Lord, have mercy.\nSIR GALAHAD.\n\nOzana, shall I pray for thee?\nHer cheek is laid to thine;\nNo long time hence, also I see\nThy wasted fingers twine\n\nWithin the tresses of her hair\nThat shineth gloriously,\nThinly outspread in the clear air\nAgainst the jasper sea."}
