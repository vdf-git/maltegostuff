{"subject": "After Autumn Rain", "text": "The hillside smokes\nWith trailing mist around the rosy oaks;\nWhile sunset builds\nA gorgeous Asia in the west she gilds.\nAuroral streaks\nSword through the heavens' Himalayan peaks:\nIn which, behold,\nBurn mines of Indian ruby and of gold.\nA moment and\nA shadow stalks between it and the land.\nA mist, a breath,\nA premonition, with the face of death,\nTurning to frost\nThe air it breathes, like some invisible ghost.\nThen, wild of hair,\nDemons seem streaming to their fiery lair:\nA chasm, the same\nThat splits the clouds' face with a leer of flame.\nThe wind comes up\nAnd fills the hollow land as wine a cup.\nAround and round\nIt skips the dead leaves o'er the forest's ground.\nA myriad fays\nAnd imps seem dancing down the withered ways.\nAnd far and near\nIt makes of every bush a whisperer;\nTelling dark tales\nOf things that happened in the ghostly vales:\nOf things the fox\nBarks at and sees among the haunted rocks:\nAt which the owl\nHoots, and the wolf-hound cringes with a growl.\nNow on the road\nIt walks like feet too weary for their load.\nShuffling the leaves,\nWith stormy sighs, onward it plods and heaves;\nTill in the hills\nAmong the red death there itself it kills.\nAnd with its death\nEarth, so its seems, draws in a mighty breath.\nAnd, like a clown\nWho wanders lost upon a haunted down,\nTurns towards the east,\nFearful of coming goblin or of beast,\nAnd sees a light,\nThe jack-o'-lantern moon, glow into sight.."}
