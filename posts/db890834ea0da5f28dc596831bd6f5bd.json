{"subject": "The Woman", "text": "After the birds have winged away, their smudges remain on swaying branches \nforming green droplets \nas sprouting leaves from claw-marks\nand mellowing fruits get impregnated with sweetness, with the scratch of chirping.\nThe woman too sits, likewise, on the crest of the house\nand disappears all of a sudden as if reminded of something\n\nHolding a broom or clothes to be squeezed\nOr sporting on her fingertips the flavor of asafetida \nor the wetness of a baby's napkin-diaper changed a while ago .\nHer eyes keep favouring you for the lifetime.\nAnd her feet?- the earth, that is, the sky.\n\nAs she enters the home, she is a bird\nbut the moment her scrawny legs touch the earth,\nthey behave in a way so weird,\nastonishing the whole neighborhood of trees and birds :\nshe stands at the threshold like a freshly planted sapling in a flower-bed,\nhalfway thru' unfamiliarity and intimacy.\n\nHer legs start taking roots in the corridor, in the sadness of the backyard\nin the age-old account-book, in your glad thighs and gloomy heart. \nNow onwards neither can birds fly nor can the trees stand still, never ever.\nBoth, the birdbath and the flower-bed would be brimming now onwards, with aridity.\n\nEven while serving lunar porridge in your bronze-bowl \nshe keeps retreating, step by step, towards crematorium:\nshe, - the ashen wrinkly great grandma, grandma, or mom, \n- yours or your kids'.\n\nThe bird becomes\ncousin of the Arundhati star1 deep rooted in the sky.\nEven after that, pervade the entire household\nthe aroma of sweet dishes, play-full cries of kids and homely incantations of \nconstellations \non the day of shraddh.\nIn the waddle of expecting women-folk \none finds lightness of birds and heaviness of laden trees\nand thus the home follows in the footsteps of life.\n\nAlthough its prints can't be traced on the floor of the house.\n\nTranslation: Dr. Piyush Joshi and Dr. Rajendrasinh Jadeja"}
