{"subject": "Ode V. To Sylvia", "text": "Hast thou not seen some captive bird\nImpatient flit within the wire,\nAnd seek the bliss of liberty,\nWith anxious fond desire?\n\nOr hast thou not beheld, in chains,\nSome poor unhappy pris'ner pine?\nE'en such a wretched slave am I,\nE'en such hard fetters mine.\n\nBut yet from these I differ too,\nFor they would cast their chains away,\nWhile I exult to wear the badge\nOf thy unpitying sway.\nThen deign, fair nymph, one smile of love,\nOne ray of ruddy hope impart!\nO, give this life the pow'r to live,\nAnd heal the wounded heart!"}
