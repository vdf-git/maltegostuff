{"subject": "Apple-Blossoms", "text": "LET men remember, when they pray, \nThe rose and silver dawns of May, \nMost palely, spiritually gray; \n\nThe sky above the blossomed trees, \nPale as December Arctic seas, \nPure as the white anemones. \n\nOn such a morning, lightly swung \nBy the chance song a bluebird sung, \nThe silence like an incense hung. \n\nA rod away, you'd scarcely know \nIf these were apple-blooms ablow \nOr a reverted April snow; \n\nBut over all the sentient earth \nYoung lantern-leaves, for joy of birth, \nHung out the saffron hues of mirth. \n\nThe honeysucker wove his loom \nOf busy noise from plume to plume \nOf rosy-clustered apple-bloom. \n\nWent by the bee; the butterfly \nOn soft and papery wings went by, \nBeneath his low, sufficient sky. \n\nAnd on a sudden flaw and swell, \nIf 't were a petal white that fell, \nOr a blown moth, you 'd hardly tell, \n\nSo soft the air, so hung with scents \nThat fell from these whites flowery tents \nOn odorous beds of innocents. \n\nThe church bells, by the distance drowned, \nCame to me like the ghost of sound, \nSoft-choired with birds that sang around; \n\nAnd dim as distance were the blue \nSlopes, and the hills I thought I knew, \nBehind the mist, and shining through."}
