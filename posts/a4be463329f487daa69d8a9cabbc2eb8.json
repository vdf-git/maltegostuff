{"subject": "The Eternal City", "text": "Sometimes I picture your face on money. \n\nBut this isn't Rome, where they know\nwhat money's worth, which is almost \n\nthe paper it's printed on (a kind of art), \n\nand where I stared what seemed eternity\ninto a guidebook, lost, side-skipping\n\npigeon past, motorbikes, and swarms \n\nof gypsy tykes excavating the ruins\nof tourists' pockets, until I stumbled\n\nonto the Temple of the Golden Arches-\n\nMcDonald's!- and across the piazza, \nthe Pantheon.... Inside, third niche left, \n\nalone a moment with the Ossa et cineres\n\nof Raphael, I thought of you; \"put it all\nin the poem\" was your advice so, okay, \n\nhere you are! - among the camcorders, \n\ncell phones, retired gods, and a pair of\nkings - rumpled, broke, and amused \n\nas you were the Green Mountain morning\n\nyou asked: among us who was writing \nfor posterity?, and one of us knew. Bill, \n\nI haven't paid you your due, but need\n\nanother favor: could you please undie\nso I can buy you the glass of good\n\nrosso in the Eternal City I owe you? \n\n               William Matthews, poet and teacher (1942 - 1997)"}
