{"subject": "The Call", "text": "Across the dusty, foot-worn street\nUnblessed of flower or tree,\nFaint and far-off--there ever sounds\nThe calling of the sea.\n\nFrom out the quiet of the hills,\nWhere purple shadows lie,\nThe pine trees murmur, 'Come and rest\nAnd let the world go by.'\n\nThe west wind whispers all night long\n'Oh, journey forth afar\nTo the green and pleasant places\nWhere little rivers are!'\n\nAnd the soft and silken rustling\nOf bending yellow wheat\nSays, 'See the harvest moon--that dims\nThe arc-lights of the street.'\n\nThough the city holds thee captive\nBy trick, and wile, and lure,\nOut yonder lies the loveliness\nOf things that shall endure.\n\nThe river road is wide and fair,\nThe prairie-path is free,\nAnd still the old earth waits to give\nHer strength and joy to thee."}
