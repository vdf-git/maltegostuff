{"subject": "Harlie", "text": "Fold the little waxen hands\nLightly. Let your warmest tears\nSpeak regrets, but never fears,--\nHeaven understands!\nLet the sad heart, o'er the tomb,\nLift again and burst in bloom\nFragrant with a prayer as sweet\nAs the lily at your feet.\n\nBend and kiss the folded eyes--\nThey are only feigning sleep\nWhile their truant glances peep\nInto Paradise.\nSee, the face, though cold and white,\nHolds a hint of some delight\nE'en with Death, whose finger-tips\nRest upon the frozen lips.\n\nWhen, within the years to come,\nVanished echoes live once more--\nPattering footsteps on the floor,\nAnd the sounds of home,--\nLet your arms in fancy fold\nLittle Harlie as of old--\nAs of old and as he waits\nAt the City's golden gates."}
