{"subject": "Seven Birds", "text": "A white Bird\nA breath condenses\nEven density can be pleasant\nEach wall widens its cracks\nAnd retains the call\nA height that remains a height\nSprings that have gathered the winds of the fields\n\nA Red Bird\nIt may have travelled the river in one night\nThe road may have guided it through the upper layers\nI ponder the mystery of its redness\nThen forget the sky\nThat has taken it\nThere\n\nA Green Bird\n\nThere are sleeping feathers before me\nFeathers that blast me with the fire of distance\nAnd feathers without a body that bend\nAnd collect\nIn a point\nBetween us speech is fluttering\n\nA Blue Bird\n\nSo drunk in the evening it's almost unable to return\nIt would prefer that departure go on\nWithout departure\nReflections\nOf light in the pool\nGrow longer\n\nA Black Bird\nEach thing wants to emulate it\nWater in the pots\nWords on their birthdays\nCaravans across borders\nA girl not yet wet with dew\n\nBut the thrush\nEmulates only\nItself\nIt stays on branches of joy\nA Yellow Bird\nThat window remains open for it\n as they sit face to face and\n the bird stays because of\n an approaching silence until \nwithout even pecking the grains it\n soars just as its past did just as\n its future will at dawn\nA Colorless Bird\nElated it chirps on one of the nights of solitude\nBefore it flies\nWhere light unites with vibration\nA draft that startles\nIts visitor with a wing whose recurrent glitter\nIs ever-changing and I can see it from a distance\nIt flies\nSo that what I see\nIs this thing that resembles nothing distant\n\nTranslated by Fady Joudah"}
