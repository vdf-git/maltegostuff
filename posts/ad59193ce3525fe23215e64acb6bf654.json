{"subject": "A Thought Of Burns", "text": "Large was his heart, and deep and strong \nThe human love within it; \nAs free and musical its song \nAs wood-notes of the linnet. \n\nNo touch of art more fresh and clear \nThe warbling tones could render; \nNo paean make his name more dear, \nHis, memory more tender. \n\nHe sought not with impatient feet \nThe path to glory's portal; \nAnd yet his simple words and sweet \nAre fame-lit and immortal. \n\nHis 'Highland Mary' still shall haunt \nThe dells by burn and river, \nAnd ' Bonnie Doon ' as sweetly chant \nLove's melody for ever. \n\nThe mountain daisy and the song \nHis plough upturned together, \nShall blossom in the heart as long \nAs blooms his native heather."}
