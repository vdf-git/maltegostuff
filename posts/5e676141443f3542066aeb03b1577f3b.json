{"subject": "Star Crossed Lovers", "text": "What tangled webs we weave of lies and deception.\nWhen it starts as friends and turning into star crossed lovers.\nThe truth only to be sought in true loves embrace. \nDefying all odds and searching out others trying to forget what is demand of us, and realizing that true happiness is in the arms of the other. \nDefying all odds and rushing into the embrace not caring what comes in the future only living for that moment in time. \nLovers are met and lost but true love never dominates it flourishes with your one true love.\n (C)  2010 RLW"}
