{"subject": "A Challenge", "text": "A bull imprisoned in a stall\nBroke boldly the confining wall,\nAnd found himself, when out of bounds,\nWithin a washerwoman's grounds.\nWhere, hanging on a line to dry,\nA crimson skirt inflamed his eye.\nWith bellowings that woke the dead,\nHe bent his formidable head,\nWith pointed horns and gnarly forehead;\nThen, planting firm his shoulders horrid,\nBegan, with rage made half insane,\nTo paw the arid earth amain,\nFlinging the dust upon his flanks\nIn desolating clouds and banks,\nThe while his eyes' uneasy white\nBetrayed his doubt what foe the bright\nRed tent concealed, perchance, from sight.\nThe garment, which, all undismayed,\nHad never paled a single shade,\nNow found a tongue-a dangling sock,\nLeft carelessly inside the smock:\n'I must insist, my gracious liege,\nThat you'll be pleased to raise the siege:\nMy colors I will never strike.\nI know your sex-you're all alike.\nSome small experience I've had\nYou're not the first I've driven mad.'"}
