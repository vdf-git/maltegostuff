{"subject": "The Nightingale", "text": "The nightingale, as soon as April bringeth \nUnto her rested sense a perfect waking, \nWhile late bare earth, proud of new clothing, springeth, \nSings out her woes, a thorn her song-book making, \nAnd mournfully bewailing, \nHer throat in tunes expresseth \nWhat grief her breast oppresseth \nFor Tereus' force on her chaste will prevailing. \nO Philomela fair, O take some gladness, \nThat here is juster cause of plaintful sadness: \nThine earth now springs, mine fadeth; \nThy thorn without, my thorn my heart invadeth. \n\nAlas, she hath no other cause of anguish \nBut Tereus' love, on her by strong hand wroken, \nWherein she suffering, all her spirits languish; \nFull womanlike complains her will was broken. \nBut I, who daily craving, \nCannot have to content me, \nHave more cause to lament me, \nSince wanting is more woe than too much having. \nO Philomela fair, O take some gladness, \nThat here is juster cause of plaintful sadness: \nThine earth now springs, mine fadeth; \nThy thorn without, my thorn my heart invadeth."}
