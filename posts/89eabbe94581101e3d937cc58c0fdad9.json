{"subject": "Ripley", "text": "Rich in red honors, that upon him lie\nAs lightly as the Summer dews\nFall where he won his fame beneath the sky\nOf tropic Vera Cruz;\n\nBold scorner of the cant that has its birth\nIn feeble or in failing powers;\nA lover of all frank and genial mirth\nThat wreathes the sword with flowers;\n\nHe moves amid the warriors of the day,\nJust such a soldier as the art\nThat builds its trophies upon human clay\nMoulds of a cheerful heart.\n\nI see him in the battle that shall shake,\nEre long, old Sumter's haughty crown,\nAnd from their dreams of peaceful traffic wake\nThe wharves of yonder town;\n\nAs calm as one would greet a pleasant guest,\nAnd quaff a cup to love and life,\nHe hurls his deadliest thunders with a jest,\nAnd laughs amid the strife.\n\nYet not the gravest soldier of them all\nSurveys a field with broader scope;\nAnd who behind that sea-encircled wall\nFights with a loftier hope?\n\nGay Chieftain! on the crimson rolls of Fame\nThy deeds are written with the sword;\nBut there are gentler thoughts which, with thy name,\nThy country's page shall hoard.\n\nA nature of that rare and happy cast\nWhich looks, unsteeled, on murder's face;\nThrough what dark scenes of bloodshed hast thou passed,\nYet lost no social grace?\n\nSo, when the bard depicts thee, thou shalt wield\nThe weapon of a tyrant's doom,\nRound which, inscribed with many a well-fought field,\nThe rose of joy shall bloom."}
