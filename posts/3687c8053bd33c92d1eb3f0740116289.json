{"subject": "The Abominable Sin", "text": "I turn on my T.V. Lord what did I see \n White teens beat a black boy I think it was three \n Where God did they learn such a terrible abominable hate \n They were taught by their parents to unlearn it's too late \n The young black boy's in the hospital wondering why \n He was beaten and stumped then left to die \n All because of his color God gave him that skin \n The bigots don't believe it that's why they beat him \n I wonder what they will tell God when Death them do claim \n I was taught by my parents let them take the blame \n Can't you see God is not pleased with man's inhumanity to man \n White and Black must in unity take a powerful stand \n We can't let prejudice and hate ruin America land of the free \n We must find love for each other and stand in unity \n No more Whites against Blacks, No Black against White \n We will all get along with love doing what's right \n For God made us all and we must believe and ensure \n That Freedom's for all and it will endure"}
