{"subject": "Elizabeth At Tilbury", "text": "September: 1588\n\nLet them come, come never so proudly,\nO'er the green waves as giants ride;\nSilver clarions menacing loudly,\n'All the Spains' on their banners wide;\nHigh on deck of the gilded galleys\nOur light sailers they scorn below:--\nWe will scatter them, plague, and shatter them,\nTill their flag hauls down to their foe!\nFor our oath we swear\nBy the name we bear,\nBy England's Queen, and England free and fair,--\nHer's ever and her's still, come life, come death:--\nGod save Elizabeth!\n\nSidonia, Recalde, and Leyva\nWatch from their Castles in swarthy scorn,\nLords and Princes by Philip's favour;--\nWe by birthright are noble born!\nFreemen born of the blood of freemen,\nSons of Crecy and Flodden are we!\nWe shall sunder them, fire, and plunder them,--\nEnglish boats on an English sea!\nAnd our oath we swear,\nBy the name we bear,\nBy England's Queen, and England free and fair,--\nHer's ever and her's still, come life, come death!\nGod save Elizabeth!\n\nDrake and Frobisher, Hawkins, and Howard,\nRaleigh, Cavendish, Cecil, and Brooke,\nHang like wasps by the flagships tower'd,\nSting their way through the thrice-piled oak:--\nLet them range their seven-mile crescent,\nGiant galleons, canvas wide!\nOurs will harry them, board, and carry them,\nPlucking the plumes of the Spanish pride.\nFor our oath we swear\nBy the name we bear,\nBy England's Queen, and England free and fair,--\nHer's ever and her's still, come life, come death!\nGod save Elizabeth!\n\n--Hath God risen in wrath and scatter'd?\nHave His tempests smote them in scorn?\nPast the Orcades, dumb and tatter'd,\n'Mong sea-beasts do they drift forlorn?\nWe were as lions hungry for battle;\nGod has made our battle His own!\nGod has scatter'd them, sunk, and shatter'd them:\nGive the glory to Him alone!\nWhile our oath we swear,\nBy the name we bear,\nBy England's Queen, and England free and fair,--\nHer's ever and her's still, come life, come death!\nGod save Elizabeth!"}
