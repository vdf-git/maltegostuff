{"subject": "Sonnet 100: Where Art Thou, Muse, That Thou Forget'st So Long", "text": "Where art thou, Muse, that thou forget'st so long\nTo speak of that which gives thee all thy might?\nSpend'st thou thy fury on some worthless song,\nDarkening thy power to lend base subjects light?\nReturn, forgetful Muse, and straight redeem\nIn gentle numbers time so idly spent;\nSing to the ear that doth thy lays esteem,\nAnd gives thy pen both skill and argument.\nRise, resty Muse, my love's sweet face survey\nIf time have any wrinkle graven there;\nIf any, be a satire to decay,\nAnd make time's spoils despis\u00e8d everywhere.\n    Give my love fame faster than Time wastes life;\n    So thou prevent'st his scythe and crooked knife."}
