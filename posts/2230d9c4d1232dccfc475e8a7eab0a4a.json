{"subject": "Sonnet. Written In Disgust Of Vulgar Superstition", "text": "The church bells toll a melancholy round,\nCalling the people to some other prayers,\nSome other gloominess, more dreadful cares,\nMore hearkening to the sermon's horrid sound.\nSurely the mind of man is closely bound\nIn some black spell; seeing that each one tears\nHimself from fireside joys, and Lydian airs,\nAnd converse high of those with glory crown'd.\nStill, still they toll, and I should feel a damp,--\nA chill as from a tomb, did I not know\nThat they are dying like an outburnt lamp;\nThat 'tis their sighing, wailing ere they go\nInto oblivion; -- that fresh flowers will grow,\nAnd many glories of immortal stamp."}
