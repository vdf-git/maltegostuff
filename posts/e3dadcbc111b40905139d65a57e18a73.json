{"subject": "A 'Mass' Meeting", "text": "It was a solemn rite as e'er\nWas seen by mortal man.\nThe celebrants, the people there,\nWere all Republican.\n\nThere Estee bent his grizzled head,\nAnd General Dimond, too,\nAnd one-'twas Reddick, some one said,\nThough no one clearly knew.\n\nI saw the priest, white-robed and tall\n(Assistant, Father Stow)-\nHe was the pious man men call\nDan Burns of Mexico.\n\nAh, 'twas a high and holy rite\nAs any one could swear.\n'What does it mean?' I asked a wight\nWho knelt apart in prayer.\n\n'A mass for the repose,' he said,\n'Of Colonel Markham's'--'What,\nIs gallant Colonel Markham dead?\n'Tis sad, 'tis sad, God wot!'\n\n'A mass'-repeated he, and rose\nTo go and kneel among\nThe worshipers-'for the repose\nOf Colonel Markham's tongue.'"}
