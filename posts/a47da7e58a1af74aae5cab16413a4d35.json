{"subject": "Ode To Memory", "text": "I.\nTHOU who stealest fire,\nFrom the fountains of the past,\nTo glorify the present, oh, haste,\nVisit my low desire!\nStrengthen me, enlighten me!\nI faint in this obscurity,\nThou dewy dawn of memory. \n\nII.\nCome not as thou camest of late,\nFlinging the gloom of yesternight\nOn the white day, but robed in soften\u2019d light\nOf orient state.\nWhilome thou camest with the morning mist,\nEven as a maid, whose stately brow\nThe dew-impearled winds of dawn have kiss\u2019d,\nWhen she, as thou,\nStays on her floating locks the lovely freight\nOf overflowing blooms, and earliest shoots\nOf orient green, giving safe pledge of fruits,\nWhich in wintertide shall star\nThe black earth with brilliance rare. \n\nIII.\nWhilome thou camest with the morning mist,\nAnd with the evening cloud,\nShowering thy gleaned wealth into my open breast;\nThose peerless flowers which in the rudest wind\nNever grow sere,\nWhen rooted in the garden of the mind,\nBecause they are the earliest of the year.\nNor was the night thy shroud.\nIn sweet dreams softer than unbroken rest\nThou leddest by the hand thine infant Hope.\nThe eddying of her garments caught from thee\nThe light of thy great presence; and the cope\nOf the half-attain\u2019d futurity,\nTho\u2019 deep not fathomless,\nWas cloven with the million stars which tremble\nO\u2019er the deep mind of dauntless infancy.\nSmall thought was there of life\u2019s distress;\nFor sure she deem\u2019d no mist of earth could dull\nThose spirit-thrilling eyes so keen and beautiful;\nSure she was nigher to heaven\u2019s spheres,\nListening the lordly music flowing from\nThe illimitable years.\nO strengthen me, enlighten me!\nI faint in this obscurity,\nThou dewy dawn of memory. \n\nIV.\nCome forth, I charge thee, arise,\nThou of the many tongues, the myriad eyes!\nThou comest not with shows of flaunting vines\nUnto mine inner eye,\nDivinest Memory!\nThou wert not nursed by the waterfall\nWhich ever sounds and shines\nA pillar of white light upon the wall\nOf purple cliffs, aloof descried:\nCome from the woods that belt the gray hillside,\nThe seven elms, the poplars four\nThat stand beside my father\u2019s door,\nAnd chiefly from the brook that loves\nTo purl o\u2019er matted cress and ribbed sand,\nOr dimple in the dark of rushy coves,\nDrawing into his narrow earthen urn,\nIn every elbow and turn,\nThe filter\u2019d tribute of the rough woodland;\nO! hither lead thy feet!\nPour round mine ears the livelong bleat\nOf the thick-fleeced sheep from wattled folds,\nUpon the ridged wolds,\nWhen the first matin-song hath waken\u2019d loud\nOver the dark dewy earth forlorn,\nWhat time the amber morn\nForth gushes from beneath a low-hung cloud. \n\nV.\nLarge dowries doth the raptured eye\nTo the young spirit present\nWhen first she is wed,\nAnd like a bride of old,\nIn triumph led,\nWith music and sweet showers\nOf festal flowers,\nUnto the dwelling she must sway.\nWell hast thou done, great artist Memory.\nIn setting round thy first experiment\nWith royal framework of wrought gold;\nNeeds must thou dearly love thy first essay,\nAnd foremost in thy various gallery\nPlace it, where sweetest sunlight falls\nUpon the storied walls;\nFor the discovery\nAnd newness of thine art so pleased thee,\nThat all which thou hast drawn of fairest\nOr boldest since but lightly weighs\nWith thee unto the love thou bearest\nThe first-born of thy genius. Artist-like,\nEver retiring thou dost gaze\nOn the prime labor of thine early days,\nNo matter what the sketch might be:\nWhether the high field on the bushless pike,\nOr even a sand-built ridge\nOf heaped hills that mound the sea,\nOverblown with murmurs harsh,\nOr even a lowly cottage whence we see\nStretch\u2019d wide and wild the waste enormous marsh,\nWhere from the frequent bridge,\nLike emblems of infinity,\nThe trenched waters run from sky to sky;\nOr a garden bower\u2019d close\nWith plaited alleys of the trailing rose,\nLong alleys falling down to twilight grots,\nOr opening upon level plots\nOf crowned lilies, standing near\nPurple-spiked lavender:\nWhither in after life retired\nFrom brawling storms,\nFrom weary wind,\nWith youthful fancy re-inspired,\nWe may hold converse with all forms\nOf the many-sided mind,\nAnd those whom passion hath not blinded,\nSubtle-thoughted, myriad-minded. \nMy friend, with you to live alone\nWere how much better than to own\nA crown, a sceptre, and a throne! \n\nO strengthen me, englighten me!\nI faint in this obscurity,\nThou dewy dawn of memory."}
