{"subject": "A Tender Touch.", "text": "For Aaron\nWho dares to judge the lonely, who dares to question their intention? \nWho dares to hold them in contempt, who dares to attempt intervention? \nThe combination, of empathy and care, holding firm their spiritual connection, \nA genuine sharing of eternal love and everlasting affection, \nA bond formed, in the depths of desperation, with nothing more than each other, \nThe love they share is deep, longing, not that of a mere temporary lover, \nA tender touch between two lost and lonely spirits, reassuring one another with the gentlest caring caress, \nTransforming fear, allaying loneliness and pain, pacifying insecurity, under extreme duress...\nHiding in each other\u2019s protective, secure, eternal embrace, \nFree to feel and love in this sacred, spiritual, place, \nSeeking asylum from their self inflicted torment, an invisible prison confining in eternal isolation, \nFeeling the loneliness associated with complete and unimaginable desolation....\nIn each other they trust and find solace enough to continue their journey through the ages, \nMethodically flipping through the days with little else, like a book with countless pages, \nNow they soar upon each other\u2019s wings higher, until the earth surrenders to darkness, \nFree at last to be themselves, in adoring company, so free and utterly self-less...\n\nWe construct our own prisons of pain......Reach out before it\u2019s too late.....someone is waiting for you somewhere....\n\nJanelle Sheridan\n(Sept.2010)"}
