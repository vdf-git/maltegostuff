{"subject": "The Grave Of A Poetess", "text": "I stood beside thy lowly grave; \nSpring-odours breath'd around, \nAnd music, in the river-wave, \nPass'd with a lulling sound. \n\nAll happy things that love the sun,\nIn the bright air glanc'd by, \nAnd a glad murmur seem'd to run \nThro' the soft azure sky. \n\nFresh leaves were on the ivy-bough \nThat fring'd the ruins near; \nYoung voices were abroad\u2013but thou \nTheir sweetness couldst not hear. \n\nAnd mournful grew my heart for thee,\nThou in whose woman's mind \nThe ray that brightens earth and sea, \nThe light of song was shrined. \n\nMournful, that thou wert slumbering low,\nWith a dread curtain drawn\nBetween thee and the golden glow\nOf this world's vernal dawn. \n\nParted from all the song and bloom\nThou wouldst have lov'd so well,\nTo thee the sunshine round thy tomb\nWas but a broken spell. \n\nThe bird, the insect on the wing,\nIn their bright reckless play,\nMight feel the flush and life of spring,\u2013\nAnd thou wert pass'd away! \n\nBut then, ev'n then, a nobler thought\nO'er my vain sadness came;\nTh' immortal spirit woke, and wrought\nWithin my thrilling frame. \n\nSurely on lovelier things, I said,\nThou must have look'd ere now,\nThan all that round our pathway shed\nOdours and hues below. \n\nThe shadows of the tomb are here,\nYet beautiful is earth!\nWhat see'st thou then where no dim fear,\nNo haunting dream hath birth? \n\nHere a vain love to passing flowers\nThou gav'st\u2013but where thou art,\nThe sway is not with changeful hours,\nThere love and death must part. \n\nThou hast left sorrow in thy song,\nA voice not loud, but deep!\nThe glorious bowers of earth among,\nHow often didst thou weep! \n\nWhere couldst thou fix on mortal ground\nThy tender thoughts and high?\u2013\nNow peace the woman's heart hath found,\nAnd joy the poet's eye."}
