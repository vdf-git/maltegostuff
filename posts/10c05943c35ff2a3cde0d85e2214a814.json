{"subject": "To The Right Honourable The Lady Sarah Cowper.", "text": "Let me the Honour soon obtain,\nFor which I long have hop'd in vain;\nSince I, alas! am now confin'd,\nYour Visit would be doubly kind.\n\nWhat Sorrows have I not to fear,\nTy'd to the Bed of Sickness here?\nWhen all that's human, quits the Place,\nAnd Winter shews his horrid Face;\nWhilst Desolation proudly stalks\nAlong the dull, deserted Walks.\nMethinks the Skies already lour;\nLoud, from the Hills, the Torrents pour;\nThe Shops are shut; the Days are dark;\nAnd scarce a Dog is left to bark.\nO, shield me from the dreadful Storms,\nWhich my distemper'd Fancy forms!\n\nThe thoughtless Fair the Toilet prize,\nThere practise Smiles, and point their Eyes:\nBut Cowper, negligent of Art,\nChose, early wise, the better Part.\nYet from your Mind some Moments spare;\nThe Stranger be a--while your Care,\nWho now beneath Affliction bends,\nFar from her Country, and her Friends.\nCome, and my anxious Heart relieve:\nFor in your Presence who could grieve?"}
