{"subject": "COMING TO TERMS WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA", "text": "Why our son, why?\n\nEvery morning the same dark chorus wakes me\n\nAnd I wonder how I am still alive.\n\n'Balance the forces of life and death'\n\nIs the Kleinian recipe for survival.\n\n'It is God's will, life is meant to test us'\n\nMy Christian heritage tells me.\n\n'Life is a vale of soul making'\n\nKeats reminds us.\n\nInsistently the morning traffic hums\n\nAs I sip my tea, list calls to make,\n\nSigh in frustration at unread books.\n\nFor solace I look at cards of Haworth\n\nMoorland vistas of unending paths\n\nCloudscapes only a Constable could paint\n\nHigh Withens in a gale, the sloping village street.\n\nHow? When? Why?\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcThe truth' - if such an entity exists - \n\nIs that I want to run away."}
