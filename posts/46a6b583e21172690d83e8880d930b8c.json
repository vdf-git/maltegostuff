{"subject": "Fatal Love", "text": "Poor Hal caught his death standing under a spout\nExpecting till midnight when Nan would come out;\nBut fatal his patience, as cruel the dame,\nAnd cursed was the weather that quench'd the man's flame.\nWhoe'er thou art that reads these moral lines,\nMake love at home, and go to bed betimes."}
