{"subject": "Dora", "text": "It was, I well remember, the merry springtime when \nYoung Dora in the eventide came singing up the glen, \nAnd the song came up the glen, till one oft-repeated part \nIn a subtle stream of melody ran glowing through my heart. \nA fond desire, long cherished, till then I might control, \nTill then\u2014but oh! That witching strain swift drew it from my soul; \nSwift drew it from my soul, and she did not say me nay, \nAnd the world of love was all the world to us that happy day. \n\nI\u2019m happy now in thinking how happy I was then, \nWhen towards the glowing west my love went homeward down the glen; \nWent homeward down the glen, while my comfort surer grew, \nTill methought the old-faced hills at looked as they were happy too. \n\nAll happy, for that Dora and I so happy were! \nAll happy, for that human love had breathed its spirit there! \nHad breathed its spirit there, and had made them conscious grow \nOf the part they bore in that sweet time, that happy long ago."}
