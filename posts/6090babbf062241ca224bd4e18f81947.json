{"subject": "Winter", "text": "A DIAMOND glow of winter o\u2019er the world:\t\nAmid the chilly halo nigh the west\t\nFlickers a phantom violet bloom unfurled\t\n    Dim on the twilight\u2019s breast.\t\n\nOnly phantasmal blooms but for an hour,\t        \nA transient beauty; then the white stars shine\t\nChilling the heart: I long for thee to flower,\t\n    O bud of light divine.\t\n\nBut never visible to sense or thought\t\nThe flower of Beauty blooms afar withdrawn;\t        \nIf in our being then we know it not,\t\n    Or, knowing, it is gone."}
