{"subject": "Admonition", "text": "Long in the lap of childhood didst thou sleep,\nThink how thy youth like chaff did disappear;\nShall life\u2019s sweet Spring forever last? Look up,\nOld age approaches ominously near.\nOh shake thou off the world, even as the bird\nShakes off the midnight dew that clogged his wings.\nSoar upward, seek redemption from thy guilt\nAnd from the earthly dross that round thee clings.\nDraw near to God, His holy angels know,\nFor whom His bounteous streams of mercy flow.\n\nTranslated by Emma Lazarus"}
