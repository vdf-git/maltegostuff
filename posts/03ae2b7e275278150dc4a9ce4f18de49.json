{"subject": "Immortality", "text": "I feel in all my limbs His boundless Grace;\nWithin my heart the Truth of life shines white.\nThe secret heights of God my soul now climbs;\nNo dole, no sombre pang, no death in my sight.\n\nNo mortal days and nights can shake my calm;\nA Light above sustains my secret soul.\nAll doubts with grief are banished from my deeps,\nMy eyes of light perceive my cherished Goal.\n\nThough in the world, I am above its woe;\nI dwell in an ocean of supreme release.\nMy mind, a core of the One's unmeasured thoughts;\nThe star vast welkin hugs my Spirit's peace.\n\nMy eternal days are found in speeding time;\nI play upon His Flute of rhapsody.\nImpossible deeds no more impossible seem;\nIn birth chains now shines Immortality."}
