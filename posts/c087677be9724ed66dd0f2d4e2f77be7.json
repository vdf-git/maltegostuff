{"subject": "The Englishman In Italy", "text": "PIANO DI SORRENTO\n\nFort, Fort, my beloved one,\n  Sit here by my side,\nOn my knees put up both little feet!\n  I was sure, if I tried,\nI could make you laugh spite of Scirocco.\n  Now, open your eyes,\nLet me keep you amused till he vanish\n  In black from the skies,\nWith telling my memories over\n  As you tell your beads;\nAll the Plain saw me gather, I garland\n  ---The flowers or the weeds.\n\nTime for rain! for your long hot dry Autumn\n  Had net-worked with brown\nThe white skin of each grape on the bunches,\n  Marked like a quail's crown,\nThose creatures you make such account of,\n  Whose heads,---speckled white\nOver brown like a great spider's back,\n  As I told you last night,---\nYour mother bites off for her supper.\n  Red-ripe as could be,\nPomegranates were chapping and splitting\n  In halves on the tree:\nAnd betwixt the loose walls of great flint-stone,\n  Or in the thick dust\nOn the path, or straight out of the rock-side,\n  Wherever could thrust\nSome burnt sprig of bold hardy rock-flower\n  Its yellow face up,\nFor the prize were great butterflies fighting,\n  Some five for one cup.\nSo, I guessed, ere I got up this morning,\n  What change was in store,\nBy the quick rustle-down of the quail-nets\n  Which woke me before\nI could open my shutter, made fast\n  With a bough and a stone,\nAnd look thro' the twisted dead vine-twigs,\n  Sole lattice that's known.\nQuick and sharp rang the rings down the net-poles,\n  While, busy beneath,\nYour priest and his brother tugged at them,\n  The rain in their teeth.\nAnd out upon all the flat house-roofs\n  Where split figs lay drying,\nThe girls took the frails under cover:\n  Nor use seemed in trying\nTo get out the boats and go fishing,\n  For, under the cliff,\nFierce the black water frothed o'er the blind-rock.\n  No seeing our skiff\nArrive about noon from Amalfi,\n  ---Our fisher arrive\nAnd pitch down his basket before us,\n  All trembling alive\nWith pink and grey jellies, your sea-fruit;\n  You touch the strange lumps,\nAnd mouths gape there, eyes open, all manner\n  Of horns and of humps,\nWhich only the fisher looks grave at,\n  While round him like imps\nCling screaming the children as naked\n  And brown as his shrimps;\nHimself too as bare to the middle\n  ---You see round his neck\nThe string and its brass coin suspended,\n  That saves him from wreck.\nBut to-day not a bout reached Salerno,\n  So back, to a man,\nCame our friends, with whose help in the vineyards\n  Grape-harvest began.\nIn the vat, halfway up in our house-side,\n  Like blood the juice spins,\nWhile your brother all bare-legged is dancing\n  Till breathless he grins\nDead-beaten in effort on effort\n  To keep the grapes under,\nSince still when he seems all but master,\n  In pours the fresh plunder\nFrom girls who keep coming and going\n  With basket on shoulder,\nAnd eyes shut against the rain's driving;\n  Your girls that are older,---\nFor under the hedges of aloe,\n  And where, on its bed\nOf the orchard's black mould, the love-apple\n  Lies pulpy and red,\nAll the young ones are kneeling and filling\n  Their laps with the snails\nTempted out by this first rainy weather,---\n  Your best of regales,\nAs to-night will be proved to my sorrow,\n  When, supping in state,\nWe shall feast our grape-gleaners (two dozen,\n  Three over one plate)\nWith lasagne so tempting to swallow\n  In slippery ropes,\nAnd gourds fried in great purple slices,\n  That colour of popes.\nMeantime, see the grape bunch they've brought you:\n  The rain-water slips\nO'er the heavy blue bloom on each globe\n  Which the wasp to your lips\nStill follows with fretful persistence:\n  Nay, taste, while awake,\nThis half of a curd-white smooth cheese-ball\n  That peels, flake by flake,\nLike an onion, each smoother and whiter;\n  Next, sip this weak wine\nFrom the thin green glass flask, with its stopper,\n  A leaf of the vine;\nAnd end with the prickly-pear's red flesh\n  That leaves thro' its juice\nThe stony black seeds on your pearl-teeth.\n  Scirocco is loose!\nHark, the quick, whistling pelt of the olives\n  Which, thick in one's track,\nTempt the stranger to pick up and bite them,\n  Tho' not yet half black!\nHow the old twisted olive trunks shudder,\n  The medlars let fall\nTheir hard fruit, and the brittle great fig-trees\n  Snap off, figs and all,\nFor here comes the whole of the tempest!\n  No refuge, but creep\nBack again to my side and my shoulder,\n  And listen or sleep.\nO how will your country show next week,\n  When all the vine-boughs\nHave been stripped of their foliage to pasture\n  The mules and the cows?\nLast eve, I rode over the mountains;\n  Your brother, my guide,\nSoon left me, to feast on the myrtles\n  That offered, each side,\nTheir fruit-balls, black, glossy and luscious,---\n  Or strip from the sorbs\nA treasure, or, rosy and wondrous,\n  Those hairy gold orbs!\nBut my mule picked his sure sober path out,\n  Just stopping to neigh\nWhen he recognized down in the valley\n  His mates on their way\nWith the faggots and barrels of water;\n  And soon we emerged\nFrom the plain, where the woods could scarce follow;\n  And still as we urged\nOur way, the woods wondered, and left us,\n  As up still we trudged\nThough the wild path grew wilder each instant,\n  And place was e'en grudged\n'Mid the rock-chasms and piles of loose stones\n  Like the loose broken teeth\nOf some monster which climbed there to die\n  From the ocean beneath---\nPlace was grudged to the silver-grey fume-weed\n  That clung to the path,\nAnd dark rosemary ever a-dying\n  That, 'spite the wind's wrath,\nSo loves the salt rock's face to seaward,\n  And lentisks*1 as staunch\nTo the stone where they root and bear berries,\n  And ... what shows a branch\nCoral-coloured, transparent, with circlets\n  Of pale seagreen leaves;\nOver all trod my mule with the caution\n  Of gleaners o'er sheaves,\nStill, foot after foot like a lady,\n  Till, round after round,\nHe climbed to the top of Calvano,\n  And God's own profound\nWas above me, and round me the mountains,\n  And under, the sea,\nAnd within me my heart to bear witness\n  What was and shall be.\nOh, heaven and the terrible crystal!\n  No rampart excludes\nYour eye from the life to be lived\n  In the blue solitudes.\nOh, those mountains, their infinite movement!\n  Still moving with you;\nFor, ever some new head and breast of them\n  Thrusts into view\nTo observe the intruder; you see it\n  If quickly you turn\nAnd before they escape you surprise them.\n  They grudge you should learn\nHow the soft plains they look on, lean over\n  And love (they pretend)\n---Cower beneath them, the flat sea-pine crouches,\n  The wild fruit-trees bend,\nE'en the myrtle-leaves curl, shrink and shut:\n  All is silent and grave:\n'Tis a sensual and timorous beauty,\n  How fair! but a slave.\nSo, I turned to the sea; and there slumbered\n  As greenly as ever\nThose isles of the siren, your Galli;\n  No ages can sever\nThe Three, nor enable their sister\n  To join them,---halfway\nOn the voyage, she looked at Ulysses---\n  No farther to-day,\nTho' the small one, just launched in the wave,\n  Watches breast-high and steady\nFrom under the rock, her bold sister\n  Swum halfway already.\nFort, shall we sail there together\n  And see from the sides\nQuite new rocks show their faces, new haunts\n  Where the siren abides?\nShall we sail round and round them, close over\n  The rocks, tho' unseen,\nThat ruffle the grey glassy water\n  To glorious green?\nThen scramble from splinter to splinter,\n  Reach land and explore,\nOn the largest, the strange square black turret\n  With never a door,\nJust a loop to admit the quick lizards;\n  Then, stand there and hear\nThe birds' quiet singing, that tells us\n  What life is, so clear?\n---The secret they sang to Ulysses\n  When, ages ago,\nHe heard and he knew this life's secret\n  I hear and I know.\n\nAh, see! The sun breaks o'er Calvano;\n  He strikes the great gloom\nAnd flutters it o'er the mount's summit\n  In airy gold fume.\nAll is over. Look out, see the gipsy,\n  Our tinker and smith,\nHas arrived, set up bellows and forge,\n  And down-squatted forthwith\nTo his hammering, under the wall there;\n  One eye keeps aloof\nThe urchins that itch to be putting\n  His jews'-harps to proof,\nWhile the other, thro' locks of curled wire,\n  Is watching how sleek\nShines the hog, come to share in the windfall\n  ---Chew, abbot's own cheek!\nAll is over. Wake up and come out now,\n  And down let us go,\nAnd see the fine things got in order\n  At church for the show\nOf the Sacrament, set forth this evening.\n  To-morrow's the Feast\nOf the Rosary's Virgin, by no means\n  Of Virgins the least,\nAs you'll hear in the off-hand discourse\n  Which (all nature, no art)\nThe Dominican brother, these three weeks,\n  Was getting by heart.\nNot a pillar nor post but is dizened\n  With red and blue papers;\nAll the roof waves with ribbons, each altar\n  A-blaze with long tapers;\nBut the great masterpiece is the scaffold\n  Rigged glorious to hold\nAll the fiddlers and fifers and drummers\n  And trumpeters bold,\nNot afraid of Bellini nor Auber,\n  Who, when the priest's hoarse,\nWill strike us up something that's brisk\n  For the feast's second course. \nAnd then will the flaxen-wigged Image\n  Be carried in pomp\nThro' the plain, while in gallant procession\n  The priests mean to stomp.\nAll round the glad church lie old bottles\n  With gunpowder stopped,\nWhich will be, when the Image re-enters,\n  Religiously popped;\nAnd at night from the crest of Calvano\n  Great bonfires will hang,\nOn the plain will the trumpets join chorus,\n  And more poppers bang.\nAt all events, come---to the garden\n  As far as the wall;\nSee me tap with a hoe on the plaster\n  Till out there shall fall\nA scorpion with wide angry nippers!\n\n  ---''Such trifles!'' you say?\nFort, in my England at home,\n  Men meet gravely to-day\nAnd debate, if abolishing Corn-laws\n  Be righteous and wise\n---If 'twere proper, Scirocco should vanish\n  In black from the skies!\n\n*1 The mastic tree (resinous)."}
