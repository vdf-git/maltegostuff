{"subject": "The Over-Heart", "text": "Above, below, in sky and sod,\nIn leaf and spar, in star and man,\nWell might the wise Athenian scan\nThe geometric signs of God,\nThe measured order of His plan.\n\nAnd India's mystics sang aright\nOf the One Life pervading all,--\nOne Being's tidal rise and fall\nIn soul and form, in sound and sight,--\nEternal outflow and recall.\n\nGod is: and man in guilt and fear\nThe central fact of Nature owns;\nKneels, trembling, by his altar-stones,\nAnd darkly dreams the ghastly smear\nOf blood appeases and atones.\n\nGuilt shapes the Terror: deep within\nThe human heart the secret lies\nOf all the hideous deities;\nAnd, painted on a ground of sin,\nThe fabled gods of torment rise!\n\nAnd what is He? The ripe grain nods,\nThe sweet dews fall, the sweet flowers blow;\nBut darker signs His presence show\nThe earthquake and the storm are God's,\nAnd good and evil interflow.\n\nO hearts of love! O souls that turn\nLike sunflowers to the pure and best!\nTo you the truth is manifest:\nFor they the mind of Christ discern\nWho lean like John upon His breast!\n\nIn him of whom the sibyl told,\nFor whom the prophet's harp was toned,\nWhose need the sage and magian owned,\nThe loving heart of God behold,\nThe hope for which the ages groaned!\n\nFade, pomp of dreadful imagery\nWherewith mankind have deified\nTheir hate, and selfishness, and pride!\nLet the scared dreamer wake to see\nThe Christ of Nazareth at his side!\n\nWhat doth that holy Guide require?\nNo rite of pain, nor gift of blood,\nBut man a kindly brotherhood,\nLooking, where duty is desire,\nTo Him, the beautiful and good.\n\nGone be the faithlessness of fear,\nAnd let the pitying heaven's sweet rain\nWash out the altar's bloody stain;\nThe law of Hatred disappear,\nThe law of Love alone remain.\n\nHow fall the idols false and grim!\nAnd to! their hideous wreck above\nThe emblems of the Lamb and Dove!\nMan turns from God, not God from him;\nAnd guilt, in suffering, whispers Love!\n\nThe world sits at the feet of Christ,\nUnknowing, blind, and unconsoled;\nIt yet shall touch His garment's fold,\nAnd feel the heavenly Alchemist\nTransform its very dust to gold.\n\nThe theme befitting angel tongues\nBeyond a mortal's scope has grown.\nO heart of mine! with reverence own\nThe fulness which to it belongs,\nAnd trust the unknown for the known."}
