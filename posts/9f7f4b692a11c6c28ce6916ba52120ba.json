{"subject": "Sonnet To The Sea-Serpent.", "text": "'Hugest that swims the ocean stream.'\nWELTER upon the waters, mighty one\u2014\nAnd stretch thee in the ocean's trough of brine;\nTurn thy wet scales up to the wind and sun,\nAnd toss the billow from thy flashing fin;\nHeave thy deep breathings to the ocean's din,\nAnd bound upon its ridges in thy pride:\nOr dive down to its lowest depths, and in\nThe caverns where its unknown monsters hide,\nMeasure thy length beneath the gulf-stream's tide\u2014\nOr rest thee on that naval of the sea\nWhere, floating on the Maelstrom, abide\nThe krakens sheltering under Norway's lee;\nBut go not to Nahant, lest men should swear,\nYou are a great deal bigger than you are."}
