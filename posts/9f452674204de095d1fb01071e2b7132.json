{"subject": "Settle The Question Right", "text": "However the battle is ended, \n Though proudly the victor comes, \nWith flaunting flags and neighing nags\n And echoing roll of drums; \nStill truth proclaims this motto\n In letters of living light, \nNo question is ever settled\n Until it is settled right.\n\nThough the heel of the strong oppressor\n May grind the weak in the dust, \nAnd the voices of fame with one acclaim\n May call him great and just; \nLet those who applaud take warning\n And keep this motto in sight, \nNo question is ever settled \n Until it is settled right.\n\nLet those who have failed take courage, \n Though the enemy seem to have won; \nIf he be in the wrong, though his ranks are strong, \n The battle is not yet done.\nFor sure as the morning follows\n The darkest hour of night, \nNo question is ever settled\n Until it is settled right.\n\nO men, bowed down with labour, \n O women, young yet old, \nO heart, oppressed in the toiler\u2019s breast\n And crushed by the power of gold, \nKeep on with your weary battle\n Against triumphant might; \nNo question is ever settled\n Until it is settled right."}
