{"subject": "The Parting Hour", "text": "Not yet, dear love, not yet: the sun is high;\nYou said last night, 'At sunset I will go.'\nCome to the garden, where when blossoms die\nNo word is spoken; it is better so:\nAh! bitter word 'Farewell.'\n\nHark! how the birds sing sunny songs of spring!\nSoon they will build, and work will silence them;\nSo we grow less light-hearted as years bring\nLife's grave responsibilities - and then\nThe bitter word 'Farewell.'\n\nThe violets fret to fragrance 'neath your feet,\nHeaven's gold sunlight dreams aslant your hair:\nNo flower for me! your mouth is far more sweet.\nO, let my lips forget, while lingering there,\nLove's bitter word 'Farewell.'\n\nSunset already! have we sat so long?\nThe parting hour, and so much left unsaid!\nThe garden has grown silent - void of song,\nOur sorrow shakes us with a sudden dread!\nAh! bitter word 'Farewell.'"}
