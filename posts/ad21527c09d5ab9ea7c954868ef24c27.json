{"subject": "Hardware Sparrows", "text": "Out for a deadbolt, light bulbs \nand two-by-fours, I find a flock \nof sparrows safe from hawks\n\nand weather under the roof \nof Lowe's amazing discount \nstore. They skitter from the racks\n\nof stockpiled posts and hoses \nto a spill of winter birdseed \non the concrete floor. How\n\nthey know to forage here, \nI can't guess, but the automatic \ndoor is close enough,\n\nand we've had a week \nof storms. They are, after all, \nubiquitous, though poor,\n\ntheir only song an irritating \nnoise, and yet they soar \nto offer, amid hardware, rope\n\nand handyman brochures, \nsome relief, as if a flurry \nof notes from Mozart swirled\n\nfrom seed to ceiling, entreating \nus to set aside our evening \nchores and take grace where\n\nwe find it, saying it is possible, \neven in this month of flood, \nblackout and frustration,\n\nto float once more on sheer \nsurvival and the shadowy \nbliss we exist to explore."}
