{"subject": "The Gates of Paradise", "text": "The eternal entrance into Eden\nIs not locked with seven precious seals;\nIt has no charms nor light of heaven,\nAnd the people don't know that it is.\n\nIt's a doorway in a wall forgotten - \nStones, moss and nothing more else,\nNear stands a beggar; and the rotten,\nKeys are hanging at his gaudy waist.\n\nPaladins ride by in agitation,\nTrumpets wail, and minted silver chant;\nNobody spares his attention\nTo the Peter -  the Apostle, the saint.\n\nThey dream: There, by Sepulchre of Savor,\nParadise will open doors for us;\nAt the footing of the Mount Thabor\nThe committed hour will thrust.\n\nSo by the armored monster goes;\nIn the air the trumpets ring and wail;\nThe Apostle in the tattered cloth,\nLike a beggar, looks and poor and pale.\nTranslated by Yevgeny Bonver, September, 1995"}
