{"subject": "In The Days Of The Golden Rod", "text": "Across the meadow in brooding shadow\nI walk to drink of the autumn's wine\u00ad\nThe charm of story, the artist's glory,\nTo-day on these silvering hills is mine;\nOn height, in hollow, where'er I follow,\nBy mellow hillside and searing sod,\nIts plumes uplifting, in light winds drifting,\nI see the glimmer of golden-rod. \n\nIn this latest comer the vanished summer\nHas left its sunshine the world to cheer,\nAnd bids us remember in late September\nWhat beauty mates with the passing year.\nThe days that are fleetest are still the sweetest,\nAnd life is near to the heart of God,\nAnd the peace of heaven to earth is given\nIn this wonderful time of the golden-rod."}
