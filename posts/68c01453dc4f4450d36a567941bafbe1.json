{"subject": "A Sonnet", "text": "My daisy sweet is drooping,\nAlone upon the lee;\nA frost there came in evil hour\nAnd nipt it cruelly.\n\nBut when the winter's over\nI'll back return to thee,\nAnd thou shalt rise and smile again\nIn beauty on the lee.\n\nAnd lest the winds of heaven\nToo rudely on thee blow,\nWithin a secret bower of mine\nIn safety shalt thou grow.\n\nAnd there I'll gaze upon thee\nWith an adoring eye;\nAnd sprinkle thee, my bonny flower,\nWith gushing tears of joy.\n\nAnd when the sun no longer\nDoth cheer thee from above,\nI'll warm thee, as thou fadest away,\nWith sighs of endless love."}
