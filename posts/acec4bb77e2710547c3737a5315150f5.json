{"subject": "Beauty Is Vain", "text": "While roses are so red,\nWhile lilies are so white,\nShall a woman exalt her face\nBecause it gives delight?\nShe's not so sweet as a rose,\nA lily's straighter than she,\nAnd if she were as red or white\nShe'd be but one of three.\n\nWhether she flush in love's summer\nOr in its winter grow pale, \nWhether she flaunt her beauty\nOr hide it away in a veil,\nBe she red or white,\nAnd stand she erect or bowed,\nTime will win the race he runs with her\nAnd hide her away in a shroud."}
