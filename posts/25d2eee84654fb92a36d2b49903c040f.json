{"subject": "The Smiling Isle", "text": "I\nWe have no daily papers \nTo tell of Newport capers, \nNo proud four hundred to look down on ordinary folk;\nNo Scotch imported liquors, \nNo Stock Exchange and tickers \nTo lure us on with rosy hopes and some day land us broke; \nWe've not a single college \nWhere youth may get a knowledge \nOf chorus girls and cigarettes, of poker and the like;\nNo janitors to sass us, \nNo bell-boys to harass us, \nAnd we've never known the pleasure of a labor union strike.\n\nII\nWe have no prize-fight sluggers, \nNo vaudevillian muggers, \nNo one of us has ever shot- the chutes or looped the loop;\nNo cable-cars or trolleys, \nNo life-insurance jollies, \nNo bank cashiers to take our money 'ere they fly the coop;\nNo bookies and no races, \nNo seaside summer places; \nNo Bertha Clays and Duchesses to make the females cry;\nWe have no dairy lunches, \nWhere they eat their food in bunches, \nAnd we don't insult our stomachs with the thing they call mince-pie.\n\nIII\nWe have no short-haired ladies \nWho are always raising Hades \nWith their finical and funny old reformatory fads;\nNo ten-cent publications, \nSold at all the railway stations, \nWith a page or two of reading and a hundred stuffed with ads; \nWe never chew in Sulu \nAny pepsin gum or tolu \u2014 \nIn fact, we're not such savages as some of you might think; \nAnd during intermission, \nWe always crave permission,\nBefore we walk on other people just to get a drink.\nWe have no politicians, \nAnd under no conditions \nDo we tolerate the fraud who cures by laying on of hands;\nWe have no elocutionists, \nNo social revolutionists, \nNo amateur dramatics, and no upright baby grands;\nWe don't play golf and tennis, \nAnd we never know the menace \nOf a passing fad or fancy that may turn the nation's head; \nI'm proud of my dominion\nWhen I voice the bold opinion\nThat we'll never know the tortures of a patent folding-bed.\nAnd that is why, you'll understand, \nI love my own, my native land, \nMy little isle of Sulu,\nSmiling isle of Sulu! \nI'm not ready to say good-by; \nI'm mighty sorry that I have to die."}
