{"subject": "Deceptions:", "text": "When I look across the ocean and I see the sky aglow,\n I am convinced heaven is on other row;\n But deception of my senses let me have another dream;\n Things are not the same as appearances make them seem.\n\n I see the sky is blue but is that really true,\n And I see the stars twinkling as if they are watching you;\n Makes me think of me my sanity is unsound,\n Or my vision failed to recognize what my questioning mind has found.\n\n Life is what I have and this is what I see,\n But is there really death as is supposed to be.\n Still life has no secrets where it has gone,\n But a dream will show me I am not alone.\n\n Tomorrow when my shadow hides beneath the dust,\n And my friends will laugh and cry and moan a loss,\n My son will walk the path where I have trod;\n For he is my transformation to walk with GOD."}
