{"subject": "Rondeau At The Train Stop", "text": "It bothers me: the genital smell of the bay\ndrifting toward me on the T stop, the train\ncircling the city like a dingy, year-round\nChristmas display. The Puritans were right! Sin\nis everywhere in Massachusetts, hell-bound\n\nin the population. it bothers me\nbecause it's summer now and sticky - no rain\nto cool things down; heat like a wound\nthat will not close. Too hot, these shameful\npercolations of the body that bloom\nbetween strangers on a train. It bothers me\n\nnow that I'm alone and singles foam\naround the city, bothered by the lather, the rings\nof sweat. Know this bay's a watery animal, hind-end\nperpetually raised: a wanting posture, pain\nso apparent, wanting so much that it bothers me."}
