{"subject": "A Man Young And Old", "text": "I\nFirst Love\n\nTHOUGH nurtured like the sailing moon\nIn beauty's murderous brood,\nShe walked awhile and blushed awhile\nAnd on my pathway stood\nUntil I thought her body bore\nA heart of flesh and blood.\nBut since I laid a hand thereon\nAnd found a heart of stone\nI have attempted many things\nAnd not a thing is done,\nFor every hand is lunatic\nThat travels on the moon.\nShe smiled and that transfigured me\nAnd left me but a lout,\nMaundering here, and maundering there,\nEmptier of thought\nThan the heavenly circuit of its stars\nWhen the moon sails out.\n\nII\nHuman Dignity\nLike the moon her kindness is,\nIf kindness I may call\nWhat has no comprehension in't,\nBut is the same for all\nAs though my sorrow were a scene\nUpon a painted wall.\nSo like a bit of stone I lie\nUnder a broken tree.\nI could recover if I shrieked\nMy heart's agony\nTo passing bird, but I am dumb\nFrom human dignity.\n\nIII\nThe Mermaid \nA mermaid found a swimming lad,\nPicked him for her own,\nPressed her body to his body,\nLaughed; and plunging down\nForgot in cruel happiness\nThat even lovers drown.\n\nIV\nThe Death of the Hare\nI have pointed out the yelling pack,\nThe hare leap to the wood,\nAnd when I pass a compliment\nRejoice as lover should\nAt the drooping of an eye,\nAt the mantling of the blood.\nThen' suddenly my heart is wrung\nBy her distracted air\nAnd I remember wildness lost\nAnd after, swept from there,\nAm set down standing in the wood\nAt the death of the hare.\n\nV\nThe Empty Cup\nA crazy man that found a cup,\nWhen all but dead of thirst,\nHardly dared to wet his mouth\nImagining, moon-accursed,\nThat another mouthful\nAnd his beating heart would burst.\nOctober last I found it too\nBut found it dry as bone,\nAnd for that reason am I crazed\nAnd my sleep is gone.\n\nVI\nHis Memories\nWe should be hidden from their eyes,\nBeing but holy shows\nAnd bodies broken like a thorn\nWhereon the bleak north blows,\nTo think of buried Hector\nAnd that none living knows.\nThe women take so little stock\nIn what I do or say\nThey'd sooner leave their cosseting\nTo hear a jackass bray;\nMy arms are like the twisted thorn\nAnd yet there beauty lay;\nThe first of all the tribe lay there\nAnd did such pleasure take --\nShe who had brought great Hector down\nAnd put all Troy to wreck --\nThat she cried into this ear,\n'Strike me if I shriek.'\n\nVII\nThe Friends of his Youth\nLaughter not time destroyed my voice\nAnd put that crack in it,\nAnd when the moon's pot-bellied\nI get a laughing fit,\nFor that old Madge comes down the lane,\nA stone upon her breast,\nAnd a cloak wrapped about the stone,\nAnd she can get no rest\nWith singing hush and hush-a-bye;\nShe that has been wild\nAnd barren as a breaking wave\nThinks that the stone's a child.\nAnd Peter that had great affairs\nAnd was a pushing man\nShrieks, 'I am King of the Peacocks,'\nAnd perches on a stone;\nAnd then I laugh till tears run down\nAnd the heart thumps at my side,\nRemembering that her shriek was love\nAnd that he shrieks from pride.\n\nVIII\nSummer and Spring\nWe sat under an old thorn-tree\nAnd talked away the night,\nTold all that had been said or done\nSince first we saw the light,\nAnd when we talked of growing up\nKnew that we'd halved a soul\nAnd fell the one in t'other's arms\nThat we might make it whole;\nThen peter had a murdering look,\nFor it seemed that he and she\nHad spoken of their childish days\nUnder that very tree.\nO what a bursting out there was,\nAnd what a blossoming,\nWhen we had all the summer-time\nAnd she had all the spring!\n\nIX\nThe Secrets of the Old\nI have old women's sectets now\nThat had those of the young;\nMadge tells me what I dared not think\nWhen my blood was strong,\nAnd what had drowned a lover once\nSounds like an old song.\nThough Margery is stricken dumb\nIf thrown in Madge's way,\nWe three make up a solitude;\nFor none alive to-day\nCan know the stories that we know\nOr say the things we say:\nHow such a man pleased women most\nOf all that are gone,\nHow such a pair loved many years\nAnd such a pair but one,\nStories of the bed of straw\nOr the bed of down.\n\nX\nHis Wildness\nO bid me mount and sail up there\nAmid the cloudy wrack,\nFor peg and Meg and Paris' love\nThat had so straight a back,\nAre gone away, and some that stay\nHave changed their silk for sack.\nWere I but there and none to hear\nI'd have a peacock cry,\nFor that is natural to a man\nThat lives in memory,\nBeing all alone I'd nurse a stone\nAnd sing it lullaby.\n\nXI\nFrom 'Oedipus at Colonus'\nEndure what life God gives and ask no longer span;\nCease to remember the delights of youth, travel-wearied aged man;\nDelight becomes death-longing if all longing else be vain.\nEven from that delight memory treasures so,\nDeath, despair, division of families, all entanglements of mankind grow,\nAs that old wandering beggar and these God-hated children know.\nIn the long echoing street the laughing dancers throng,\nThe bride is catried to the bridegroom's chamber\nthrough torchlight and tumultuous song;\nI celebrate the silent kiss that ends short life or long.\nNever to have lived is best, ancient writers say;\nNever to have drawn the breath of life, never to have\nlooked into the eye of day;\nThe second best's a gay goodnight and quickly turn away."}
