{"subject": "Aconite", "text": "Polarity hits you at face, Thoughts. Move\ninversely. The deed, words, slogans\ndivide the eternity of time. No hygienic\npatience. Persons coming from channels only.\n\nThe thing. Image in hundred mirrors.\nVarieties of fakes and counterfeits. Foeticide.\nPaedophile. Necrophilia. Peddling pink flesh.\nIt is. Peels of skin left on roads. Your shape, \nmy contours, his art. I am passing through\na tunnel. Open-and-shut. No end. No beginning\nTwo nothings.\n\nWill keep on moving. Roaches are scuttling\nlike rats with wings. Their country. We are\noutsiders. Strangers. Not to reveal the names, \nNo landmarks on walls, intersections, doors.\nNo vigilance, No corporatized pain. No\nbleeding wounds.\n\nImpatience. Nobody opens the eyes.\nLong sleep. I pray, no waking up.\nLet the global warming end. Let the \nterror die of its own Aconite."}
