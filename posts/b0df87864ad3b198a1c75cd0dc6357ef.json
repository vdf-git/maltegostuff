{"subject": "Dawn", "text": "Roses upon roses \nSpread in sheets below, \nIn the high blue ether \nClouds that shine like snow, \nLightly, brightly, softly, \nSpread before thy feet, \nIn this tranquil season \nWait thy face to greet; \nWaits in hope all nature, \nO Aurora sweet! \n\nRadiant, pure she rises, \nIn her veil of white, \nWith her floating tresses \nGleaming golden bright, \nSpreading wide in ripples \nBy the zephyrs swayed, \nAnd her pearly pinions \nOpening, half displayed - \nGracious, fair Aurora, \nThe celestial maid. \n\nOn her brow bright jewels \nGlow in loveliness, \nAnd her joyous glances \nHeaven and earth caress; \nWhile her rose-lips, brighter \nThan earth's blooming bowers, \nSmiling blithely, scatter \nPerfume sweet in showers, \nMaking yet more fragrant \nMany-coloured flowers. \n\nNow the small birds twitter \n'Mid the leaves so green, \nBlending with their rustle; \nHail, O Dawn serene! \nHail! Thou changest darkness \nInto sunlight free, \nThe sad earth thou makest \nGlad and full of glee. \nAll created beings \nCry 'All hail' to thee. \n\nUnto thee each offers \nIts first gift in love, \nTenderest gift and holiest; \nCloud that floats above, \nZephyr, crystal streamlet, \nFlowers and nightingale - \nAll with love are melted, \nPraise thee, bid thee hail, \nHeavenly maiden, lovely \nIn thy shining veil! \n\nThou our hearts that charmest \nNow with such delight, \nLeave us not forsaken \nIn the grave's dark night! \nWhen our eyes are closing, \nLet it beam and shine \nStill before our souls' eyes, \nThat sweet light of thine, \nFull of hope and promise, \nDawn, thou maid divine!"}
