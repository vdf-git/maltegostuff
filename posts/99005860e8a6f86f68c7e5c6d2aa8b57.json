{"subject": "The Swallows", "text": "AH! swallows, is it so?\nDid loving lingering summer, whose slow pace\nTarried among late blossoms, loth to go,\nGather the darkening cloud-wraps round her face\nAnd weep herself away in last week's rain?\nCan no new sunlight waken her again? \n'Yes,' one pale rose a-blow\nHas answered from the trellised lane;\nThe flickering swallows answer 'No.'\n\nFrom out the dim grey sky\nThe arrowy swarm breaks forth and specks the air,\nWhile, one by one, birds wheel and float and fly,\nAnd now are gone, then suddenly are there;\nTill lo, the heavens are empty of them all.\nOh, fly, fly south, from leaves that fade and fall, \nFrom shivering flowers that die;\nFree swallows, fly from winter's thrall,\nYe who can give the gloom good-bye.\n\nBut what for us who stay\nTo hear the winds and watch the boughs grow black,\nAnd in the soddened mornings, day by day,\nCount what lost sweets bestrew the nightly track\nOf frost-foot winter trampling towards his throne?\nSwallows, who have the sunlight for your own,\nFly on your sunward way;\nFor you has January buds new blown,\nFor us the snows and gloom and grey.\n\nOn, on, beyond our reach,\nSwallows, with but your longing for a guide:\nLet the hills rise, let the waves tear the beach,\nYe will not balk your course nor turn aside,\nBut find the palms and twitter in the sun.\nAnd well for them whose eager wings have won\nThe longed for goal of flight;\nBut what of them in twilights dun\nWho long, but have no wings for flight?"}
