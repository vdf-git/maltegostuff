{"subject": "Phoebe Ann, The Proud Girl", "text": "This Phoebe Ann was a very proud girl,\nHer nose had always an upward curl.\nShe thought herself better than all others beside,\nAnd beat even the peacock himself in pride.\nShe thought the earth was so dirty and brown,\nThat never, by chance, would she look down;\nAnd she held up her head in the air so high\nThat her neck began stretching by and by.\nIt stretched and it stretched; and it grew so long\nThat her parents thought something must be wrong.\nIt stretched and stretched, and they soon began\nTo look up with fear at their Phoebe Ann.\nThey prayed her to stop her upward gaze,\nBut Phoebe kept on in her old proud ways,\nUntil her neck had grown so long and spare\nThat her head was more than her neck could bear-\nAnd it bent to the ground, like a willow tree,\nAnd brought down the head of this proud Phoebe,\nUntil whenever she went out a walk to take,\nThe boys would shout, 'Here comes a snake!'\nHer head got to be so heavy to drag on,\nThat she had to put it on a little wagon.\nSo don't, my friends, hold your head too high,\nOr your neck may stretch, too, by and by."}
