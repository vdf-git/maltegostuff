{"subject": "To J. M.", "text": "Let Fate or Insufficiency provide\nMean ends for men who what they are would be:\nPenned in their narrow day no change they see\nSave one which strikes the blow to brutes and pride.\nOur faith is ours and comes not on a tide:\nAnd whether Earth's great offspring, by decree,\nMust rot if they abjure rapacity,\nNot argument but effort shall decide.\nThey number many heads in that hard flock:\nTrim swordsmen they push forth: yet try thy steel.\nThou, fighting for poor humankind, wilt feel\nThe strength of Roland in thy wrist to hew\nA chasm sheer into the barrier rock,\nAnd bring the army of the faithful through."}
