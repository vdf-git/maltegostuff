{"subject": "Lines Inscribed To The Memory", "text": "O! Johnson, learned, venerable shade,\nWhat havock of thy fame hath friendship made,\nWhat childish trophies round thy manly bust,\nWhat noisome weeds are planted in thy dust!\nYet sleep in peace--and though to me unknown\n(Save from the musick of thy learn'd renown)\nAccept this verse, if aught my verse can boast\nTo sooth the anguish of thy injured Ghost.\nWhat though thy friends, thy dearest friends, have tried,\nTo blaze those faults, which e'en thy foes would hide,\nThough like a gem by some rude artist set,\nWe mark thy flaws, thy brilliancy forget,\nYet rest assured, when all their triumph's o'er,\nThy friends and enemies are known no more,\nWhen time shall mould the sprightly works of Thrale,\nAnd turn to vinegar her choicest ale,\nWhen Boswell, of his birth and friendships proud,\nMac Lean, Mac Sweyn, Mac Cromheil, and Mac Cloud,\nIndignant round the savoury steak shall fry,\nOr light Mundungus in the Isle of Sky,\nWhen Pindar too, Soame Jennyngs, and myself,\nShall lie, meet victims, on a grocer's shelf:\nStill shalt thou last, and o'er thy hallow'd tomb,\nFair Science weep, and bays perennial bloom."}
