{"subject": "Genesis Iii. 24.", "text": "ALAS! and can the tale be true! \nCould they to whom was given \nAll blessing, like the freshening dew, \nAll mercies straight from heaven; \nCould these be false? could these be frail? \nCould these rebellious fall? \nCould their obedience ever fail \nTo Him who gave them all? \n\nOh wherefore, whilst they yet might stay, \nEre yet their doom was sealed, \nEre angels kept the guarded way, \nWas not their misery healed? \nWas there not life's immortal tree, \nWas not its fruitage fair, \nAnd might not they immortal be, \nOnly by tasting there? \n\nOh! who could doubt that ancient tale, \nWhilst daily we behold \nMen in their faith and fervour fail\u2014 \nHearts in their trust grow cold. \nToo surely that first guilty pair \nSin's deep foundations built; \nToo surely in our hearts we bear \nThe record of their guilt. \n\nAlas! how many dare to sin \n'Gainst God's high majesty, \nNor strive a healing balm to win, \nFrom his life-giving tree. \nHow stand our passions in the way, \nAs hot and burning brands; \nBut oh ! not lit 'midst heaven's pure day, \nNor held by angel hands. \n\nOh Father! these our fiery swords, \nAgainst ourselves are turned, \nThey stand 'twixt us and thy pure words, \nAye, near heaven's gate have burned: \nFrom demon hands the weapons wrench, \nThat now in fear we see, \nTheir lightning flames subdue and quench, \nAnd let us pass to Thee!"}
