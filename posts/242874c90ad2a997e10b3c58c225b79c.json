{"subject": "Chosen Tree", "text": "When Stradivarius felt: he is about to carve\nHis last violin \u2014 on a stormy night, a gray old man,\nHe went off to the woods, stooped over with his stick.\nLike burning violin bows, lightning attacked him.\nHe kneels at every tree, applies his breathing ear:\nOh, which chosen tree will now reveal\nThe one great tone? Which tree will give the wood\nFor Stradivarius to carve his last violin?\nThe smallest seed of sound \u2014 its pain\nWeeps in him. The pain of raising\nViolins. As if he himself had liberated from a prison\nHis own death\nAlong with the purest sounds.\nHe asks forgiveness of the shadows\nFor sawing off their heads \u2014 to capture\nThe nightingale inside his violin and to unravel\nThe grief of a tree after the first rain, a tree\nThat cannot flee assaulting saws \u2026\n\nWith a cold iron glove, the storm fells him.\nA cloud stands at his head with a spade.\nAnd Stradivarius barely\nWhispers: Chosen Tree,\nSaw apart my body \u2014 the weeping form,\nAnd carve from me, paint with my blood \u2014 the last violin."}
