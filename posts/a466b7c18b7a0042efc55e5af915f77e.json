{"subject": "The Alps. Thusis.", "text": "OUT from the house I went when early dawn \nAs yet had hardly ting'd the peaks with gold, \nAnd cottage-smoke in faint ascending wreaths \nStole from the inner depth of valleys old. \nAt length upon a sunny hill I sat, \nLooking at meadows cattle-strown below, \nAnd upwards where into the clear blue sky \nShot out the tapering peaks of pathless snow: \nAnd many similes within my brain \nStirr'd, as if Nature spoke aloud to me, \nAnd said, 'Oh child that watcheth ever, learn \nThat which I mean by my solemnity. \nEven as these high peaks above thee rear, \nSo stand great souls above the ranks of men; \nNo summer warmth caresses year by year \nGrand heads encircled by a glorious pain. \nBut if of verdure bare, thou must not doubt \nJoys of their own to such great souls are given; \nLonely they are; but though forlorn of men, \nThey stand in the unchanging light of heaven. \nOh child! receive their teaching; even as here, \nBelow them, fir and flower are glistering bright, \nWarmer, more beautiful, the dawn descends, \nTill all the lowest vales are fill'd with light.'"}
