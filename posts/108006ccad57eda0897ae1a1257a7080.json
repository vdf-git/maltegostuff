{"subject": "Relativity", "text": "I looked down on a daisied lawn\nTo where a host of tiny eyes\nOf snow and gold from velvet shone\nAnd made me think of starry skies.\n\nI looked up to the vasty night\nWhere stars were very small indeed,\nAnd in their galaxy of light\nThey made me think of daised mead.\n\nI took a daisy in my hold;\nIts snowy rays were tipped with rose,\nAnd with its tiny boss of gold\nI thought--how like a star it glows!\n\nI dreamt I plucked from Heaven's field\nA star and held it in my hand.\nSaid I: \"The might of God I wield,\nThe Great and Small I understand.\"\n\nFor when the All is said and done,\nIn Time and Space I seem to see\nA daisy equal to a sun,\nBetween heart-beats--Eternity"}
