{"subject": "Poem (At night Chinamen jump)", "text": "At night Chinamen jump   \non Asia with a thump \n\nwhile in our willful way   \nwe, in secret, play \n\naffectionate games and bruise   \nour knees like China's shoes. \n\nThe birds push apples through   \ngrass the moon turns blue, \n\nthese apples roll beneath   \nour buttocks like a heath \n\nfull of Chinese thrushes   \nflushed from China's bushes. \n\nAs we love at night   \nbirds sing out of sight, \n\nChinese rhythms beat   \nthrough us in our heat, \n\nthe apples and the birds   \nmove us like soft words, \n\nwe couple in the grace   \nof that mysterious race."}
