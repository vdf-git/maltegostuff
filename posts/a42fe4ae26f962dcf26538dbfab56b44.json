{"subject": "A Descriptive Poem On The Silvery Tay", "text": "Beautiful silvery Tay,\nWith your landscapes, so lovely and gay,\nAlong each side of your waters, to Perth all the way;\nNo other river in the world has got scenery more fine,\nOnly I am told the beautiful Rhine,\nNear to Wormit Bay, it seems very fine,\nWhere the Railway Bridge is towering above its waters sublime,\nAnd the beautiful ship Mars,\nWith her Juvenile Tare,\nBoth lively and gay,\nDoes carelessly lie By night and by day,\nIn the beautiful Bay\nOf the silvery Tay.\nBeautiful, beautiful silvery Tay,\nThy scenery is enchanting on a fine summer day,\nNear by Balnerino it is beautiful to behold,\nWhen the trees are in full bloom and the cornfields seems like gold -\nAnd nature's face seems gay,\nAnd the lambkins they do play,\nAnd the humming bee is on the wing,\nIt is enough to make one sing,\nWhile they carelessly do stray,\nAlong the beautiful banks of the silvery Tay,\nBeautiful silvery Tay,\nRolling smoothly on your way,\nNear by Newport, as clear as the day,\nThy scenery around is charming I'll be bound...\nAnd would make the heart of any one feel light and gay on a fine summer day,\nTo view the beautiful scenery along the banks of the silvery Tay."}
