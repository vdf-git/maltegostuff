{"subject": "Planting A Sequoia", "text": "All afternoon my brothers and I have worked in the orchard,\nDigging this hole, laying you into it, carefully packing the soil.\nRain blackened the horizon, but cold winds kept it over the Pacific,\nAnd the sky above us stayed the dull gray\nOf an old year coming to an end.\n\nIn Sicily a father plants a tree to celebrate his first son's birth--\nAn olive or a fig tree--a sign that the earth has one more life to bear.\nI would have done the same, proudly laying new stock into my father's orchard,\nA green sapling rising among the twisted apple boughs,\nA promise of new fruit in other autumns.\n\nBut today we kneel in the cold planting you, our native giant,\nDefying the practical custom of our fathers,\nWrapping in your roots a lock of hair, a piece of an infant's birth cord,\nAll that remains above earth of a first-born son,\nA few stray atoms brought back to the elements.\n\nWe will give you what we can--our labor and our soil,\nWater drawn from the earth when the skies fail,\nNights scented with the ocean fog, days softened by the circuit of bees.\nWe plant you in the corner of the grove, bathed in western light,\nA slender shoot against the sunset.\n\nAnd when our family is no more, all of his unborn brothers dead,\nEvery niece and nephew scattered, the house torn down,\nHis mother's beauty ashes in the air,\nI want you to stand among strangers, all young and emphemeral to you,\nSilently keeping the secret of your birth."}
