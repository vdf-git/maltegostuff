{"subject": "The End Of Out Of The Past", "text": "I never told you I was anything but what I am,\" she says.\nBlack and white, the sunset behind Lake Tahoe looks spectacular.\nShe turns and goes upstairs, his chance to light a cigarette\nand dial the operator. She slips the pistol into her briefcase,\ngives the bathroom a cursory final glance. Moments later,\nsitting on the couch, he hands her a shot of brandy.\n\"Thanks\", she says. \"Por nada,\" he answers, pouring one\nfor himself. She says she thinks they both deserve a break. \"We deserve\neach other,\" he replies, and wings his glass into the empty fireplace.\nShe's unperturbed, strictly business, already in Mexico.\nHis sleepy expression shows he knows exactly where they're going.\nNight has already covered most of the country. The airwaves\nare vibrating with strains of \"Sentimental Journey\", \"Satin Doll\",\nand \"String of Pearls\". As they get into his Chevy station wagon,\nI could be five and just waking up from another nightmare.\nHalf the world is lying in ruins."}
