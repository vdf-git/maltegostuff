{"subject": "On The Way Overseas", "text": "April,1940\n\nMy thoughts go back to your treasury, \nDwelling a little, wistfully content\nAmong remembered beauties, and I see\nAll your enchantments, marvellously blent.\nSpring flowers huddling under friendly trees, \nAnd close-mown lawns and sleeping bastions, \nWide, coloured wolds and quiet villages, \nAnd summer nights with distant undertones, \nChildren at play, taken in glad surprise, \nAnd modest lovers and their shy caress, \nAnd beautiful, true women\u2019s peaceful eyes\u2014\nO England, richly stored with loveliness! \nYou send your sons to strive for humankind; \nProudly I go-and leave my heart behind."}
