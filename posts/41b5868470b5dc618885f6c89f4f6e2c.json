{"subject": "The Fury Of Earth", "text": "The day of fire is coming, the thrush, \nwill fly ablaze like a little sky rocket, \nthe beetle will sink like a giant bulldozer, \nand at the breaking of the morning the houses \nwill turn into oil and will in their tides \nof fire be a becoming and an ending, a red fan. \nWhat then, man in your easy chair, \nof the anointment of the sick, \nof the New Jerusalem? \nYou will have to polish up the stars \nwith Bab-o and find a new God \nas the earth empties out \ninto the gnarled hands of the old redeemer."}
