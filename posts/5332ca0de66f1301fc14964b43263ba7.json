{"subject": "Baby's Way", "text": "If baby only wanted to, he could fly up to heaven this moment.\n    It is not for nothing that he does not leave us.\n    He loves to rest his head on mother's bosom, and cannot ever\nbear to lose sight of her.\n    Baby know all manner of wise words, though few on earth can\nunderstand their meaning.\n    It is not for nothing that he never wants to speak.\n    The one thing he wants is to learn mother's words from\nmother's lips. That is why he looks so innocent.\n    Baby had a heap of gold and pearls, yet he came like a beggar\non to this earth.\n    It is not for nothing he came in such a disguise.\n    This dear little naked mendicant pretends to be utterly\nhelpless, so that he may beg for mother's wealth of love.\n    Baby was so free from every tie in the land of the tiny\ncrescent moon.\n    It was not for nothing he gave up his freedom.\n    He knows that there is room for endless joy in mother's little\ncorner of a heart, and it is sweeter far than liberty to be caught\nand pressed in her dear arms.\n    Baby never knew how to cry. He dwelt in the land of perfect\nbliss.\n    It is not for nothing he has chosen to shed tears.\n    Though with the smile of his dear face he draws mother's\nyearning heart to him, yet his little cries over tiny troubles\nweave the double bond of pity and love."}
