{"subject": "Monday Morning", "text": "I\n\nI look from the daffodils to where a shelf of books\nGathers the imagination in the shadowed past,\nThe calf-bound brain-cells blooming in the dark\nAll seasons, as the light of a mind illuminates them.\n\nWhy should I take one down when the daffodils\nSpread light in the living brain-cells? Why require \nIllumination out of the dark while the sun shines\nAnd the ducks and the waterhens are diving in the park?\n\nII\n\nPerhaps there are no realities and the sweetness of snow\nLike sugar, is a theorem of shapes in space;\nBut the cubes and the hexagons know where to go\nBecause they are space, bent round itself and ordered \nLike the single thread in lace\u2026"}
