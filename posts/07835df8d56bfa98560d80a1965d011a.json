{"subject": "Terrible Rhymes, Unmanageable Problems (12/15/09)", "text": "trying to find the reasons i cry\nsearching my pocket dictionary\nhow pathetic it is, still i wonder why\nand how will descriptions even help me? \n\ni will never know how much pain they all see\ni will never know the inner workings of my mind\ni can't understand why it all ends at him\nhow much pain do i successfully hide? \n\nand we aren't the only ones who die in the winter\nwe aren't as lonely as you think\nthe stars are all dead, or are hybernating\neither way they disappear when you blink\n\nthey return a season later\nand even though they reappear in the spring\nyou remember each year when they left you before\nthey become less and less warm welcoming\n\nand this poem doesn't feel as fluent as i wish\nbut i can't put the words together\ni want to explain the way that i feel\nby my phrasing, though, my emotions don't seem major\n\nfree me from my unendurable pain\nfree me from this terrible situation\nand when the lights go out and i'm home with them alone\nno one will ever be able to know what happens"}
