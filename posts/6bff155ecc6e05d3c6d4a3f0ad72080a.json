{"subject": "My Mind To Me A Kingdom Is", "text": "My mind to me a kingdom is;\n       Such perfect joy therein I find\n   That it excels all other bliss\n       Which God or nature hath assign'd.\n   Though much I want that most would have,\n   Yet still my mind forbids to crave.\n\n   No princely port, nor wealthy store,\n       No force to win a victory,\n   No wily wit to salve a sore,\n      No shape to win a loving eye;\n  To none of these I yield as thrall,--\n  For why? my mind despise them all.\n\n  I see that plenty surfeit oft,\n      And hasty climbers soonest fall;\n  I see that such as are aloft\n      Mishap doth threaten most of all.\n  These get with toil and keep with fear;\n  Such cares my mind can never bear.\n\n  I press to bear no haughty sway,\n      I wish no more than may suffice,\n  I do no more than well I may,\n      Look, what I want my mind supplies.\n  Lo ! thus I triumph like a king,\n  My mind content with anything.\n\n  I laugh not at another's loss,\n      Nor grudge not at another's gain;\n  No worldly waves my mind can toss;\n      I brook that is another's bane.\n  I fear no foe, nor fawn on friend,\n  I loathe not life, nor dread mine end.\n\n  My wealth is health and perfect ease,\n      And conscience clear my chief defence;\n  I never seek by bribes to please,\n      Nor by desert to give offence.\n  Thus do I live, thus will I die,--\n  Would all did so as well as I!"}
