{"subject": "RAPINDER SLIPS INTO TONGUE", "text": "Dad and me were watching the video -\n\u2018Amar, Akbar, Anthony'. It's about three \nbrothers separated after the family is parted \nby gangsters. You can get it with subtitles, Miss. \nWhen Anthony, who grows up in a Catholic home,\nbegged Christ for the address of his real parents \nthen crossed himself, I jumped off our royal red \nsofa, joined Anthony with his prayer: \nHail Mary, Hail Mary, Hail Mary,\nfour-quartering myself then curtseying a little.\n\nDad just stared at me, knocking his turban side \nto side that I almost thought it would come off\nwhich it normally does when he's doing his press ups \nand his face goes mauve. Instead he took off \nhis flip-flop (the one with a broken thong), \nheld it in the air, shouting in \u2018our' language: \nvut idiot! If you vunt to call on Gud, \ncall anytime on anyvun of our ten gurus. \nDo yoo tink is white Gud's wife yor mudder?\n\nDad's got a seriously funny way Miss,\nsometimes he cries, and says he's going to give me \nto a Sikh school, a proper school. That's why \nI did what my cousin Ashok does at our local\ntemple - while you were all doing Hail Mary \nto end registration, I first locked my hands, \nknelt down, prayed with this ditty we do on Sundays, \nimagined the Golden Temple and our bearded Gods \nto your up-on-the-cross one, then roared: \nWahay Guru! \nWahay Guru!\nWahay Guru! \nLike that."}
