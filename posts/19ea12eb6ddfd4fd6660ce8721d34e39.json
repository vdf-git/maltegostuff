{"subject": "Autumn (Stc)", "text": "Ah! well I know that I shall never find\nThy like this side of Heaven! Well I know\nThat whether on the ways of dream I go,\nOr seek thy semblance with awaken'd mind,\nNaught can avail, and I as well were blind.\nAbout thee lies the summer's afterglow,\nWhere Autumn, lonely in her golden woe,\nHints of its secret with the homeless wind.\n\nTho' Heaven and hope forsake me, still thou art,\nAnd all my memory is made thy throne.\nO lonely in thy loveliness, be true!\nO rose without a sister! Close thy heart!\nTo all but me! Thy memory in mine own\nHides like a tear of everlasting dew."}
