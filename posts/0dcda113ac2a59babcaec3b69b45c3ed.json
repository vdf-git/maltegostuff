{"subject": "Stafford Henry Northcote", "text": "Gentle in fibre, but of steadfast nerve\nStill to do right though right won blame not praise,\nAnd fallen on evil tongues and evil days\nWhen men from plain straight duty twist and swerve,\nAnd, born to nobly sway, ignobly serve,\nSliming their track to power through tortuous ways,\nHe felt, with that fine sense that ne'er betrays,\nThe line of moral beauty's not a curve.\nBut, proving wisdom folly, virtue vain,\nHe stretched his hands out to the other shore,\nAnd was by kindred spirits beckoned o'er\nInto the gloaming Land where setteth pain,\nWhile we across the silent river strain\nIdly our gaze, and find his form no more."}
