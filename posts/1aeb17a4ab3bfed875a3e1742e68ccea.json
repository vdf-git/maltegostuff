{"subject": "Does It Matter?", "text": "Does it matter? -losing your legs? \nFor people will always be kind,\nAnd you need not show that you mind\nWhen others come in after hunting\nTo gobble their muffins and eggs.\nDoes it matter? -losing you sight? \nThere\u2019s such splendid work for the blind; \nAnd people will always be kind,\nAs you sit on the terrace remembering\nAnd turning your face to the light.\nDo they matter-those dreams in the pit? \nYou can drink and forget and be glad,\nAnd people won't say that you\u2019re mad; \nFor they know that you've fought for your country,\nAnd no one will worry a bit."}
