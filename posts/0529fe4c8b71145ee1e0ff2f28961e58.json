{"subject": "The Trust", "text": "We steal the brawn, we steal the brain;\nThe man beneath us in the fight\nSoon learns how helpless and how vain\nTo plead for justice or for right.\nWe steal the youth, we steal the health,\nHope, courage, aspiration high;\nWe steal men's all to make for wealth-\nWe will repent us by and by.\n\nMeantime, a gift will heaven appease-\nGreat God, forgive our charities!\n\nWe steal the children's laughter shrill,\nWe steal their joys e'er they can taste,\n'Why skip like young lambs on a hill?\nGo, get ye to your task in haste.'\nNo matter that they droop and tire,\nThat heaven cries out against the sin,\nThe gold, red gold, that we desire\nTheir dimpled hands must help to win.\n\nA cheque for missions, if you please-\nGreat God, forgive our charities!\n\nWe steal the light from lover's eyes,\nWe hush the tale he has to tell\nOf pure desire, of tender ties-\nNo man can serve two masters well.\nSo loot his treasury of pride,\nHis holy hopes and visions steal,\nHis hearth-fire scatter far and wide,\nAnd grind the sparks beneath your heel.\n\nA cheque will cover sins like these-\nGreat God, forgive our charities!"}
