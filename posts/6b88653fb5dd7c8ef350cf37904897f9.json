{"subject": "For Johnny Pole On The Forgotten Beach", "text": "In his tenth July some instinct\ntaught him to arm the waiting wave,\na giant where its mouth hung open.\nHe rode on the lip that buoyed him there\nand buckled him under. The beach was strung\nwith children paddling their ages in,\nunder the glare od noon chipping\nits light out. He stood up, anonymous\nand straight among them, between\ntheir sand pails and nursery crafts.\nThe breakers cartwheeled in and over\nto puddle their toes and test their perfect\nskin. He was my brother, my small\nJohnny brother, almost ten. We flopped\ndown upon a towel to grind the sand\nunder us and watched the Atlantic sea\nmove fire, like night sparklers;\nand lost our weight in the festival\nseason. He dreamed, he said, to be\na man designed like a balanced wave\u2026\nhow someday he would wait, giant\nand straight.\nJohnny, your dream moves summers\ninside my mind.\nHe was tall and twenty that July,\nbut there was no balance to help;\nonly the shells came straight and even.\nThis was the first beach of assault;\nthe odor of death hung in the air\nlike rotting potatoes, the junkyard\nof landing craft waited open and rusting.\nThe bodies were strung out as if they were\nstill reaching for each other, where they lay\nto blacken, to burst through their perfect\nskin. And Johnny Pole was one of them.\nHe gave in like a small wave, a sudden\nhole in his belly and the years all gone\nwhere the Pacific noon chipped its light out.\nLike a bean bag, outflung, head loose\nand anonymous, he lay. Did the sea move fire\nfor its battle season? Does he lie there\nforever, where his rifle waits, giant\nand straight?\u2026I think you die again\nand live again,\nJohnny, each summer that moves inside\nmy mind."}
