{"subject": "Quite Frankly", "text": "They got old, they got old and died. But first\u2014\nokay but first they composed plangent depictions\nof how much they lost and how much cared about losing.\nMeantime their hair got thin and more thin\nas their shoulders went slumpy. Okay but\n\nnot before the photo albums got arranged by them,\narranged with a niftiness, not just two or three\nbut eighteen photo albums, yes eighteen eventually,\neighteen albums proving the beauty of them (and not someone else),\nthem and their relations and friends, incontrovertible\n\nplaying croquet in that Bloomington yard,\nfloating on those comic inflatables at Dow Lake,\ngiggling at the Dairy Queen, waltzing at the wedding,\nbuilding a Lego palace on the porch,\nholding the baby beside the rental truck,\nleaning on the Hemingway statue at Pamplona,\ndiscussing the eternity of art in that Sardinian restaurant.\n\nYes! And so, quite frankly\u2014at the end of the day\u2014\nthey got old and died okay sure but quite frankly\nhow much does that matter in view of\nthe eighteen photo albums, big ones\nthirteen inches by twelve inches each\nfull of such undeniable beauty?"}
