{"subject": "A Parody", "text": "When first, Philander, first I came\nWhere Avon rolls his winding stream,\nThe nymphs, how brisk, the swains, how gay,\nTo see Asteria, queen of May!\nThe parsons round her praises sung!\nThe steeples with her praises rung!-\nI thought no sight that e'er was seen\nCould match the sight of Barel's Green!\n\nBut now, since old Eugenio died-\nThe chief of poets, and the pride-\nNow, meaner bards in vain aspire\nTo raise their voice, to tune their lyre!\nTheir lovely season now is o'er;\nThy notes, Florelio, please no more!\nNor more Asteria's smiles are seen-\nAdieu!-the sweets of Barel's Green!"}
