{"subject": "Why A Poem", "text": "Unfazed you stand in\u2015 \na drizzle, to locate the \nmoon nestling in clouds.  \n\nThe speed of bite was fatal, \nshowing the movement \nof incompleteness.       \n\nI searched the identity\u2015\nof one anonymous, who \nhad fathered an illegitimate eunuch.\n\nI wanted to make a \nconfession, looking at the \nblue sky, about my waywardness.\n\nThe crazy thing of mixing \nthe flowers, winds, moon and birds \nwith serious chores of life.\n\nUnmistakingly a poem."}
