{"subject": "Mirage", "text": "The footfalls of many feet are on the prairies, \nTreading softly, like the rustling of shaken grasses; \nIn the air about me is a sound scarce audible, \nAs of the wings of silent birds, low-flying. . . . \n\nWhat are they that move in the luminous mid-day, \nInvisibly, intangibly? . . . \n\nIt is hot and whisperingly still; \nI see only the quivering air, there on the far horizon, \nAnd beyond it a lake of cool water lifted into the sky: \nPleasant groves are growing beside it, \nVery distant I see them. . . . \n\nAre these men come out of the silence to walk beside me? \nAre these gods who flit with invisible wings?"}
