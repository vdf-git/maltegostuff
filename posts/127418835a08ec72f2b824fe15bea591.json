{"subject": "Out With The World", "text": "I'm out with all the world to-day,\nSo all the world to me is grey,\nAh me! the bonny world.\nGlad birds are building in the tree,\nFor them I have no sympathy;\nFrom out the grove a thrush pipes clear,\nI have no wish his song to hear;\nFrom tangled boughs that young buds share\nWith last year's leaves, a startled hare\nA moment peeps and then away;\nI have no laughter for his play,\nFor all the sunny sky is grey,\nThe weariest I am to-day\nIn all the weary world\n\nPerchance to-morrow's hidden store\nMay bring my heart's content once more,\nThe sweet young spring comes very fair\nWith summer's breath and golden air;\nAnd I may think there cannot be\nA maid so blessed on land or sea.\nI'm out, though, with the world to-day,\nSo all the world to me is grey,\nAh me! the bonny world."}
