{"subject": "Elegy", "text": "SIGH not, ye winds, as passing o'er\nThe chambers of the dead you fly;\nWeep not, ye dews, for these no more\nShall ever weep, shall ever sigh.\nWhy mourn the throbbing heart at rest?\nHow still it lies within the breast!\nWhy mourn, since death presents us peace,\nAnd in the grave our sorrows cease?\nThe shatter'd bark, from adverse winds,\nRest in this peaceful haven finds;\nAnd, when the storms of life are past,\nHope drops her anchor here at last.\nSigh not, ye winds, as passing o'er\nThe chambers of the dead you fly;\nWeep not, ye dews, for these no more\nShall ever weep, shall ever sigh."}
