{"subject": "Points And Lines", "text": "Instants in the quiet, small sharp stars,\n    Pierce my spirit with a thrust whose speed\n    Baffles even the grasp of time.\n    Oh that I might reflect them\n    As swiftly, as keenly as they shine.\n    But I am a pool of waters, summer-still,\n    And the stars are mirrored across me;\n    Those stabbing points of the sky\n    Turned to a thread of shaken silver,\n    A long fine thread."}
