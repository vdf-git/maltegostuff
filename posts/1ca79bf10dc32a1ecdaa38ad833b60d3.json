{"subject": "Roland", "text": "A FOOLISH creature full of fears, \nHe trembled for his fate, \nAnd stood aghast to feel the earth \nSwing round her dizzy freight. \n\nWith timid foot he touched each plan, \nSure that each plan would fail; \nBehemoth's tread was his, it seemed, \nAnd every bridge too frail. \n\nNo glory of the night or day \nLit any crown for him, \nThe tranquil past but breathed a mist \nTo make the future dim. \n\nThe world, his birthright, seemed a cell, \nAn iron heritage; \nMan, a trapped creature, left to die \nForgotten in his cage. \n\nIn every dark he held his breath, \nAnd warded off a blow; \nWhile at his shoulder still he sought \nSome tagging ghost of woe. \n\nSpying the thorns but not the flowers, \nThrough all the blossoming land \nHe hugged his careful heart and shunned \nThe path on either hand. \n\nThe buds that broke their hearts to give \nNew odors to the air \nHe saw not; but he caught the scent \nOf dead leaves everywhere. \n\nTill on a day he came to know \nHe had not made the world; \nThat if he slept, as when he ran, \nEach onward planet whirled. \n\nHe knew not where the vision fell, \nOnly all things grew plain\u2014 \nAs if some thatch broke through and let \nA sunbeam cross his brain. \n\nIn beauty flushed the morning light, \nWith blessing dropped the rain, \nAll creatures were to him most fair, \nNor anything in vain. \n\nHe breathed the space that links the stars, \nHe rested on God's arm\u2014 \nA man unmoved by accident, \nUntouched by any harm. \n\nThe weary doubt if all is good, \nThe doubt if all is ill, \nHe left to Him who leaves to us \nTo know that all is well."}
