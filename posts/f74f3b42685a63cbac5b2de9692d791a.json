{"subject": "Lilacs for Ginsberg", "text": "I was most interested in what they looked like dead\nand I could learn to love them so I waited\nfor three or four days until the brown set in\nand there was a certain reverse curl to the leaf by\nwhich in putting my finger on the main artery\nbeside the throat I knew the blood had passed on\nto someplace else and he was talking to two\ndemons from the afterlife although it was\njust like the mountains in New York State since there was\nsmoke in the sky and they were yelping and he was\nspeaking in his telltale New Jersey English\nand saying the same thing over and over the way he\ndid when he was on stage and his white shirt was\nperfect and the lack of air and of light\naged the lilacs but he was sitting on a lily\nin one or two seconds and he forgot about Eighth Street\nand fame and cancer and bent down to pick a loose\ndiamond but more important than that he talked\nto the demons in French and sang with his tinny voice\nnor did he go on about his yellowing sickness\nbut counted the clusters and said they were only stars\nand there were two universes intertwined, the\nwhite and the purple, or they were just crumbs or specks\nthat he could sprinkle on his pie nor could he\nexactly remember his sorrow except when he pressed\nthe lilacs to his face or when he stooped\nto bury himself in the bush, then for a moment\nhe almost did, for lilacs clear the mind\nand all the elaborations are possible in their\ndear smell and even his death which was so\ngood and thoughtful became, for a moment, sorrowful."}
