{"subject": "The Castle In Austria", "text": "From 'The Boy's Wonderhorn'\n\nThere lies a castle in Austria,\nRight goodly to behold,\nWalled tip with marble stones so fair,\nWith silver and with red gold.\n\nTherein lies captive a young boy,\nFor life and death he lies bound,\nFull forty fathoms under the earth,\n'Midst vipers and snakes around.\n\nHis father came from Rosenberg,\nBefore the tower he went:--\n'My son, my dearest son, how hard\nIs thy imprisonment!'\n\n'O father, dearest father mine,\nSo hardly I am bound,\nFull forty fathoms under the earth,\n'Midst vipers and snakes around!'\n\nHis father went before the lord:--\n'Let loose thy captive to me!\nI have at home three casks of gold,\nAnd these for the boy I'll gi'e.'\n\n'Three casks of gold, they help you not:\nThat boy, and he must die!\nHe wears round his neck a golden chain;\nTherein doth his ruin lie.'\n\n'And if he thus wear a golden chain,\nHe hath not stolen it; nay!\nA maiden good gave it to him\nFor true love, did she say.'\n\nThey led the boy forth from the tower,\nAnd the sacrament took he:--\n'Help thou, rich Christ, from heaven high,\nIt's come to an end with me!'\n\nThey led him to the scaffold place,\nUp the ladder he must go:--\n'O headsman, dearest headsman, do\nBut a short respite allow!'\n\n'A short respite I must not grant;\nThou wouldst escape and fly:\nReach me a silken handkerchief\nAround his eyes to tie.'\n\n'Oh, do not, do not bind mine eyes!\nI must look on the world so fine;\nI see it to-day, then never more,\nWith these weeping eyes of mine.'\n\nHis father near the scaffold stood,\nAnd his heart, it almost rends:--\n'O son, O thou my dearest son,\nThy death I will avenge!'\n\n'O father, dearest father mine!\nMy death thou shalt not avenge:\n'Twould bring to my soul but heavy pains;\nLet me die in innocence.\n\n'It is not for this life of mine,\nNor for my body proud;\n'Tis but for my dear mother's sake:\nAt home she weeps aloud.'\n\nNot yet three days had passed away,\nWhen an angel from heaven came down:\n'Take ye the boy from the scaffold away;\nElse the city shall sink under ground!'\n\nAnd not six months had passed away,\nEre his death was avenged amain;\nAnd upwards of three hundred men\nFor the boy's life were slain.\n\nWho is it that hath made this lay,\nHath sung it, and so on?\nThat, in Vienna in Austria,\nThree maidens fair have done."}
