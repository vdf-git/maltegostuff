{"subject": "I-Breasil", "text": "There is a way I am fain to go\u2013\nTo the mystical land where all are young,\nWhere the silver branches have buds of snow.\nAnd every leaf is a singing tongue. \n\nIt lies beyond the night and day,\nOver shadowy hill, and moorland wide,\nAnd whoso enters casts care away,\nAnd wistful longings unsatisfied. \n\nThere arc sweet white women, a radiant throng\nSwaying like flowers in a scented wind:\nBut between us the veil of earth is strong,\nAnd my eyes to their luring eyes are blind. \n\nA blossom of fire is each beauteous bird,\nScarlet and gold on melodious wings,\nAnd never so haunting a strain was heard\nFrom royal harp in the Hall of Kings. \n\nThe sacred trees stand in rainbow dew,\nApple and ash and the twisted thorn,\nQuicken and holly and dusky yew,\nAncient ere ever gray Time was born. \n\nThe oak spreads mighty beneath the sun\nIn a wonderful dazzle of moonlight green\u2013\nO would I might hasten from tasks undone,\nAnd journey whither no grief hath been! \n\nWere I past the mountains of opal flame,\nI would seek a couch of the king-fern brown,\nAnd when from its seed glad slumber came,\nA flock of rare dreams would flutter down. \n\nBut I move without in an endless fret,\nWhile somewhere beyond earth's brink, afar,\nForgotten of men, in a rose-rim set,\nI-Breasil shines like a beckoning star."}
