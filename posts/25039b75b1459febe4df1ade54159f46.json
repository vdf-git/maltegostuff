{"subject": "Sonnet Liii:  Without Her", "text": "What of her glass without her? The blank grey\nThere where the pool is blind of the moon's face.\nHer dress without her? The tossed empty space\nOf cloud-rack whence the moon has passed away.\nHer paths without her? Day's appointed sway\nUsurped by desolate night. Her pillowed place\nWithout her? Tears, ah me! for love's good grace,\nAnd cold forgetfulness of night or day.\nWhat of the heart without her? Nay, poor heart,\nOf thee what word remains ere speech be still?\nA wayfarer by barren ways and chill,\nSteep ways and weary, without her thou art,\nWhere the long cloud, the long wood's counterpart,\nSheds doubled darkness up the labouring hill."}
