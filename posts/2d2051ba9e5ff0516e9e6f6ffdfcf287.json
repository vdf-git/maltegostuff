{"subject": "THE GYRE", "text": "The world was a globe that sat on a table\nin a fire-lit study, the table covered\nwith a rich, tooled leather; while\nthe man who spun the globe\u2014matching\ncountries with the map spread out below\non the desk from which he reached\nan arm to turn the little effigy of world\u2014\nwas shifting borders in his head, so that\nthe spinning orb began to glow\nwith his desire, his designs. As if his dreams\nhad given off a smoke, a thick fog\ncloaked and altered everything he saw\u2014\n\nso even now, when all the corpses from that spin\nhave long since rotted in the grave,\nthe clouds have not dispersed, their swirling\nsmoke obscures all but the twisted steel\nof a foregone conclusion, the world unmade,\nas centuries and cities fall, cascade\ninto the landfill of history\u2014worlds born\non the waste of those that came before.\nAs a glowing cloud of smoke will hang\nover a burning dump at night, and the bears\nand raccoons come out, eyes shining in the dark,\nto paw through the smoldering heaps\u2014\njust so the historian sits, sifting and sifting\nentrails, cornices, motives, bones\u2014all\nthat is left to be indexed and filed,\nrearranged, given syntax and sense;\nabove him, stuffed birds\u2014a condor, a gull,\na carrion crow, moth-eaten by time,\nlook down on his labors\nwith a bright, glassy-eyed rancor\nfrom their dusty cases, and,\nstirring a little on their perches, try\nwith beaks their walls of glass:\nhere and there now, hairline cracks,\nand as night falls, the sound of taps."}
