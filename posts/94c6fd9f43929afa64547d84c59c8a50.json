{"subject": "Hungriness Dancing On A Plate", "text": "One dark stormy night\n pained by a village site\n I saw in one house\n Hungriness dancing on a plate\n and two full moons playing around inside.\n Mother put fire on to cook a little rice\n begged from the village\n from sunrise to sunset\n that was their most valuable asset\n The moons ask the mother and father,\n \"we are hungry, give us food\"\n Father replied wait a little bit\n Mother said with tearful eyes\n Don't cry, after a few minutes\n it will be alright.\n The moons are silent and quiet\n But my voice rose up and roaring toward the God\n \"Why and how the difference you make, one\n is full of food and wealth, another not even\n getting a bite.\n Let me know, let me know\n oh my God,\n \"Is it really justified?\""}
