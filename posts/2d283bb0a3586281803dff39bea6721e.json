{"subject": "Brethren Of The Boat", "text": "WHEN some of the ancient lineage prate\nWe brothers listen with a smile,\nWe do not boast ancestral state,\nIt really is n\u2019t worth our while,\nSince all must know that we can trace\n\nOur line to ages so remote\nAs when Pa Noah gave a place\nTo none but brethren of his boat.\n\nIn that old world where sin was rife,\nHow natural that the only man\n\nFound worthy of continuing life\nWas one who\u2019d lived on such a plan\nThat when the earth was all submerged\nHe knew the way to go afloat\nAnd save\u2014the point is once more urged\u2014\n\nOur line, the Brethren of the Boat.\n\nSince then our long immortal scroll\nHas blazed with names of Men of Might,\nJason, Ulysses, on the roll\nWith C\u00e6sar, and with Wallace wight;\n\nFrom age to age, on every shore,\nWho raised the strong triumphant note\nIf not the Vikings of the Oar,\nWe, tuggers, Brethren of the Boat?\n\nWho holds the keys of Heaven and Hell\nAnd Purgatory in his hand?\nA boating man\u2014and does it well\u2014\nSt. Peter, so we understand!\nWhere were the first Apostles found?\u2014\nSure, every child knows this by rote\u2014 \nAmongst the men whose hearts be sound,\nThe virtuous Brethren of the Boat.\n\nIt may be false, yet some contend\nThat when to other spheres men go,\nThe judgment of their final end\nHangs on the question, Did he row?\nBut this is sure,\u2014on us at last\nOld Father Charon\u2019s eyes will doat,\nAs o\u2019er the Styx he ferries fast\nHis comrade Brethren of the Boat."}
