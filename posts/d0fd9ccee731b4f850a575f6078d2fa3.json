{"subject": "Unity In Space", "text": "Take me away into a storm of snow\nSo white and soft, I feel no deathly chill,\nBut listen to the murmuring overflow\nOf clouds that fall in many a frosty rill!\n\nTake me away into the sunset's glow,\nThat holds a summer in a glorious bloom;\nOr take me to the shadowed woods that grow\nOn the sky's mountains, in the evening gloom!\n\nGive me an entrance to the limpid lake\nWhen moonbeams shine across its purity!\nA life there is, within the life we take\nSo commonly, for which 't were well to die."}
