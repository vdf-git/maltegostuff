{"subject": "Catharina : The Second Part. On Her Marriage To George Courtenay, Esq.", "text": "Believe it or not, as you choose,\nThe doctrine is certainly true,\nThat the future is known to the Muse,\nAnd poets are oracles too.\nI did but express a desire,\nTo see Catharina at home, \nAt the side of my friend George's fire,\nAnd lo -- she is actually come.\n\nSuch prophecy some may despise,\nBut the wish of a poet and friend\nPerhaps is approved in the skies,\nAnd therefore attains to its end.\n'Twas a wish that flew ardently forth\nFrom a bosom effectually warmed \nWith the talents, the graces, and worth \nOf the person for whom it was formed.\n\nMaria would leave us, I knew,\nTo the grief and regret of us all,\nBut less to our grief, could we view\nCatharina the queen of the hall.\nAnd therefore I wished as I did,\nAnd therefore this union of hands;\nNot a whisper was heard to forbid,\nBut all cry, Amen! to the bans.\n\nSince therefore I seem to incur \nNo danger of wishing in vain,\nWhen making good wishes for her,\nI will e'en to my wishes again;\nWith one I have made her a wife,\nAnd now I will try with another,\nWhich I cannot suppress for my life,\nHow soon I can make her a mother."}
