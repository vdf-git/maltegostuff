{"subject": "Bkiii:Viii Celebration", "text": "You, an expert in prose in either language,\nwonder what I, a bachelor, am doing\non the Kalends of March, what do the flowers mean,\nthe box of incense,\n\nand the embers laid out on the fresh cut turf.\nI vowed sweet meats to Bacchus, vowed a pure white\ngoat, at that time when I was so nearly killed\nby a falling tree.\n\nWhen this festive day returns again I\u2019ll draw\na tight-fitting cork, sealed with pitch, from a jar\nlaid down to gather the dust in that year when\nTullus was Consul.\n\nSo drink a whole gallon of wine, Maecenas,\ncelebrating your friend\u2019s escape, and we\u2019ll quench\nthe flickering lamps at dawn: keep far away\nthe noise and anger.\n\nLeave the cares of state behind in the City:\nCotiso\u2019s Dacian army\u2019s been destroyed,\nthe dangerous Medes are fighting each other,\nin grievous battle,\n\nour old Cantabrian enemies are slaves,\nsubdued, in chains, at last, on the Spanish coast,\nand now the Scythians, their bows unstrung, plan\nto give up their plains.\n\nA private citizen for now, don\u2019t worry\nyourself, overmuch, what troubles the people,\nand gladly accept the gifts of the moment,\nand forget dark things."}
