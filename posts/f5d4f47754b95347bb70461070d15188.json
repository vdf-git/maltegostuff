{"subject": "Olney Hymn 44: Submission", "text": "O Lord, my best desire fulfil, \nAnd help me to resign \nLife, health, and comfort to Thy will, \nAnd make Thy pleasure mine. \n\nWhy whould I shrink at Thy command, \nWhose love forbids my fears? \nOr tremble at the gracious hand \nThat wipes away my tears? \n\nNo, rather let me freely yield \nWhat most I prize to Thee; \nWho never hast a good withheld, \nOr wilt withhold, from me. \n\nThy favor, all my journey through, \nThou art engaged to grant; \nWhat else I want, or think I do, \n'Tis better still to want. \n\nWisdom and mercy guide my way, \nShall I resist them both? \nA poor blind creature of day, \nAnd crush'd before the moth! \n\nBut ah! my inward spirit cries, \nStill binds me to Thy sway; \nElse the next cloud that veils the skies \nDrives all these thoughts away."}
