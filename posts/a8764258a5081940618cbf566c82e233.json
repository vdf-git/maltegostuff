{"subject": "The Rout Of The White Hussars", "text": "It was not in the open fight\nWe threw away the sword,\nBut in the lonely watching\nIn the darkness by the ford.\nThe waters lapped, the night-wind blew,\nFull-armed the Fear was born and grew,\nAnd we were flying ere we knew\nFrom panic in the night."}
