{"subject": "It Is March", "text": "It is March and black dust falls out of the books\nSoon I will be gone\nThe tall spirit who lodged here has\nLeft already\nOn the avenues the colorless thread lies under\nOld prices\n\nWhen you look back there is always the past\nEven when it has vanished\nBut when you look forward\nWith your dirty knuckles and the wingless\nBird on your shoulder\nWhat can you write\n\nThe bitterness is still rising in the old mines\nThe fist is coming out of the egg\nThe thermometers out of the mouths of the corpses\n\nAt a certain height\nThe tails of the kites for a moment are\nCovered with footsteps\n\nWhatever I have to do has not yet begun"}
