{"subject": "To The Muse Of The North", "text": "O muse that swayest the sad Northern Song,\nThy right hand full of smiting &amp; of wrong,\nThy left hand holding pity; &amp; thy breast\nHeaving with hope of that so certain rest:\nThou, with the grey eyes kind and unafraid,\nThe soft lips trembling not, though they have said\nThe doom of the World and those that dwell therein.\nThe lips that smile not though thy children win\nThe fated Love that draws the fated Death.\nO, borne adown the fresh stream of thy breath,\nLet some word reach my ears and touch my heart,\nThat, if it may be, I may have a part\nIn that great sorrow of thy children dead\nThat vexed the brow, and bowed adown the head,\nWhitened the hair, made life a wondrous dream,\nAnd death the murmur of a restful stream,\nBut left no stain upon those souls of thine\nWhose greatness through the tangled world doth shine.\nO Mother, and Love and Sister all in one,\nCome thou; for sure I am enough alone\nThat thou thine arms about my heart shouldst throw,\nAnd wrap me in the grief of long ago."}
