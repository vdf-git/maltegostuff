{"subject": "Vigil", "text": "In the hollow of pale night upon the moor\nThe silence blows a perfume: O but hark!\nA sound is in the bosom of the dark,\nBreathed like a secret from the glimmering shore;\nA vigil of unearthly sound, the sea\nThat never slumbers and begins anew,\nAnd melts into our hearts amid the dew,\nMurmuring on the moor to you and me.\n\nOut of a silence dateless as the old earth,\nBefore ear heard or ever voice could frame\nSpeech, or the human dearness of a name,\nTo glorify man's longing or his mirth,\nEre ever any place was historied\nFor hearts that sever yet their own home keep,\nThat sound comes immemorial like sleep\nFresh, with the morning in dark softness hid.\n\nO Love, O Love, were we not there, we too,\nIn far nights and wild silences? Were we\nNot part of this old secret of the sea?\nFor O your kiss, thrilling my body through,\nTouches me from eternity, as if I\nAnd you were of the things before Time came\nTo measure men's desire and loss and shame,\nAnd no use disenchants this mystery."}
