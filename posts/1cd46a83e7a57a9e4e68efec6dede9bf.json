{"subject": "In The Harbour: Decoration Day", "text": "Sleep, comrades, sleep and rest\nOn this Field of the Grounded Arms,\nWhere foes no more molest,\nNor sentry's shot alarms! \n\nYe have slept on the ground before,\nAnd started to your feet\nAt the cannon's sudden roar,\nOr the drum's redoubling beat. \n\nBut in this camp of Death\nNo sound your slumber breaks;\nHere is no fevered breath,\nNo wound that bleeds and aches. \n\nAll is repose and peace,\nUntrampled lies the sod;\nThe shouts of battle cease,\nIt is the Truce of God! \n\nRest, comrades, rest and sleep!\nThe thoughts of men shall be\nAs sentinels to keep\nYour rest from danger free. \n\nYour silent tents of green\nWe deck with fragrant flowers;\nYours has the suffering been,\nThe memory shall be ours."}
