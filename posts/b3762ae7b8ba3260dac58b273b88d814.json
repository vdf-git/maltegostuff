How the worst of them\ndrink their jam and water\n\nand take off their clothes.\nIt's clear to everyone. Except you. You're not from here. \nImplying, without shame.\n\nThat must be because it's so slowly. So little\nby little. But I've already told you.\nI look at the beautiful men. Today my life is just like that."}
