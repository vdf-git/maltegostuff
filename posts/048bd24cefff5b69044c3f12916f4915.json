{"subject": "The Boy", "text": "Go, little boy, \nFill thee with joy; \nFor Time gives thee \nUnlicensed hours, \nTo run in fields, \nAnd roll in flowers.\n\nA little boy \nCan life enjoy; \nIf but to see \nThe horses pass, \nWhen shut indoors \nBehind the glass.\n\nGo, little boy, \nFill thee with joy; \nFear not, like man, \nThe kick of wrath, \nThat you do lie \nIn some one's path.\n\nTime is to thee \nEternity, \nAs to a bird \nOr butterfly; \nAnd in that faith \nTrue joy doth lie."}
