{"subject": "Touch Me - Feel Me", "text": "Walking through the wood, on a rainy day \nLooking at the sky through beautiful clouds, \nSome are white, and some are dark, \nTalking with each other in a thunder sound! \nTouch me - feel me. \nFeeling like touching deep inside cloud, \nSofter than a cotton and smoother like a silk, \nRose petals are more softer but \nbaby's cheeks are softer than all. \nTouch me - feel me \nHuman heart is more delicate and softer than all \nBut feelings are the most delicate and \nsoftest that all above. \nBecause once they are hurt can't be \nmended or repaired, remains deep \ninside the heart but never forgotten. \nTouch me - feel me."}
