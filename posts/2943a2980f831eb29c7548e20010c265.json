{"subject": "The Sinless Child Part 6", "text": "'Tis the summer prime, when the noiseless air\nIn perfumed chalice lies,\nAnd the bee goes by with a lazy hum,\nBeneath the sleeping skies:\nWhen the brook is low, and the ripples bright,\nAs down the stream they go;\nThe pebbles are dry on the upper side,\nAnd dark and wet below.\n\nThe tree that stood where the soil's athirst,\nAnd the mulleins first appear,\nHath a dry and rusty-colored bark.\nAnd its leaves are curled and sere;\nBut the dog-wood and the hazel bush,\nHave clustered round the brook\u2014\nTheir roots have stricken deep beneath,\nAnd they have a verdant look.\n\nTo the juicy leaf the grasshopper clings,\nAnd he gnaws it like a file,\nThe naked stalks are withering by,\nWhere he has been erewhile.\nThe cricket hops on the glistering rock,\nOr pipes in the faded grass,\nThe beetle's wing is folded mute,\nWhere the steps of the idler pass.\n\nThe widow donned her russet robe,\nHer cap of snowy hue,\nAnd o'er her staid maternal form\nA sober mantle threw;\nAnd she, while fresh the morning light,\nHath gone to pass the day,\nAnd ease an ailing neighbor's pain\nAcross the meadow way.\n\nYoung Eva closed the cottage-door;\nAnd wooed by bird and flower,\nShe loitered on beneath the wood,\nTill came the noon-tide hour.\nThe sloping bank is cool and green,\nBeside the sparkling rill;\nThe cloud that slumbers in the sky,\nIs painted on the hill.\n\nThe spirits poised their purple wings\nO'er blossom, brook, and dell,\nAnd lingered in the quiet nook,\nAs if they loved it well.\nYoung Eva laid one snowy arm\nUpon a violet bank,\nAnd pillowed there her downy cheek,\nWhile she to slumber sank.\n\nA smile is on her gentle lip,\nFor she the angels saw,\nAnd felt their wings a covert make\nAs round her head they draw.\nA maiden's sleep, how pure it is!\nThe innocent repose\nThat knows no dark nor troublous dream,\nNor love's wild waking knows!\n\nA huntsman's whistle; and anon\nThe dogs come fawning round,\nAnd now they raise the pendent ear,\nAnd crouch along the ground.\nThe hunter leaped the shrunken brook,\nThe dogs hold back with awe,\nFor they upon the violet bank\nThe slumbering maiden saw.\n\nA reckless youth was Albert Linne,\nWith licensed oath and jest,\nWho little cared for woman's fame,\nOr peaceful maiden rest.\nLight things to him, were broken vows\u2014\nThe blush, the sigh, the tear;\nWhat hinders he should steal a kiss,\nFrom sleeping damsel here?\n\nHe looks, yet stays his eager foot;\nFor, on that spotless brow,\nAnd that closed lid, a something rests\nHe never saw till now;\nHe gazes, yet he shrinks with awe\nFrom that fair wondrous face,\nThose limbs so quietly disposed,\nWith more than maiden grace.\n\nHe seats himself upon the bank,\nAnd turns his face away,\nAnd Albert Linne, the hair-brained youth,\nWished in his heart to pray.\nHe looked within his very soul,\nIts hidden chamber saw,\nInscribed with records dark and deep\nOf many a broken law.\n\nFor thronging came his former life,\nWhat once he called delight,\nThe goblet, oath, and stolen joy,\nHow palled they on his sight!\nNo more he thinks of maiden fair,\nNo more of ravished kiss.\nForgets he that pure sleeper nigh\nHath brought his thoughts to this!\n\nUnwonted thought it was for him\nWhose eager stirring life,\nPanted for action and renown,\nHigh deeds and daring strife;\nWho scorning times of work-day zeal\nWhen thought may power impart;\nIn manly pastime sought to quell,\nThe beatings of his heart.\n\nUnwonted thought, unwonted calm,\nUpon his spirit fell;\nFor he unwittingly had sought\nYoung Eva's hallowed dell,\nAnd breathed that atmosphere of love.\nAround her path that grew;\nThat evil from her steps repelled,\nThe good unto her drew.\n\nNow Eva opes her child-like eyes,\nAnd lifts her tranquil head;\nAnd Albert, like a guilty thing,\nHad from her presence fled.\nBut Eva marked his troubled brow,\nHis sad and thoughtful eyes,\nAs if they sought, yet shrank to hold\nTheir converse with the skies.\n\nAnd all her kindly nature stirred,\nShe prayed him to remain;\nWell conscious that the pure have power\nTo balm much human pain.\nThere mingled too, as in a dream,\nAbout brave Albert Linne,\nA real and ideal form.\nHer soul had framed within.\n\nAnd he whose ready jest had met\nThe worldling in her pride,\nFelt all his reckless nature hushed,\nBy hallowed Eva's side;\nAnd when she held her wavy hand,\nAnd bade him stay awhile;\nHe looked into her sinless eyes,\nAnd marked her child-like smile:\n\nAnd that so pure and winning beamed,\nSo calm and holy too,\nThat o'er his troubled thoughts at once\nA quiet charm it threw.\nLight thought, light words were all forgot,\nHe breathed a holier air,\nHe felt the power of womanhood\u2014\nIts purity was there.\n\nAnd soft beneath their silken fringe\nBeamed Eva's dovelike eyes,\nThat seemed to claim a sisterhood,\nWith something in the skies.\nHer gentle voice a part became\nOf air, and brook, and bird,\nAnd Albert listened, as if he\nSuch music only heard.\n\nO Eva! thou the pure in heart,\nWhy falls thy trembling voice?\nA blush is on thy maiden cheek,\nAnd yet thine eyes rejoice.\nAnother glory wakes for thee,\nWhere'er thine eyes may rest;\nAnd deeper, holier thoughts arise\nWithin thy peaceful breast.\n\nThine eyelids droop in tenderness,\nNew smiles thy lips combine,\nFor thou dost feel another soul\nIs blending into thine.\nThou upward raisest thy meek eyes,\nAnd it is sweet to thee;\nTo feel the weakness of thy sex,\nIs more than majesty.\n\nTo feel thy shrinking nature claim\nThe stronger arm and brow;\nThy weapons, smiles, and tears, and prayers,\nAnd blushes such as now.\nA woman, gentle Eva, thou,\nThy lot were incomplete,\nDid not all sympathies of soul\nWithin thy being meet.\n\nBut Faith was thine, the angel gift,\nAnd Love untouched by earth,\nFor Albert was the crown affixed\nTo thine immortal birth;\nAnd not for thee the heavy pangs\nOf those, who, doomed by fate,\nLearn, through the lapse of weary years,\nTo love, to watch, and wait.\n\nOh not for thee for such as thee,\nTo tremble with dismay,\nLest baser hands pollute thy crown,\nAnd rieve its light away.\nOh not for thee, the anguished prayer,\nThe struggle long and late,\nThe pleading of the still small voice,\nThat bids thee trust and wait.\n\nThou didst o'er-step this fleeting space,\nAnd grasp the higher world;\nAnd angel-like thy pinions here,\nTheir glory half unfurled.\nAll evil to thy clear, calm eyes,\nWas but of transient date.\n'Tis not for such, like us to sit,\nAnd weep, and love, and wait;\n\nWait with a vain and mournful gaze\nFor feet that linger long,\nWait for the voice more dear to us,\nThan aught of mirth and song;\nAnd grieving much, lest over-wronged,\nThe spirit lose its mate;\nAnd sit in deathful solitude,\nAlone, to watch and wait.\n\nNo, Eva, for those eyes, that brow,\nThat proud and manly air,\nHave often mingled with thy dreams,\nAnd with thine earnest prayer!\nAnd how hast thou, all timidly,\nCast down thy maiden eye,\nWhen visions have revealed to thee\nThat figure standing nigh!\n\nTwo spirits launched companionless\nA kindred essence sought,\nAnd one, in all its wanderings,\nOf such as Eva thought.\nThe good, the beautiful, the true,\nShould nestle in his heart,\nShould lure him by her gentle voice,\nTo choose the better part.\n\nAnd he that kindred being sought,\nHad searched with restless care\nFor that true, earnest, woman-soul\nAmong the bright and fair\u2014\nHe might not rest, he felt for him,\nOne such had been created,\nWhose maiden soul in quietude\nFor his all meekly waited.\n\nAnd oft when beaming eyes were nigh,\nAnd beauty's lip was smiling,\nAnd bird-like tones were breathing round\nThe fevered sense beguiling;\nHe felt this was not what he sought\u2014\nThe soul such mockery spurned.\nAnd evermore with aching zeal,\nFor that one being yearned.\n\nAnd she whose loving soul went forth\nWherever beauty dwelt;\nWho with the truthful and the good\nA genial essence felt,\nOh! often in her solitude,\nBy her own soul oppressed,\nShe fain had nestled like a dove\nWithin one stronger breast.\n\nThough higher, holier far than those\nWho listening to her voice,\nA something caught of better things,\nThat make the heart rejoice;\nYet teaching thus her spirit lone\nAweary would have knelt,\nAnd learned with child-like reverence,\nWhere deeper wisdom dwelt.\n\nAnd now that will of stronger growth,\nThat spirit firmer made,\nInstinctive holds her own in check,\nHer timid footsteps stayed;\nAnd Eva in her maidenhood,\nHalf trembles with new fear,\nAnd on her lip that strange, deep smile,\nThe handmaid of a tear.\n\nOh, Eva, child of life and light,\nDid angel missions part,\nWhen half way in its flight to God,\nWas stayed thy maiden heart?\nThine eyes, that unarrested sought\nTheir kindred in the sky,\nNow, with a gentle searchingness,\nRead first brave Albert's eye.\n\nAnd was their glance undimmed from thence?\nWas heaven as near to thee?\nDid folding pinions guard thee still,\nThou child of mystery?\nDid no dim shadows from without\nDarken thine inner light?\nDidst thou in thy white meekness stand,\nAs ever, calm and bright?\n\nOh, human Love! thou seal of life,\nLink to the good and true,\nStrength to the fainting and infirm,\nAnd youth's perpetual dew;\nSo oft art thou allied to tears,\nTo deep and hidden pain,\nThat in our weakness we are prone,\nTo deem thy mission vain:\n\nToo much remembering of thy griefs,\nThy wildness and despair,\nWe seek to God with streaming eyes,\nAnd agony of prayer.\nFar better did we fold our hands,\nThe blessed boon above,\nNor, beeding incidental pangs,\nShield thus the gift of Love.\n\nWhile doubting thus, a seraph stayed\nHis radiant course awhile;\nAnd with a heavenly sympathy,\nLooked on with beaming smile:\nAnd thus his words of spirit-love\nTrust and assurance brought,\nAnd bade her where the soul finds birth,\nTo weakly question not.\n\n'Content to feel\u2014care not to know,\nThe sacred source whence LOVE arise\u2014\nRespect in modesty of soul,\nThis mystery of mysteries:\nMere mind with all its subtle arts,\nHath only learned when thus it gazed\nThe inmost veil of human hearts,\nE'en to themselves must not be raised!'\n\nBut Eva doubted, questioned not,\nContent to only feel,\nThe music of a manly voice,\nUpon her senses steal\u2014\nTo find one heart instinctive learn\nThe beatings of her own,\nAnd read afar unuttered thought\nKnown unto his alone.\n\nAnd firmer grew her heavenward life,\nThus with another blent;\nThey, twin-born souls, the wedded twain,\nOne in God's covenant:\nAnd she in modesty of soul,\nReceived the seal and smiled;\nThe crowning grace of womanhood,\nUpon the sinless child.\n\nHer trusting hand fair Eva laid\nIn that of Albert Linne,\nAnd for one trembling moment turned\nHer gentle thoughts within.\nDeep tenderness was in the glance\nThat rested on his face,\nAs if her woman-heart had found\nIts own abiding place.\n\nAnd evermore to him it seemed\nHer voice more liquid grew,\n'Dear youth, thy soul and mine are one;\nOne source their being drew!\nAnd they must mingle evermore\u2014\nThy thoughts of love and me,\nWill, as a light, thy footsteps guide\nTo life and mystery.'\n\nThere was no sadness in her tone,\nBut Love unfathomed deep;\nAs from the centre of the soul,\nWhere the Divine may sleep:\nProphetic was the tone and look,\nAnd Albert's noble heart,\nSank with a strange foreboding dread,\nLest Eva should depart.\n\nAnd when she bent her timid eyes\nAs she beside him knelt,\nThe pressure of her sinless lips\nUpon his brow he felt,\nAnd all of earth, and all of sin,\nFled from her sainted side;\nShe, the pure virgin of the soul,\nOrdained young Albert's bride.\n\nLow were her sweet and heart-breathed words,\nLow was her voice of prayer,\nBalmy and gentle was her love,\nLike dew in summer air;\nAnd Love, unto the Infinite,\nLike Eva's is allied,\nWe say of such, ''tis gone before,'\nBut not that it hath died."}
