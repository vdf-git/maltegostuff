{"subject": "A Love-Song", "text": "The moon comes forth, bright in the sky;\nA lovelier sight to draw my eye\nIs she, that lady fair.\nShe round my heart has fixed love's chain,\nBut all my longings are in vain.\n'Tis hard the grief to bear.\n\nThe moon comes forth, a splendid sight;\nMore winning far that lady bright,\nObject of my desire!\nDeep-seated is my anxious grief;\nIn vain I seek to find relief;\nWhile glows the secret fire.\n\nThe rising moon shines mild and fair;\nMore bright is she, whose beauty rare\nMy heart with longing fills.\nWith eager wish I pine in vain;\nO for relief from constant pain,\nWhich through my bosom thrills!"}
