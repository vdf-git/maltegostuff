{"subject": "A Memory (From A Sonnet- Sequence)", "text": "Somewhile before the dawn I rose, and stept\n Softly along the dim way to your room,\n And found you sleeping in the quiet gloom,\nAnd holiness about you as you slept.\nI knelt there; till your waking fingers crept\n About my head, and held it.  I had rest\n Unhoped this side of Heaven, beneath your breast.\nI knelt a long time, still; nor even wept.\n\nIt was great wrong you did me; and for gain\nOf that poor moment's kindliness, and ease,\nAnd sleepy mother-comfort!\n                            Child, you know\nHow easily love leaps out to dreams like these,\nWho has seen them true.  And love that's wakened so\nTakes all too long to lay asleep again."}
