{"subject": "A City Rises", "text": "Into the city from the top storey.\nThe streets of Buenos Aires are roaring below.\n\nThe city where everything turns out right.\n\nThey take you along in right-\nangles. But shadows are blowing here \n\nand pebblestone buildings\nswirl. There is one \n\nwith a heart of grazed red stone. \n\nAnd so as not to see a heart pouring itself out\nyou go downstairs. Hang onto your shadow. \n\nThe red hem round your neck opens out\ninto a red river. Think waterfall.\n\nWaterfalls. \n\nA piano lid slams a house shut.\nSwipes a building against the wall. \n\nIn the lift you stumble over the threshold from a certain house.\nA ceiling of stars ascends. \n\nTwenty storeys plunge. Full length. \nA city rises.\n\nTranslation: 2008, Donald Gardner"}
