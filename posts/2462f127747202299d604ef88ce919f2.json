{"subject": "The Sea Is Silent Round This Rocky Shore", "text": "The sea is silent round this rocky shore; \nThe forest wind \nFrom the loud level beach behind \nBrings rolling up the distant water's roar. \n\nSilent the wheeling sea-gull in the air, \nWithout a cry; \nFar off beneath the bending sky \nA silent ship goes down the ocean stair. \n\nThe sea is blue, the sky is white with cloud, \nThe land is white; \nThe seaward rocks are shining bright, \nEnwrapped in a white, salt, and icy shroud. \n\nThe weeds and bushes bare above the snow, \nAgainst the sun \nHold up brave stems, and many a one \nHas February bits of bud to show. \n\nWhere roses grew in one wild garden-close \nI pulled away \nA pair of rose-hips for to-day; \nMemorial to the mistress of the rose."}
