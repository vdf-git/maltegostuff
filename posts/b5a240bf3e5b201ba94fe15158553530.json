{"subject": "Come Sleep, O Sleep! The Certain Knot Of Peace", "text": "Come, Sleep! O Sleep, the certain knot of peace,\nThe baiting-place of wit, the balm of woe,\nThe poor man's wealth, the prisoner's release,\nTh' indifferent judge between the high and low;\nWith shield of proof shield me from out the press\nOf those fierce darts Despair at me doth throw!\nO make in me those civil wars to cease!\u2014 \nI will good tribute pay if thou do so.\nTake thou of me smooth pillows, sweetest bed,\nA chamber deaf of noise and blind of light,\nA rosy garland, and a weary head;\nAnd if these things, as being thine in right,\nMove not thy heavy grace, thou shalt in me,\nLivelier than elsewhere, Stella's image see."}
