{"subject": "The Magnolia", "text": "Song\nWhat, what is the true Southern Symbol,\nThe Symbol of Honor and Right, \nThe Emblem that suits a brave people\nIn arms against number and might?\u2014 \n'Tis the ever green stately Magnolia,\nIts pearl-flowers pure as the Truth, \nDefiant of tempest and lightning,\nIts life a perpetual youth.\n\nFrench blood stained with glory the Lilies,\nWhile centuries marched to their grave; \nAnd over bold Scot and gay Irish\nThe Thistle and Shamrock yet wave: \nOurs, ours be the noble Magnolia,\nThat only on Southern soil grows \nThe Symbol of life everlasting;\u2014\nDear to us as to England the Rose.\n\nPaint the flower on a field blue as Heaven, \nLet the broad leaves around it be seen,\n'SEMPERVIEENS' the eloquent motto, \nOur colors the BLUE, WHITE and GREEN. \nType of Chivalry, loyalty, virtue, \nIn Winter and Summer the same, \nFull of leaf, full of flower, full of vigor- \nIt befits those who fight for a name. \n\nFor a name among Earth's ancient Nations,\nYet more for the Truth and the Right, \nFor Freedom, for proud Independence,\nThe old strife of Darkness and Light. \nRound the World bear the flag of our glory,\nWhile the nations look on and admire, \nAnd our struggle, immortal in story,\nShall the free of all ages inspire.\n\nWhat though many fall in the conflict, \nAnd our blood redden many a field? \nThe foe's on our soil, fellow-soldiers! \nAnd God is our strength and our shield. \nThrough the fire and the smoke bear our banner \nEver on, while a fragment remains! \nWhat though we are few and they many?\nTHE LORD GOD OF ARMIES STILL REIGNS."}
