{"subject": "Auditoriums", "text": "To range in the war was corruption, an error, a snow.\n            A snow over Rome. Near the garage to sew and to\n            sing \u2014 a crystal, inherent, and a wink to the\n            chevalier.\nTo range in the Roman manner was to manage it raw.\nThe seagoer pressed by the woman in arson. The manager,\n            waiting, and in the distance, at least, was wrong.\n            He had played it too near and announced in answers.\n            A changing is shown.\nA personal letter is addressed to the seagoer. Now the\n            rangers warn to swear. A reminder grows. The\n            manner of the answer is warmer.\nThe ram, the swarm and the wren, Ramon and Sergei, all\n            wane.\nIs the seagoer Negro? Arms is the song when the women\n            are meaner. And the mason is worse. As the snow\n             nears, the green grocer is warned. The owner of\n            the organ remains behind. As in Rome, we wear\n            sweaters to visit the gorge.\nBut the woman rose to her wager. Now swear in the arms.\nThe groan means saner, the arrow warm."}
