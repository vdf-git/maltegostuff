{"subject": "Hiroshima", "text": "In the beginning were the elements\nand there was love,\nso they mingled.\nThey became an olive tree\nAnd God called it Hiroshima.\nBeneath it, He rested.\n\nAt winter's end\nGod said to himself:\nSpring has come,\nI shall head to the fields\nfor the hoes are warm\nand desire shudders beneath the soil.\n\nAges passed\nwhile God tilled the earth\nspreading seeds,\ngathering the ripened crops.\nInto the jars\nhe poured wine and oil.\n\nWhen reaping was done\nHe saw that all was good.\nHe said:\nNow is the time for rest.\nI shall go to the olive tree\nfor its shade is dark and vast.\n\nOn the way\nHe smelled smoke.\nHe looked up\nand saw the olive tree burning:\n\nan umbrella\na mushroom sprawling out,\ndust blotting out the faces,\nand on the waters, the winds of Sodom."}
