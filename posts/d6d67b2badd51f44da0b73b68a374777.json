{"subject": "Sonnet Iiii", "text": "NEw yeare forth looking out of Ianus gate,\nDoth seeme to promise hope of new delight:\nand bidding th'old Adieu, his passed date\nbids all old thoughts to die in dumpish spright.\nAnd calling forth out of sad Winters night,\nfresh loue, that long hath slept in cheerlesse bower:\nwils him awake, and soone about him dight\nhis wanton wings and darts of deadly power.\nFor lusty spring now in his timely howre,\nis ready to come forth him to receiue:\nand warnes the Earth with diuers colord flowre,\nto decke hir selfe, and her faire mantle weaue.\nThen you faire flowre, in who fresh youth doth raine,\nprepare your selfe new loue to entertaine."}
