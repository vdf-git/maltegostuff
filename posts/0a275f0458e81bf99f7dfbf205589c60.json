{"subject": "To The Rev. J. W. And His Bride", "text": "An humble poet-save the mark!\nWishes to give to you a lay\nIn honor of your wedding day,\nBut somehow labors in the dark,\nAnd fears from etiquette to stray.\n\nAnd why? No invitation came\nTo bid me tune my simple lyre-\nTo fan my low poetic fire,\nNor yet a hope of deathless fame\nWhich might for risk, serve me for hire.\n\nI'll run the risk and fearless strike\nA lyre too apt to slumber long,\nAnd pour my thoughts in artless song.\nMany there are who do the like,\nAnd yet in this may do no wrong.\n\nNow, I would hope sweet blessings may\nFlow to you from our Father kind:\nThe rich gift of a happy mind,\nIn Wisdom's paths content to stay,\nAnd purest peace in that to find.\n\nI trust you will be filled with love,\nSuch love as God alone can give;\nThat you may still before Him live.\nPlacing your hopes always above,\nMay you his Spirit never grieve.\n\nO, may you still, as man and wife,\nMutual confidence possess;\nFor this will free from much distress\nYour family in after life,\nAnd make your care and sorrow less.\n\nMay both such lovely patterns be\nOf what your character requires,\nThat if brought through Affliction's fires\nMankind your purity may see;\nAnd which to see God most desires.\n\nAnd may you ever useful prove\nIn making known Christ's saving Name;\nYour minds not swayed by worldly fame-\nIn urging souls to taste that Love\nWhich cheers our hearts through scorn and shame.\n\nAnd should you by His Grace become\nA numerous, holy, happy band,\nStill he'll uphold you by His Hand,\nTill all at last come safely home\nUnto that glorious Spirit Land."}
