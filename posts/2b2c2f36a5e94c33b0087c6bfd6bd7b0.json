{"subject": "Envoi", "text": "Go, dumb-born book,\nTell her that sang me once that song of Lawes:\nHadst thou but song\nAs thou hast subjects known,\nThen were there cause in thee that should condone\nEven my faults that heavy upon me lie\nAnd build her glories their longevity.\nTell her that sheds\nSuch treasure in the air,\nRecking naught else but that her graces give\nLife to the moment,\nI would bid them live\nAs roses might, in magic amber laid,\nRed overwrought with orange and all made\nOne substance and one colour\nBraving time.\nTell her that goes\nWith song upon her lips\nBut sings not out the song, nor knows\nThe maker of it, some other mouth,\nMay be as fair as hers,\nMight, in new ages, gain her worshippers,\nWhen our two dusts with Waller's shall be laid,\nSiftings on siftings in oblivion,\nTill change hath broken down\nAll things save Beauty alone."}
