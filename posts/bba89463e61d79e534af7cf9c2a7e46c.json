{"subject": "At Twilight", "text": "You are a painter\u2014listen\u2014\nI'll paint you a picture too! \nOf the long white lights that glisten \nThrough Michigan Avenue; \nWith the red lights down the middle \nWhere the street shines mirror-wet, \nWhile the rain-strung sky is a fiddle \nFor the wind to feel and fret. \nLook! far in the east great spaces\nMeet out on the level lake, \nWhere the lit ships veil their faces\nAnd glide like ghosts at a wake; \nAnd up in the air, high over\nThe rain-shot shimmer of light, \nThe huge sky-scrapers hover\nAnd shake out their stars at the night. \nOh, the city trails gold tassels\nFrom the skirts of her purple gown, \nAnd lifts up her commerce castles\nLike a jewel-studded crown. \nSee, proudly she moves on, singing \nUp the storm-dimmed track of time\u2014 \nRoad dark and dire, \nWhere each little light \nIs a soul afire \nAgainst the night! \nOh, grandly she marches, flinging \nHer gifts at our feet, and singing!\u2014\n\nHave I chalked out a sketch in my rhyme ?"}
