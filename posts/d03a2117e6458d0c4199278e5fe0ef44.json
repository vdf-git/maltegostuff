{"subject": "The Owls", "text": "Among the black yews, their shelter,\nthe owls are ranged in a row,\nlike alien deities, the glow,\nof their red eyes pierces. They ponder.\nThey perch there without moving,\ntill that melancholy moment\nwhen quenching the falling sun,\nthe shadows are growing.\nTheir stance teaches the wise\nto fear, in this world of ours,\nall tumult, and all movement:\nMankind drunk on brief shadows\nalways incurs a punishment\nfor his longing to stir, and go."}
