{"subject": "The Veteran", "text": "UNDERNEATH the autumn sky,\nHaltingly, the lines go by.\nAh, would steps were blithe and gay,\nAs when first they marched away,\nSmile on lip and curl on brow,\nOnly white-faced gray-beards now,\nStanding on life's outer verge,\nE'en the marches sound a dirge.\nBlow, you bugles, play, you fife,\nRattle, drums, for dearest life.\nLet the flags wave freely so,\nAs the marching legions go,\nShout, hurrah and laugh and jest,\nThis is memory at its best.\n(Did you notice at your quip,\nThat old comrade's quivering lip?)\nAh, I see them as they come,\nStumbling with the rumbling drum;\nBut a sight more sad to me\nE'en than these ranks could be\nWas that one with cane upraised\nWho stood by and gazed and gazed,\nTrembling, solemn, lips compressed,\nLonging to be with the rest.\nDid he dream of old alarms,\nAs he stood, 'presented arms '?\nDid he think of field and camp\nAnd the unremitting tramp\nMile on mile \u2014 the lonely guard\nWhen he kept his midnight ward?\nDid he dream of wounds and scars\nIn that bitter war of wars?\nWhat of that? He stood and stands\nIn my memory \u2014 trembling hands,\nWhitened beard and cane and all\nAs if waiting for the call \nOnce again: 'To arms, my sons,'\nAnd his ears hear far-off guns,\nRoll of cannon and the tread\nOf the legions of the Dead!"}
