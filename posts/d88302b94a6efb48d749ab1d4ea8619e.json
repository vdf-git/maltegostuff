{"subject": "Just A Dream", "text": "When I am asleep I always dream\nNot knowing what will happen tonight\nThat the worst part\nNot knowing\nGood or bad\nFun or misery\nMoney or homework\nHappiness or depression\nNobody knows\nNot even the dreamer\nSo those who do dream\nHave an uncontrollable gift\nTo dream\nAlas you have to wake up but then\nIt is just a dream"}
