{"subject": "Jane", "text": "My daughter Jane makes dresses\nFor beautiful Princesses;\nBut though she's plain is Jane,\nOf needlework she's vain,\nAnd makes such pretty things\nFor relatives of Kings.\n\nShe reads the picture papers\nWhere Royalties cut capers,\nAnd often says to me:\n'How wealthy they must be,\nThat nearly every day\nA new robe they can pay.'\n\nSays I: 'If your Princesses\nCould fabric pretty dresses,\nThough from a throne they stem\nI would think more of them.\nPeeress and shopgirl are\nTo my mind on a par.'\n\nSays Jane: 'But for their backing\nI might be sewing sacking.\nInstead, I work with joy\nIn exquisite employ,\nEmbroidering rich dresses\nFor elegant Princesses . . .\nDamn social upsetters\nWho criticise their betters!'"}
