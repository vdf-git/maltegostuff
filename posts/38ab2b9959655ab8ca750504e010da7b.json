{"subject": "Slain", "text": "Let her lie upon your heart while she faints,\nWhere she slept such a short time ago;\nO! she's young to be crowned with the saints\u2014\nHold her fast, mother, do not let her go!\nThe roses are not dead on her cheeks,\nThere is but a passing chill in their bloom;\nIt will melt when she smiles, when she speaks\u2014\nHush! was not that her voice in the room?\nShe is looking like a babe as she lies\nWith her ringlets swept aside and apart\u2014\nAh, mother, keep the tears in your eyes,\nIf they fall upon her face she may start.\nDid some one break her heart with a word,\nHaving grasped it at first as a prize?\nDid it flutter from his hand, like a bird\nWhich goes a little way, and then dies?\nHe remembers the joy of her face,\nThe love in her smile, and the light,\nWhen, shrinking, she met his embrace\u2014\nBring him here, let him look at her to-night!\nO! first came the wonder and the doubt,\nAnd the pale hope fading day by day,\nSo wistfully she wandered about,\nLike a lost child asking its way;\nAnd then came the silence and despair,\nAnd the sighing after wings like a dove,\nAnd the proud heart bleeding into prayer,\nBut hiding all its wounds from your love.\nIt is over and the tale is all told,\nAnd the white lamb lies dead in the frost;\nYou may cover up its limbs from the cold,\nBut you cannot find a life that is lost.\nWe were thinking that she moved, but her cheek\nWas but stirred by the breast where she lay\nHeaving a moment, while we speak,\nWith the quiet sobs forcing their way.\nLet them come, poor mother, let them come;\nYou must turn when your tears are all done\nTo a blank in the sweet talk at home,\nAnd a name on a little grey stone."}
