{"subject": "Beat Of My Heart", "text": "The way heart beats, will I survive longer?\r\nFeelings that I hope to soon forget\r\nRevisions or not, will I continue forward?\r\nSenses of relief breaking away from under\r\nUnder the skin arises once sought out\r\nMeanings are only attached to be assumed \r\nThe liveliness of our two worlds colliding\r\nFlames inside me spark to ignite a fire\r\nWill I burn, if so, please as the sun?\r\nDisingenuous to not be, do I really feel this?\r\nWondering of the heart, am I alone?\r\nOr the need to not be creates distortions\r\nThe world is tempting and I will not be victim\r\nMy innards desire this but do I complete?\r\nUnknown until sun is down, stars are visible \r\nPondering thoughts make me courageous yet unsettled \r\nNot your burden to facilitate but the opportunity \r\nLike a light, I may be on or I may be off\r\nWishing these would leave but I am plagued \r\nThe institutions created this level field \r\nTell me where do I continue on this path?\r\nAs again, why does my heart beat at all\r\nWhere my heart starts to beat for you again \r\nWords are meaningless without attachment \r\nI lay between a war of heart and soul\r\nAm I meaningless without attachment?"}
