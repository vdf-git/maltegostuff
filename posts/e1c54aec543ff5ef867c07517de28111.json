{"subject": "The Sense Of Love", "text": "A leaf alone, in Autumn moon and night, \nIn Winter turns to lantern, golden light; \nA group of gulls in gossip, fog and ear, \nCan rob the mind of solitude and fear; \nAn ocean breeze can often be retraced \nA mile away on lips and tongue and taste; \nA crowded street, a meadow, forest, swells \nThe nose the way a pillow does and tells; \nA hand, a breath, a patch of sun, is such \nEnchantment in the skin and mind and touch; \nAnd all along the way the senses serve \nAs pathways to another through the nerve; \nAnd all of this to reach across the shore \nAnd in love find and bind the heart and core."}
