{"subject": "Preferment", "text": "Attack the Sovereign's ear;\nDelight her;\nReward shall be, ne'er fear,\nA mitre. \n\nThe man who will a race begin\nMust persevere, or he'll not win;\nOr, at the door, must fast and quake,\nExcept he makes the knocker speak.\nWhat miner ever finds a vein,\nExcept he tries and tries again?\nIf you'd let fortune through the door,\nYou must invite her o'er and o'er.\n\nHowever, I'll no longer comment,\nBut give the subject up this moment.\nLet Maddox, who was oft translated,\nAdvance, and prove the point debated.\nIsaac, in training, it was said,\nLike me, on scanty commons fed;\nOr, with more truth, may be observ'd,\nLike me, on barren commons starv'd.\n\nHis aunt was poor, his parents gone;\nTh' unhappy lot of many a one;\nWas plac'd, when he his play forsook,\nApprentice to a pastry-cook.\n\nWhat tastes he pleas'd is quite unknown;\nBut, it was thought, he pleas'd his own.\nFor where's the man, among a host,\nWho will not think of self the most?\n\nHe, notic'd by a stander-by,\n'Could read a book, or make a pye.'\nThis friend perceiv'd the lad had spirit;\nLent authors to improve his merit.\n\nAt Glasgow's sacred school, we find\nThe youth, who'd left the tart behind.\nThe Presbyterian fund, he'd try,\nAnd fill a pulpit by and by.\nThe food he made was chang'd--the whole\nThen for the body--now the soul.\n\nHis patron died; much us'd to bless,\nAnd left the pulpit in distress.\nThen poverty, with awful pace,\nAdvanc'd, and star'd him in the face.\nHis aunt must give him, in retreat,\nThat bread which she herself could eat.\n\nTime, in the shape of months, pass'd by,\nBut nought occurr'd to chear the eye--\n'Dissenting int'rest dormant lies--\nThe Church! Ay, that's the place to rise!\nA Mr. Roper has some weight\nWith the First Minister of State;\nRequest him, aunt, if you think meet,\nTo lay me at Sir Robert's feet.'\n\nRoper attends the hungry bevy\nOf leeches at Sir Robert's levee.\n'Sir, there's a youth can well support\nThe Whiggish int'rest of the Court--\nHe'll prove most faithful; has a spirit;\nThen let a smile reward his merit.\nTo serve the Church his talent lies;\nNor shews a backwardness to rise.'\n\n'The Court Retainers, Sir, abound;\nPlaces for not one-third are found.\nThe vermin hatch, and become pests,\nSooner than we can find them nests.\nThen let solicitations end--\nNo nest is vacant for your friend.'\n\nWith solemn voice, with lengthen'd visage,\nThe aunt reported Roper's presage.\nIsaac receiv'd this sore denial\nNot like a man when brought to trial.\n\n'O, never mind--the case will do,\nIf Walpole has been spoken to.\nLike a philosopher, 'tis clear,\nIt rests with me to persevere;\nMust stedfast hold, be silent still,\nThough bullied, kick'd, and cuff'd at will.'\n\nIsaac, next day, assum'd his best;\nBrush'd well his hat, his shoes, his vest;\nPowder'd his wig; the whole to crown,\nPut on his gloves, his band, and gown;\nThen issued forth in this gay mood--\nT' invite Dame Fortune, if he cou'd;\n\n'And 'tis a guinea to.an ace\nSir Robert's levee is the place.'\n\nHere Isaac constantly attends;\nThe only man unpropp'd by friends.\nEach levee, for three months the same,\nHe silent went, and silent came.\n\nThe Bishop of old Chichester\nAddress'd the British Minister--\n'Pray, what young Clergyman stands there?\nI never come but see him here.'\n\n'Pray, Sir, inform me whence you came?\nWhat is your business, and your name?'\n'My name is Maddox, Sir,'--and bow'd.\nAll eyes upon him from the crowd.\n'I'm he whom Roper had in view,\nWho lately waited upon you.'\n\n'I think you've great assurance, Sir,\nTo follow me with your demur;\nAfter what I to Roper said,\nYou never ought to shew your head.'\n\nConfusion seiz'd the trembling Priest;\nThe subject of a courtly jest.\nHe sunk, he blush'd, he eyed the ground--\nThe ruler of thee kingdoms frown'd!\n\nIf Walpole's heart obdurate felt,\nThe Bishop's heart began to melt.\nModest distress he's hurt to see,\nThen whisper'd--' Sir, come dine with me.'\n\nWhether they try to cultivate\nPoints of Religion or of State;\nRehearse the virtues, while they dine,\nOf Royal George or Caroline;\nOr whether they, in their debate,\nChange most their subject, or their plate;\nBest in heroics will appear--\nHow can I tell? I was not there.\nBut Maddox from restraint was eas'd;\nThey din'd, they drank, and both were pleas'd.\n\nThe Bishop, with a look benign,\nTook by the hand the young divine--\n'From this day, while I hold the see,\nYou shall, dear Sir, my Chaplain be.'\n\nHe now could say--in a defeat,\nOut of a bitter comes a sweet.\nSir Robert's heart of flinty stone\nStruck up a light which burnt and shone.\nThe Bishop's heart of soft desire,\nLike tinder, caught a milder fire.\n\nThis inference will follow clear;\nHe that would rise must persevere.\n\nTHE SECOND PART\n\nThe Hunter, with a Fox in view,\nHolds the best motive to pursue.\n\nFix'd to content, he cast about\nTo find Court Places which fell out.\nFor deaths, removes, near Queens and Kings,\nTo rising pride, and charming things;\nHis watchful eye, to place inclin'd,\nNumber'd the beating pulse behind;\nAnd, though some distance from the call,\nKnew, to an hour, when placemen fall.\n\nOur persevering Isaac said,\n'A Clerk of the Queen's closet's dead--\nOne word, my Lord, to Caroline,\nFrom you, would make the closet mine.'\n\nThe worthy Prelate smil'd assent,\nBut ere he on this errand went,\nGreat London's Bishop, in a trice,\nEnter'd the palace for advice--\n'A place is fallen--have you a friend,\nMy Lord, that I can recommend?\nFor none in my large train are seen,\nI apprehend, will suit the Queen.'\n\n'Yes, I've a youth, the most acute,\nWho will the Queen exactly suit--\nMy Chaplain. He the knack has got\nTo please my wife's ear to a jot;\nAnd all this with surprizing ease;\nThen surely he the Queen's can please.'\n\nNow Isaac, at St. James's seen,\nBecame a favourite of the Queen;\nA favour, half the world could tell,\nWould add a lustre where it fell.\n\nOur Royal Chaplain, by some means,\nProcur'd a list of English Deans;\n'Noted their age, their income, wealth,\nWho had, but most who wanted, health.\nBut few were from diseases free;\nFor all were nurs'd on Lux'ry's knee.'\nAffliction rais'd his spirits high;\nThe term of life could prophesy.\n'The Dean of Bath and Wells seem'd worst--\nHe hop'd the Lord would call him first.'\nProcur'd a spy to wing news fast\nThe moment he should breathe his last.\n\nShort time elaps'd; death seiz'd the Dean;\nIsaac, as quick, flew to the Queen.\nBut here we must the maxim wave--\n'Good fortune will attend the brave.'\nThe Queen in contemplation gone\nIn Privy Garden, and alone,\nWhere all intrusion was forbidden,\nWhere every action must be hidden,\nBut Isaac could not stay awhile;\nOpen'd the door in suppliant stile;\nTold her the case--he wish'd the thing--\n'Begg'd she would move it to the King.'\n\n'Me don't know dat I sal,' she said,\nIn angry mood--then turn'd her head.\n\nIsaac, with humble powers, was seen\nEmploy'd to pacify the Queen.\n'The pressing case was his excuse;\nHe hop'd the Queen would not refuse.\nHer pardon begg'd agen, agen.'\n'Vell, me vill tink upon it den.'\n\nAnother Prelate now appears\nWho'd serv'd the Church near thirty years.\nHe bent his back and upper end,\n'To beg the Deanry for a friend.'\n''Tis gone an hour, vor Maddox spake;\nGood Lord, my verd me cannot break.'\n'He deals with Belzebub, I'm clear on't--\nI wonder how he came to hear on't!'\n\nHis copious list of Deans and ills\nMay light his pipe, or hold his pills,\nBe useful in a humbler case,\nBut to another must give place;\nTo that of Bishops much diminish'd;\nTwo dozen names, and then 'tis finish'd.\n\nHis Mercury had soon to tell\nThe Bishop of St. Asaph fell.\nThe ear of Caroline must know--\nAn ear he guided long ago,\n'Wish'd in a mitre he might sleep,\nThe Deanry in commendam keep.'\n\nGeorge would but half his wish fulfil;\nOnly replied--'take which you will.'\nThe Bishop-hunter lov'd the scent;\nWas now a Lord of Parliament;\nHis catalogue told with great ease,\nWhether to Heaven or other Sees\nThey were translated; in his case\nHe only wish'd to take their place.\n\nThe learned Hough of Wor'ster fell;\nHis mitre fitted Isaac well.\nThus circumstanc'd, could he lament\nThat death's a sorrowful event?\nNeither in this can we agree--\nPhysicians only gain a fee.\n\nHis ghostly list was not to seek\n'Twas regulated once a week.\nIntelligence could never lack;\nHis was a true Church Almanack;\nCould better tell when Bishops die,\nThan any star that decks the sky.\nBut in this point we must agree--\nDeath kept a list as well as he;\nAnd stopp'd him short; or, left alone,\nHe'd found a way to Becket's throne."}
