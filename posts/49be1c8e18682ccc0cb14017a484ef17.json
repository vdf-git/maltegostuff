{"subject": "Always Darker", "text": "The wind, which moves purple treetops,\n\nIs God's breath that comes and goes.\n\nThe black village rises before the forest;\n\nThree shadows are laid over the field.\n\nMeagerly the valley dusks\n\nBelow and silent for the humble.\n\nA seriousness greets in garden and hall,\n\nThat wants to finish the day,\n\nPiously and darkly an organ-sound.\n\nMarie is enthroned there in blue vestment\n\nAnd cradles her babe in hand.\n\nThe night is starlit and long."}
