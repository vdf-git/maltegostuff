{"subject": "The Mediterranean", "text": "Where we went in the boat was a long bay\na slingshot wide, walled in by towering stone--\nPeaked margin of antiquity's delay,\nAnd we went there out of time's monotone:\n\nWhere we went in the black hull no light moved\nBut a gull white-winged along the feckless wave,\nThe breeze, unseen but fierce as a body loved,\nThat boat drove onward like a willing slave:\n\nWhere we went in the small ship the seaweed\nParted and gave to us the murmuring shore\nAnd we made feast and in our secret need\nDevoured the very plates Aeneas bore:\n\nWhere derelict you see through the low twilight\nThe green coast that you, thunder-tossed, would win,\nDrop sail, and hastening to drink all night\nEat dish and bowl--to take that sweet land in!\n\nWhere we feasted and caroused on the sandless\nPebbles, affecting our day of piracy,\nWhat prophecy of eaten plates could landless\nWanderers fulfil by the ancient sea?\n\nWe for that time might taste the famous age\nEternal here yet hidden from our eyes\nWhen lust of power undid its stuffless rage;\nThey, in a wineskin, bore earth's paradise.\n\nLet us lie down once more by the breathing side\nOf Ocean, where our live forefathers sleep\nAs if the Known Sea still were a month wide--\nAtlantis howls but is no longer steep!\n\nWhat country shall we conquer, what fair land\nUnman our conquest and locate our blood?\nWe've cracked the hemispheres with careless hand!\nNow, from the Gates of Hercules we flood\n\nWestward, westward till the barbarous brine\nWhelms us to the tired land where tasseling corn,\nFat beans, grapes sweeter than muscadine\nRot on the vine: in that land were we born."}
