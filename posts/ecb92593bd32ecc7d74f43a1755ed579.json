{"subject": "To the Honourable Elizabeth Sedley, Learning to Spin", "text": "To the Honourable Elizabeth Sedley, Learning to Spin, She and the Author equally having an aversion to a Spider.\n\nWou'd you, though true what Sterne enforces,\nThat we must have our hobby horses,\nYou, of all people, mount the hackney,\n(Dear Madam pause!) that threw Arachne?\nO for your comfort \u2014 and for mine \u2014\nHold! Stop! forbear the rash design!\nThe Goddess of the loom and wheel\nThis similar affront will feel:\nTo rival her in every virtue\nGo on, and Pallas will not hurt you:\nBut wisdom has its foibles, leave her\nSpinster pre-eminent and weaver,\nOr she will take revenge most frightful.\nCan heavenly bosoms be so spiteful?\nYes; lay aside that Lydian's pride, or \nYou will be chang'd to, oh! a spider.\n\nWou'd you what most you hate resemble? \u2014\nWith dire forebodings how I tremble! \u2014\nYour upright shape you lose, methinks,\nTo a foul lump your body shrinks;\nI see, and at the sight am troubled,\nYour arms and legs in number doubled;\nFear-struck, I stare upon the wall,\nBelshazzar-like, as there you crawl.\n\nMust one, 'till now so fair, alas!\nRun screaming from her looking-glass?\nShall Rachael rush into the room\nTo attack her mistress with the broom?\nMust you in chest or chimney hide you?\nAnd must I own I can't abide you?\nAh, though the brightest nymph, 'tis true,\nCan never draw my eyes from you;\nAnd though for you I shall be looking\nEach passage dark and private nook in;\nThough language can't express my feeling,\nWhile you're descending from the ceiling;\nThough I shall stand prepar'd to seize you,\nFull of impatience close to squeeze you,\nLet not your honour take alarms: \u2014\nI stretch the tongs and not my arms."}
