{"subject": "Brown's Tram", "text": "A city clerk was Henry Brown,\nWhose suburb knew nor tram nor train;\nAnd ev'ry morn he walked to town.\n\nFrom nine till five, with busy brain,\nHe labored in an office dim.\nEach eve he walked out home again.\n\nAnd all this tramping seemed to him\nA waste of time, for, 'mid the strife,\nHe could not keep his lawn in trim.\n\nIt clouded his domestic life -\nThis going early, coming late -\nAnd much distressed his little wife.\n\nThen some wise man declared the State\nShould put in trams, and for this scheme\nBrown was a red-hot advocate.\n\nAt last he realised his dream;\nAnd daily in and out of town\nHe trammed it with content supreme.\n\nFor, though it cost him half-a-crown\nA week in fares, the time he saved\nMeant much to him and Mrs. Brown.\n\nAnd so they lived and pinched and slaved\nAnd their suburban happiness\nSeemed all that they had ever craved.\n\nThe little wife began to bless\nThe trams; nor grieved their meagre dole\nWas weekly two and sixpence less.\n\nThen Brown's employer, kindly soul,\nLearned of this tram-car luxury,\nAnd promptly rose to take his toll.\n\nHe sent for Brown and said that he\nShould now contrive to come at eight\nSince trams blessed his vicinity.\n\nHe also deemed it wise to state\nThat idleness begat much ill,\nAnd it was wrong to sleep in late.\n\nYet Brown contrived to tram it still,\nAnd trim his lawn with tender care,\nAnd pay his rent and baker's bill.\n\nHis little wife vowed it unfair;\nBut bowed to stern, relentless fate,\nAnd smiled and sewed and worked her share.\n\nJust here, the landlord wrote to state,\nSince trams improved his property,\nHe'd raise the rent as from that date.\n\n'Three shillings weekly will not be\nToo much - an equitable rise,\nConsidering the trams,' wrote he.\n\nWhat profit oaths or women's sighs?\nHis 'sacred rights,' of wealth the fount,\nA landlord has to recognise.\n\nTo what do poor clerks' lives amount?\nAn extra hour of slavery\nSwells an employer's bank account.\n\nThe wealthy boss thanks God that he\nHas saved some money out of Brown.\nThe landlord smiles contentedly.\n\nThe trams run gaily up and down,\nA sight Brown sadly notes as he\nPlods daily in and out of town."}
