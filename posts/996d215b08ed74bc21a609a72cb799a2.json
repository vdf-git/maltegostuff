{"subject": "Water Lilies", "text": "If you have forgotten water lilies floating \nOn a dark lake among mountains in the afternoon shade, \nIf you have forgotten their wet, sleepy fragrance, \nThen you can return and not be afraid. \n\nBut if you remember, then turn away forever \nTo the plains and the prairies where pools are far apart, \nThere you will not come at dusk on closing water lilies, \nAnd the shadow of mountains will not fall on your heart."}
