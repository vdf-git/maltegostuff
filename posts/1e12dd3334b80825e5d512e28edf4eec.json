{"subject": "The Glance Returned", "text": "When you are seven years old,\nlying in the back of a station wagon\nwhile your parents play night tennis;\nwhen the knowledge that you are going\nto die one day comes through\nthe rallies, players' voices,\nand songs from a dashboard radio\nleft on like an audible night light;\nyou listen hard to the faultless\nworkings of your life: your heartbeat\nmuffled under a blanket; your breath,\npainting cone-shaped plumes on the glass;\nYou trade sleep for the ache\nof a nameless concept, and feel\nthe margins of your days begin to close.\nYou are not prepared for this.\nYou leave the car and look beyond\nthe capped, swinging court lights,\nblurred by an attendant rain of moths\nand flying ants, and you search\nthe sky for meaning. Linking stars\nand smears of low, transparent cloud,\nyou find a wound in the side\nof an overripe fig; a lizard,\nits position on a stone betrayed\nonly when it blinks. But then\na tennis ball clears the fence,\na player laughs, and your parents return\nsmelling of sweat and cigarettes.\nWhen they ask why you're up so late;\nwhat you're doing outside the car;\nyou've not the words for what you know.\nOn the way home, you lie down\nand stare at the backs of their heads,\nwhich are dark, then silver\nin the lights of an overtaking lorry.\nYour father turns the radio off.\nYour mother turns to look at him.\nThey do not speak. You touch yourself\nunder the blanket, carefully,\nand forget about death for awhile.\nWhen the backs of their heads\nflare again, you promise yourself\nyou'll remember that moment;\nand you do, thirty-two years later,\nsitting up in bed, when your wife's face\nis lit by a car pulling into the drive.\nIn the dark again, you sense her\nglance at you. The glance returned,\nyou ask if she remembers\nhow old she was, or what she was doing\nwhen her first thoughts of death arrived. \nWhen she doesn't answer, you say\nStar, fig, lizard, and wait for the lights\nof another car to print\nthe shadows of your heads on the wall."}
