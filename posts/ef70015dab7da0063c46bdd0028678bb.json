{"subject": "I Have A Hundred Lives", "text": "I have a hundred lives before me yet\nTo grasp thee in, O Spirit ethereal,\nBe sure I will with heart insatiate\nPursue thee like a hunter through them all.\n\nThou yet shalt turn back on the eternal way\nAnd with awakened vision watch me come\nSmiling a little at errors past and lay \nThy eager hand in mine, its proper home.\n\nMeanwhile made happy by thy happiness\nI shall approach thee in things and people dear, \nAnd in thy spirit's motions half-possess,\nLoving what thou hast loved, shall feel thee near,\n\nUntil I lay my hands on thee indeed\nSomewhere among the stars, as 'twas decreed."}
