{"subject": "The Song Of Exile", "text": "My homeland has many palm-trees\nand the thrush-song fills its air; \nno bird here can sing as well\nas the birds sing over there.\n\nWe have fields more full of flowers\nand a starrier sky above,\nwe have woods more full of life\nand a life more full of love.\n\nLonely night-time meditations\nplease me more when I am there; \nmy homeland has many palm-trees\nand the thrush-song fills its air.\n\nSuch delights as my land offers\nAre not found here nor elsewhere; \nlonely night-time meditations\nplease me more when I am there; \nMy homeland has many palm-trees\nand the thrush-song fills its air.\n\nDon't allow me, God, to die\nwithout getting back to where\nI belong, without enjoying\nthe delights found only there,\nwithout seeing all those palm-trees,\nhearing thrush-songs fill the air."}
