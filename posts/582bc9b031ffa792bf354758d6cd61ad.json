{"subject": "Birthday", "text": "(16th January 1949)\n\nI thank whatever gods may be\nFor all the happiness that's mine;\nThat I am festive, fit and free\nTo savour women, wit and wine;\nThat I may game of golf enjoy,\nAnd have a formidable drive:\nIn short, that I'm a gay old boy\nThough I be\n                    Seventy-and-five.\n\nMy daughter thinks. because I'm old\n(I'm not a crock, when all is said),\nI mustn't let my feet get cold,\nAnd should wear woollen socks in bed;\nA worsted night-cap too, forsooth!\nTo humour her I won't contrive:\nA man is in his second youth\nWhen he is\n                    Seventy-and-five.\n\nAt four-score years old age begins,\nAnd not till then, I warn my wife;\nAt eighty I'll recant my sins,\nAnd live a staid and sober life.\nBut meantime let me whoop it up,\nAnd tell the world that I'm alive:\nFill to the brim the bubbly cup -\nHere's health to\n                    Seventy-and-five!"}
