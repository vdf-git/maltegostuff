{"subject": "Elephants Are Different To Different People", "text": "Wilson and Pilcer and Snack stood before the zoo elephant.\n\n    Wilson said, 'What is its name? Is it from Asia or Africa? Who feeds\nit? Is it a he or a she? How old is it? Do they have twins? How much does\nit cost to feed? How much does it weigh? If it dies, how much will another\none cost? If it dies, what will they use the bones, the fat, and the hide\nfor? What use is it besides to look at?'\n\n    Pilcer didn't have any questions; he was murmering to himself, 'It's\na house by itself, walls and windows, the ears came from tall cornfields,\nby God; the architect of those legs was a workman, by God; he stands like\na bridge out across the deep water; the face is sad and the eyes are kind;\nI know elephants are good to babies.'\n\n    Snack looked up and down and at last said to himself, 'He's a tough\nson-of-a-gun outside and I'll bet he's got a strong heart, I'll bet he's\nstrong as a copper-riveted boiler inside.'\n\n    They didn't put up any arguments.\n    They didn't throw anything in each other's faces.\n    Three men saw the elephant three ways\n    And let it go at that.\n    They didn't spoil a sunny Sunday afternoon;\n\n'Sunday comes only once a week,' they told each other."}
