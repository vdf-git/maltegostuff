{"subject": "Learning To Pray", "text": "My inmost soul, O Lord, to thee\nLeans like a growing flower\nUnto the light. I do not know\nThe day nor blessed hour\nWhen that deep-rooted, daring growth\nWe call the heart's desire\nShall burst and blossom to a prayer\nWithin the sacred fire\nOf thy great patience; grow so pure,\nSo still, so sweet a thing\nAs perfect prayer must surely be.\nAnd yet my heart will sing\nBecause thou seem'st sometimes so near.\nClose-present God! to me,\nIt seems I could not have a wish\nThat was not shared by thee;\nIt seems I cannot be afraid\nTo speak my longings out,\nSo tenderly thy gathering love\nEnfolds me round about;\nIt seems as if my heart would break,\nIf, living on the light\nI should not lift to thee at last\nA bud of flawless white.\nAnd yet, O helpless heart! how sweet\nTo grow, and bud, and say:\nThe flower, however marred or wan,\nShall not be cast away."}
