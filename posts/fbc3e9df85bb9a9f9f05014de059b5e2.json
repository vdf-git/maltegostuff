{"subject": "A Song Of Three Singers", "text": "I\n\nWave and wind and willow-tree\nSpeak a speech that no man knoweth;\nTree that sigheth, wind that bloweth,\nWave that floweth to the sea:\nWave and wind and willow-tree.\n\nPeerless perfect poets ye,\nSinging songs all songs excelling,\nFine as crystal music dwelling\nIn a welling fountain free:\nPeerless perfect poets three!\n\nII\n\nWave and wind and willow-tree\nKnow not aught of poets' rhyming,\nYet they make a silver-chiming\nSunward-climbing minstrelsy,\nSoother than all songs that be.\n\nBlows the wind it knows not why,\nFlows the wave it knows not whither,\nAnd the willow swayeth hither\nSwayeth thither witlessly,\nNothing knowing save to sigh."}
