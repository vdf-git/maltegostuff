{"subject": "Riding Free", "text": "Riding the thermals \nFrom coast to coast, \nRides like the wind. \nThrough colored trails of motion, \nLike continuous exposure of film, \nLike day dreams, \nAnd the secrets of wonder, \nOr a bird in flight, \nFlying free into the night. \nWith imagination my power, \nWill enlarge and grow, \nInspired by the freedom, and \nCaptivated by earth's beauty, \nMy passion for life knows, \nThe transformation of my mind, \nRenewing, growing, throbbing ideas, \nLiving life, creating wisdom, \nTrue happiness and freedom, \nAs the spirit creates, \nThe hour for which I was born, \nProphetic to the end."}
