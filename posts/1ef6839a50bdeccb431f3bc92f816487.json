{"subject": "Mariposa", "text": "Butterflies are white and blue\nIn this field we wander through.\nSuffer me to take your hand.\nDeath comes in a day or two.\n\nAll the things we ever knew\nWill be ashes in that hour,\nMark the transient butterfly,\nHow he hangs upon the flower.\n\nSuffer me to take your hand.\nSuffer me to cherish you\nTill the dawn is in the sky.\nWhether I be false or true,\nDeath comes in a day or two."}
