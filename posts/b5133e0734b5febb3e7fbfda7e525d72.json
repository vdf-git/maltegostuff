{"subject": "A Thanksgiving To God, For His House", "text": "Lord, thou hast given me a cell,\nWherein to dwell;\nA little house, whose humble roof\nIs weather proof;\nUnder the spars of which I lie\nBoth soft and dry;\nWhere thou, my chamber for to ward,\nHast set a guard\nOf harmless thoughts, to watch and keep\nMe, while I sleep.\nLow is my porch, as is my fate;\nBoth void of state;\nAnd yet the threshold of my door\nIs worn by th' poor,\nWho thither come, and freely get\nGood words, or meat.\nLike as my parlour, so my hall\nAnd kitchen's small;\nA little buttery, and therein\nA little bin,\nWhich keeps my little loaf of bread\nUnchipt, unflead;\nSome brittle sticks of thorn or briar\nMake me a fire,\nClose by whose living coal I sit,\nAnd glow like it.\nLord, I confess too, when I dine,\nThe pulse is thine,\nAnd all those other bits that be\nThere placed by thee;\nThe worts, the purslain, and the mess\nOf water-cress,\nWhich of thy kindness thou hast sent;\nAnd my content\nMakes those, and my beloved beet,\nTo be more sweet.\n'Tis thou that crown'st my glittering hearth\nWith guiltless mirth,\nAnd giv'st me wassail bowls to drink,\nSpiced to the brink.\nLord, 'tis thy plenty-dropping hand\nThat soils my land,\nAnd giv'st me, for my bushel sown,\nTwice ten for one;\nThou mak'st my teeming hen to lay\nHer egg each day;\nBesides, my healthful ewes to bear\nMe twins each year;\nThe while the conduits of my kine\nRun cream, for wine:\nAll these, and better, thou dost send\nMe, to this end,--\nThat I should render, for my part,\nA thankful heart;\nWhich, fired with incense, I resign,\nAs wholly thine;\n--But the acceptance, that must be,\nMy Christ, by Thee."}
