{"subject": "Wordless Pains", "text": "Like a wound-bleed, \nthe glacier falls in lonely \nsea. A river ages inside you, \ncollapsing in despairing loss.\n\nIt was not true, that \nyou live an impossible life.\nOn water you may not \nleave the footprints.\n\nBeyond human tragedy, \na knife falls on the gospels.\nStunned at the edge \nof tears, I tremble.\n\nAdieu to Arcadia.\nDust demands the price for \nred clover. A dark cloud envelops \nthe kind hills holding \nthe sun.\n\nIt casts a spell.\nA rock licks the moon."}
