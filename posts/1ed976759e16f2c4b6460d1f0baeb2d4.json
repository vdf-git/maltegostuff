{"subject": "Epitaph On The Lady Whitmore", "text": "Fair, kind, and true, a treasure each alone, \nA wife, a mistress, and a friend, in one; \nRest in this tomb, raised at thy husband's cost, \nHere sadly summing, what he had, and lost. \nCome, virgins, ere in equal bands ye join, \nCome first and offer at her sacred shrine; \nPray but for half the virtues of this wife, \nCompound for all the rest, with longer life; \nAnd wish your vows, like hers, may be returned, \nSo loved when living, and, when dead, so mourned."}
