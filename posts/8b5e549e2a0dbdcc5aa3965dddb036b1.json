{"subject": "Confessional", "text": "Now that I kneel at the throne, O Queen,\nPity and pardon me.\nMuch have I striven to sing the same,\nBrother of beast and tree;\nYet when the stars catch me alone\nNever a linnet sings- \nAnd the blood of a man is a bitter voice\nAnd cries for foolish things.\n\nNot for me be the vaunt of woe;\nWas not I from a boy\nVowed with the helmet and spear and spur\nTo the blood-red banner of joy?\nA man may sing his psalms to a stone,\nPour his blood for a weed,\nBut the tears of a man are a sudden thing,\nAnd come not of his creed.\n\nNay, but the earth is kind to me,\nThough I cry for a star,\nLeaves and grasses, feather and flower,\nCover the foolish scar,\nProphets and saints and seraphim\nLighten the load with song,\nAnd the heart of a man is a heavy load\nFor a man to bear along."}
