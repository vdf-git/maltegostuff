{"subject": "Sonnet Lxxxiii. To A Friend Concerned In Education.", "text": "Force not to over--growth the subject mind:\nHeaven's the power that spread the native soil;\nThe tillage only asks thy careful toil,\nOn primal strength dependent: if confined\nIn depth and barren, simple be thy seed,\nOf hardy grain: God's providence hath need\nOf some to marshal well the ranks behind,\nAs of the lofty spirits born to lead.\nBut if the tender plants of truth thou sow,\nLet there be depth of matter genial;\nAnd if the frosts should nip, and strong winds blow,\nTheir kindly opposites should countervail:\nBlest gifts, unfailing in their fostering might,\nSunshine by day, the dews of heaven by night."}
