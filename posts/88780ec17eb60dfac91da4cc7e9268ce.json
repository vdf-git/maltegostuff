{"subject": "Ode, Elegy, Aubade, Psalm", "text": "The songbird that escapes\nfrom a burning house\nwill build its nest \nin the shape of a cage.\n2\nThis is one thing\nwe know: song begs\nfor the places that make it\ngrow from seed to starling,\n3\nplaces that put the heart's hemlock\nin an empty rowboat \nand heave it from the shore.\n4\nWe only praise what we cannot\nkeep: violin strings berried with rain,\nteacups overflowing with brandywine, \nradios sickened with static.\n5\nGlass tossed out with the tide\nwill come back smoother and stranger,\nbut never to the same person.\n6\nThis is something we want\nto know. The woman in love\nnever touches her ears.\n7\nThe man in his house is always lost\nwithout her.\n8\nMorning pulls light\nfrom the dark like a boy\nhoisting a trout from the lake\nby its clean, pink gills.\n9\nWhen the woman escapes\nfrom a burning house\nshe will know the path of the wind,\n10\nhow it writes its scripture\nin peach blossoms blown\ninto a baby's empty pram.\n11\nShe'll feel it compose its words\nagainst her body, against the night,\nagainst the water, in an endless, artless psalm."}
