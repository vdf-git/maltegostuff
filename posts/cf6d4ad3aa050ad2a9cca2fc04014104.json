{"subject": "Rose And Murray", "text": "After the movie, when the lights come up, \nHe takes her powdered hand behind the wings; \nShe, all in yellow, like a buttercup, \nLifts her white face, yearns up to him, and clings; \nAnd with a silent, gliding step they move \nOver the footlights, in familiar glare, \nPanther-like in the Tango whirl of love, \nHe fawning close on her with idiot stare. \nSwiftly they cross the stage. O lyric ease! \nThe drunken music follows the sure feet, \nThe swaying elbows, intergliding knees, \nMoving with slow precision on the beat. \nShe was a waitress in a restaurant, \nHe picked her up and taught her how to dance. \nShe feels his arms, lifts an appealing glance, \nBut knows he spent last evening with Zudora; \nAnd knows that certain changes are before her.\n\nThe brilliant spotlight circles them around, \nFlashing the spangles on her weighted dress. \nHe mimics wooing her, without a sound, \nFlatters her with a smoothly smiled caress. \nHe fears that she will someday queer his act; \nFeeling his anger. He will quit her soon. \nHe nods for faster music. He will contract \nAnother partner, under another moon. \nMeanwhile, 'smooth stuff.' He lets his dry eyes flit \nOver the yellow faces there below; \nMaybe he'll cut down on his drinks a bit, \nNot to annoy her, and spoil the show. . . \nZudora, waiting for her turn to come, \nWatches them from the wings and fatly leers \nAt the girl's younger face, so white and dumb, \nAnd the fixed, anguished eyes, ready for tears.\n\nShe lies beside him, with a false wedding-ring, \nIn a cheap room, with moonlight on the floor; \nThe moonlit curtains remind her much of spring, \nOf a spring evening on the Coney shore. \nAnd while he sleeps, knowing she ought to hate, \nShe still clings to the lover that she knew,- \nThe one that, with a pencil on a plate, \nDrew a heart and wrote, 'I'd die for you.'"}
