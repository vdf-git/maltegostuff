{"subject": "Three-Fold", "text": "Somewhere I've read a thoughtful mind's reflection: \n 'All perfect things are three-fold'; and I know\nOur love has the rare symbol of perfection; \n The brain's response, the warm blood's rapturous glow, \nThe soul's sweet language, silent and unspoken.\n All these unite us with a deathless tie.\nFor when our frail, clay tenement is broken, \n Our spirits will be lovers still, on high.\n\nMy dearest wish, you speak before I word it.\n You understand the workings of heart.\nMy soul's thought, breathed where only God has heard it, \n You fathom with your strange divining art.\nAnd Like a fire, that cheers, and lights, and blesses, \n And floods a mansion full of happy heat, \nSo does the subtle warmth of your caresses, \n Pervade me with rapture, keen as sweet.\n\nAnd so sometimes, as you and I together\n Exult in all dear love's three-fold delights, \nI cannot help but vaguely wonder whether\n When our free souls attain their spirit heights, \nE'en if we reach that upper realm where God is, \n And find the tales of heavenly glory true, \nI wonder if we shall not miss our bodies, \n And long, at times, for hours on earth we knew.\n\nAs now, we sometimes pray to leave our prison\n And soar beyond all physical demands, \nSo may we not sigh, when we have arisen, \n For just one old-time touch of lips and hands? \nI know, dear heart, a thought like this seems daring\n Concerning God's vast Government above, \nYet, even There, I shrink from wholly sparing\n One element, from this, our Three-fold Love."}
