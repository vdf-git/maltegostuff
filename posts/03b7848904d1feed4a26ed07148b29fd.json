{"subject": "The Arrogant Frog And The Superior Bull", "text": "Once, on a time and in a place\nConducive to malaria,\nThere lived a member of the race\nOf \nRana Temporaria\n;\nOr, more concisely still, a frog\nInhabited a certain bog.\n\nA bull of Brobdingnagian size,\nToo proud for condescension,\nOne morning chanced to cast his eyes\nUpon the frog I mention;\nAnd, being to the manner born,\nSurveyed him with a lofty scorn.\n\nPerceiving this, the bactrian's frame\nWith anger was inflated,\nTill, growing larger, he became\nEgregiously elated;\nFor inspiration's sudden spell\nHad pointed out a way to swell.\n\n'Ha! ha!' he proudly cried, 'a fig\nFor this, your mammoth torso!\nJust watch me while I grow as big\nAs you-or even more so!'\nTo which magniloquential gush\nHis bullship simply answered 'Tush!'\n\nAlas! the frog's success was slight,\nWhich really was a wonder,\nIn view of how with main and might\nHe strove to grow rotunder!\nAnd, standing patiently the while,\nThe bull displayed a quiet smile.\nBut ah, the frog tried once too oft\nAnd, doing so, he busted;\nWhereat the bull discreetly coughed\nAnd moved away, disgusted,\nAs well he might, considering\nThe wretched taste that marked the thing.\n\nTHE MORAL: Everybody knows\nHow ill a wind it is that blows."}
