{"subject": "The Terrible Abstractions", "text": "The naked hunter's fist, bunched round his spear, \nWas tight and wet inside with sweat of fear; \nHe heard behind him what the hunted hear. \n\nThe silence in the undergrowth crept near; \nIts mischief tickled in his nervous ear \nAnd he became the prey, the quivering deer. \n\nThe naked hunter feared the threat he knew: \nBeing hunted, caught, then slaughtered like a ewe \nBy beasts who padded on four legs or two. \n\nThe naked hunter in the bus or queue \nUnder his decent wool is frightened too \nBut not of what his hairy forebear knew. \n\nThe terrible abstractions prowl about \nThe compound of his fear and chronic doubt; \nHe keeps fires burning boldly all night through, \nBut cannot keep the murderous shadows out."}
