{"subject": "I'M Going To Tell My Daddy On You", "text": "(This is a fictional poem) \n\nWhen people pick on me, I say 'I'm going to tell my daddy on you.'\nAll of my friends say that I shouldn't do that because I'm forty-two.\nWhen people bother me, I always tell my dad.\nHe spanks me because it makes him mad.\nLast week my neighbor's daughter stole my tricycle and I was riled.\nI started sucking my thumb and Daddy said I was acting like a child.\nPeople are wrong when they say I act like a child, a child wouldn't drive a Viper.\nBut on the other hand, I'm the only forty-two year old man who wears a diaper.\nDaddy told me to grow up and act like a man.\nI threw a tantrum because I don't think I can."}
