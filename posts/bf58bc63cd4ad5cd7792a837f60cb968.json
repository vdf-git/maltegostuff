{"subject": "The Challenge: A Court Ballad", "text": "I. \nTo one fair lady out of Court,\nAnd two fair ladies in,\nWho think the Turk and Pope a sport,\nAnd wit and love no sin!\nCome, these soft lines, with nothing stiff in,\nTo Bellenden, Lepell, and Griffin.\nWith a fa, la, la.\n\nII.\n\nWhat passes in the dark third row,\nAnd what behind the scene,\nCouches and crippled chairs I know,\nAnd garrets hung with green;\nI know the swing of sinful hack,\nWhere many damsels cry alack.\nWith a fa, la, la.\n\nIII.\nThen why to Courts should I repair,\nWhere's such ado with Townsend?\nTo hear each mortal stamp and swear,\nAnd every speech with 'Zounds' end;\nTo hear them rail at honest Sunderland,\nAnd rashly blame the realm of Blunderland.\nWith a fa, la, la.\n\nIV. \nAlas! like Schutz I cannot pun,\nLike Grafton court the Germans;\nTell Pickenbourg how slim she's grown,\nLike Meadows run to sermons;\nTo court ambitious men may roam,\nBut I and Marlbro' stay at home.\nWith a fa, la, la.\n\nV. \nIn truth, by what I can discern,\nOf courtiers, 'twixt you three,\nSome wit you have, and more may learn\nFrom Court, than Gay or Me:\nPerhaps, in time, you'll leave high diet,\nTo sup with us on milk and quiet.\nWith a fa, la, la.\n\nVI. \nAt Leicester Fields, a house full nigh,\nWith door all painted green,\n(A Milliner, I mean); \nThere may you meet us three to three,\nFor Gay can well make two of Me.\nWith a fa, la, la. \n\nVII. \nBut should you catch the prudish itch,\nAnd each become a coward,\nBring sometimes with you lady Rich,\nAnd sometimes mistress Howard;\nFor virgins, to keep chaste, must go\nAbroad with such as are not so.\nWith a fa, la, la.\n\nVIII.\nAnd thus, fair maids, my ballad ends;\nGod send the king safe landing;\nAnd make all honest ladies friends\nTo armies that are standing;\nPreserve the limits of those nations,\nAnd take off ladies' limitations.\nWith a fa, la, la."}
