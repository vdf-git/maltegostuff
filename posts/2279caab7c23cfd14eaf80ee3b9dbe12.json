{"subject": "Silence!", "text": "Silence! Silence! Can you even hear? \nListen to that song that you're playing in your ear\nDo you hear those chants that's trying take over your mind\nSubliminal messages and hidden words are all behind\n\nSilence! Silence! Do you even look? \nCan't you see the words that you're reading in that book\nWitchcraft, sorcery and all sort of spells\nMakes you get so caught up just to drag you straight to hell\n\nSilence! Silence! Do you even have eyes? \nCan't you see the world is feeding you a pack of lies? \nPlenty evil in high places but they're hidden in disguise.\nBlinding you with vanity and then try to take over your lives\n\nSilence! Silence! Can't you see that film? \nBe careful what you opening up yourself to and letting in\nTriangles, third-eye and all these kind of signs\nCover yourself with the blood of God, don't be fool my youths be wise!"}
