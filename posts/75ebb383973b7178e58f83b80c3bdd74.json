{"subject": "Shiloh - A Requiem", "text": "Skimming lightly, wheeling still,\nThe swallows fly low\nOver the field in clouded days,\nThe forest-field of Shiloh --\nOver the field where April rain\nSolaced the parched one stretched in pain\nThrough the pause of night\nThat followed the Sunday fight\nAround the church of Shiloh--\nThe church so lone, the log-built one,\nThat echoed to many a parting groan\nAnd natural prayer\nOf dying foemen mingled there --\nFoemen at morn, but friends at eve --\nFame or country least their care:\n(What like a bullet can undeceive!)\nBut now they lie low,\nWhile over them the swallows skim,\nAnd all is hushed at Shiloh."}
