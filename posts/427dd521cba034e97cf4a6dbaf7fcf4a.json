{"subject": "Psalm 46 Part 1", "text": "The church's safety and triumph among national desolation.\n\nGod is the refuge of his saints,\nWhen storms of sharp distress invade\nEre we can offer our complaints,\nBehold him present with his aid.\n\nLet mountains from their seats be hurled\nDown to the deep, and buried there,\nConvulsions shake the solid world,\nOur faith shall never yield to fear.\n\nLoud may the troubled ocean roar,\nIn sacred peace our souls abide,\nWhile every nation, every shore,\nTrembles, and dreads the swelling tide.\n\nThere is a stream, whose gentle flow\nSupplies the city of our God;\nLife, love, and joy still gliding through,\nAnd wat'ring our divine abode.\n\nThat sacred stream, thine holy word,\nThat all our raging fear controls:\nSweet peace thy promises afford,\nAnd give new strength to fainting souls.\n\nZion enjoys her Monarch's love,\nSecure against a threat'ning hour;\nNor can her firm foundations move,\nBuilt on his truth, and armed with power."}
