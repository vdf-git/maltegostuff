{"subject": "The Brethren Of Port Royal", "text": "Upon St. Mary's night\nWas met a holy band,\nIn prayer and fasting to unite\nFor their afflicted land;\nThe moon shone clear and pale\nUpon the house of prayer,\nAnd the solemn organ-tones did sail\nAlong the stedfast air.\nUpon a kneeling crowd\nThat silver radiance shone,\nWith hearts upraised and faces bow'd\nAt God's eternal throne;\nAnd strange was it to see,\nAs ye past their ranks along,\nThe difference and the unity\nOf that assembled throng.\nSome were in youth's first bloom,\nAnd some in manhood's prime,\nSome verging on the open tomb,\nAnd waiting God's good time;\nFrom ploughing summer's earth\nSome to those walls were come,\nAnd the high stamp of noble birth\nWas on the brows of some.\nBut a holy band they were,\u2014\nOne Lord, one faith, one heart,\nA brotherhood of praise and prayer,\nFrom the vain world apart:\nBeneath war's iron rod\nTheir groaning land was cast;\nBut in simple toils, and serving God,\nTheir quiet days they past.\nHard must it be to bow\nBeneath that stedfast chain,\nThough no irrevocable vow\nTheir willing hearts restrain.\nSeest thou yon kneeler there?\nAy, mark him well\u2014the hand\nNow clasp'd in penitential prayer\nOnce shook the knightly brand.\nDoes not that governed eye\nFull many a story tell\nOf struggle, strife, and victory,\nWon in his narrow cell;\nThe world's vain lore unlearned,\nIts vainer hopes unfelt?\u2014\nBut, ah, how the warrior-heart hath burned\nBeneath that iron belt!\nLong, long he strove to lift\nHis spirit with the psalm,\nPleading and striving for the gift\nOf patience, deep and calm;\nBut as upon the air\nThose soaring accents float,\nThere blended with the voice of prayer\nOne distant trumpet-note.\nLike to the purple gloom\nOf storm-clouds on the sea,\nWhen earth is silent as the tomb,\nAnd heaven frowns terribly,\nWas the darkness that o'erspread\nThat soldier-hermit's brow:\nHis eye is proud, his cheek is red\u2014\nHe's all the warrior now!\nLike to the sudden light\nUpon those storm-clouds breaking,\nWhen tempest rushes on the night,\nAnd hurricanes are waking,\nWas the spirit that returned \nTo his uplifted eye,\u2014\nA fire long stifled, but which burned\nOn its old hearth eagerly.\n\u201cUp, up!\u201d he cried, \u201cawake!\nGather for France\u2014for France!\nFor cowl, and staff, and crosier, take\nThe helmet and the lance!\nWe see our country bleed,\nWe hear the trumpet's tone,\nAnd how should we need a chief to lead?\u2014\nOur hearts shall lead us on!\nOur joyous land of France,\nOur lovely, our adored,\nShall she\u2014advance, my friends, advance!\u2014\nI cannot speak the word.\nThis is a holy war,\nGood angels on us smile;\nSoldiers we were, and monks we are,\nBut Frenchmen all the while!\nAnd our hands are now unbound,\nAnd we all are knights once more,\nAnd the old-forgotten cry shall sound,\n\u2018God and De Sericour!\u2019\u201d\nTheir hearts took up that cry;\nAnd, like a lion's roar,\nThe long aisles echo thunderingly,\n\u201cGod and De Sericour!\u201d\nAnd the anthem died away,\nAnd the sounds of prayer were lost:\nThe monks and the beadsmen, where are they?\u2014\nYe see an arm\u00e8d host!\nAn arm\u00e8d host ye see;\nFor, swift as light or thought,\nSome of its ancient panoply\nEach eager hand hath caught.\nLances were glimmering then;\nAnd, over silvery hair,\nUpon the brows of aged men\nThe helmet sparkled fair;\nBut dimm'd with many a stain,\nFor the rust had eaten through them:\nBut the spirits were themselves again,\nAnd how should man subdue them?\nThey march into the field,\nDe Sericour the first;\nOh, as his hand resumed the shield,\nSeemed that his heart would burst!\nBeneath the moon's pale lamp\nWar's business was begun,\nAnd the quiet vale became a camp\nBefore the dawn of sun.\nAnd the work of war went on,\nThere was hurrying to and fro,\nThe trumpet gave its cheering tone,\n\u201cSet forward on the foe!\u201d\nHow were their spirits stirred,\nAll panting to begin!\u2014\nBut lo, a calm, still voice is heard\u2014\nIt warneth them of sin!\nOf Christian love and hope,\nOf their adopted law,\nForbidding strife with strife to cope,\nIt speaks in holy awe;\nIt calls them to submit\nTo that accustomed yoke,\nAnd to weep that they rejected it,\u2014\nIt was De Sacy spoke.\nMutely they hear the word,\nAnd mutely all obey;\nCuirass, and lance, and helm, and sword,\nAt once are flung away;\nAnd the noon-tide sun shines bright\nUpon an altered scene,\nThe vale lies placid in its light\nAs it hath ever been!\nGone\u2014like an April-gleam\nWhen storms are gathering fast!\nIt is like waking from a dream!\nThat wondrous change hath past.\nAnd the daily toils went on,\nAs if they ne'er had ceased,\nAnd the organ with its stately tone\nGave answer to the priest.\nWho first did from him cast\nThe weapon that he wore?\n'Twas he whom man would name the last\u2014\nIt was De Sericour!\nHis lofty head is bow'd\n'Neath a heavier weight than years,\nThe eye that was so brightly proud\nIs quench'd in sudden tears!\nAnd penitence resumes\nHer intermitted sway,\nAnd swift forgetfulness entombs\nThe deeds of that bright day.\nAh, no! The thought can be\nFrom the deep heart banish'd never;\n'Twas the captive's glimpse of liberty,\nSeen once and lost for ever!\nScorn we a heart like his,\nAt God's own footstool laid?\nForget not that of stuff like this\nMartyrs and saints were made!\nBut our words are bold and free,\nWe judge, decide, condemn\u2014\nAh, God forgive us!\u2014what are we \nThat we should sentence them?"}
