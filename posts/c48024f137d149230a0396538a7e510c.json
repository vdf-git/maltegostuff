{"subject": "Saadi", "text": "Trees in groves,\nKine in droves,\nIn ocean sport the scaly herds,\nWedge-like cleave the air the birds,\nTo northern lakes fly wind-borne ducks,\nBrowse the mountain sheep in flocks,\nMen consort in camp and town,\nBut the poet dwells alone.\n\nGod who gave to him the lyre,\nOf all mortals the desire,\nFor all breathing men's behoof,\nStraitly charged him, \"Sit aloof;\"\nAnnexed a warning, poets say,\nTo the bright premium,\u2014\nEver when twain together play,\nShall the harp be dumb.\nMany may come,\nBut one shall sing;\nTwo touch the string,\nThe harp is dumb.\nThough there come a million\nWise Saadi dwells alone.\n\nYet Saadi loved the race of men,\u2014\nNo churl immured in cave or den,\u2014\nIn bower and hall\nHe wants them all,\nNor can dispense\nWith Persia for his audience;\nThey must give ear,\nGrow red with joy, and white with fear,\nYet he has no companion,\nCome ten, or come a million,\nGood Saadi dwells alone.\n\nBe thou ware where Saadi dwells.\nGladly round that golden lamp\nSylvan deities encamp,\nAnd simple maids and noble youth\nAre welcome to the man of truth.\nMost welcome they who need him most,\nThey feed the spring which they exhaust:\nFor greater need\nDraws better deed:\nBut, critic, spare thy vanity,\nNor show thy pompous parts,\nTo vex with odious subtlety\nThe cheerer of men's hearts.\n\nSad-eyed Fakirs swiftly say\nEndless dirges to decay;\nNever in the blaze of light\nLose the shudder of midnight;\nAnd at overflowing noon,\nHear wolves barking at the moon;\nIn the bower of dalliance sweet\nHear the far Avenger's feet;\nAnd shake before those awful Powers\nWho in their pride forgive not ours.\nThus the sad-eyed Fakirs preach;\n\"Bard, when thee would Allah teach,\nAnd lift thee to his holy mount,\nHe sends thee from his bitter fount,\nWormwood; saying, Go thy ways,\nDrink not the Malaga of praise,\nBut do the deed thy fellows hate,\nAnd compromise thy peaceful state.\nSmite the white breasts which thee fed,\nStuff sharp thorns beneath the head\nOf them thou shouldst have comforted.\nFor out of woe and out of crime\nDraws the heart a lore sublime.\"\nAnd yet it seemeth not to me\nThat the high gods love tragedy;\nFor Saadi sat in the sun,\nAnd thanks was his contrition;\nFor haircloth and for bloody whips,\nHad active hands and smiling lips;\nAnd yet his runes he rightly read,\nAnd to his folk his message sped.\nSunshine in his heart transferred\nLighted each transparent word;\nAnd well could honoring Persia learn\nWhat Saadi wished to say;\nFor Saadi's nightly stars did burn\nBrighter than Dschami's day.\n\nWhispered the muse in Saadi's cot;\nO gentle Saadi, listen not,\nTempted by thy praise of wit,\nOr by thirst and appetite\nFor the talents not thine own,\nTo sons of contradiction.\nNever, sun of eastern morning,\nFollow falsehood, follow scorning,\nDenounce who will, who will, deny,\nAnd pile the hills to scale the sky;\nLet theist, atheist, pantheist,\nDefine and wrangle how they list,\u2014\nFierce conserver, fierce destroyer,\nBut thou joy-giver and enjoyer,\nUnknowing war, unknowing crime,\nGentle Saadi, mind thy rhyme.\nHeed not what the brawlers say,\nHeed thou only Saadi's lay.\n\nLet the great world bustle on\nWith war and trade, with camp and town.\nA thousand men shall dig and eat,\nAt forge and furnace thousands sweat,\nAnd thousands sail the purple sea,\nAnd give or take the stroke of war,\nOr crowd the market and bazaar.\nOft shall war end, and peace return,\nAnd cities rise where cities burn,\nEre one man my hill shall climb,\nWho can turn the golden rhyme;\nLet them manage how they may,\nHeed thou only Saadi's lay.\nSeek the living among the dead:\nMan in man is imprisoned.\nBarefooted Dervish is not poor,\nIf fate unlock his bosom's door.\nSo that what his eye hath seen\nHis tongue can paint, as bright, as keen,\nAnd what his tender heart hath felt,\nWith equal fire thy heart shall melt.\nFor, whom the muses shine upon,\nAnd touch with soft persuasion,\nHis words like a storm-wind can bring\nTerror and beauty on their wing;\nIn his every syllable\nLurketh nature veritable;\nAnd though he speak in midnight dark,\nIn heaven, no star; on earth, no spark;\nYet before the listener's eye\nSwims the world in ecstasy,\nThe forest waves, the morning breaks,\nThe pastures sleep, ripple the lakes,\nLeaves twinkle, flowers like persons be,\nAnd life pulsates in rock or tree.\nSaadi! so far thy words shall reach;\nSuns rise and set in Saadi's speech.\n\nAnd thus to Saadi said the muse;\nEat thou the bread which men refuse;\nFlee from the goods which from thee flee;\nSeek nothing; Fortune seeketh thee.\nNor mount, nor dive; all good things keep\nThe midway of the eternal deep;\nWish not to fill the isles with eyes\nTo fetch thee birds of paradise;\nOn thine orchard's edge belong\nAll the brass of plume and song;\nWise Ali's sunbright sayings pass\nFor proverbs in the market-place;\nThrough mountains bored by regal art\nToil whistles as he drives his cart.\nNor scour the seas, nor sift mankind,\nA poet or a friend to find;\nBehold, he watches at the door,\nBehold his shadow on the floor.\nOpen innumerable doors,\nThe heaven where unveiled Allah pours\nThe flood of truth, the flood of good,\nThe seraph's and the cherub's food;\nThose doors are men; the pariah kind\nAdmits thee to the perfect Mind.\nSeek not beyond thy cottage wall\nRedeemer that can yield thee all.\nWhile thou sittest at thy door,\nOn the desert's yellow floor,\nListening to the gray-haired crones,\nFoolish gossips, ancient drones,\u2014\nSaadi, see, they rise in stature\nTo the height of mighty nature,\nAnd the secret stands revealed\nFraudulent Time in vain concealed,\nThat blessed gods in servile masks\nPlied for thee thy household tasks."}
