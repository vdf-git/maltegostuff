{"subject": "I Don't Miss It", "text": "But sometimes I forget where I am,\nImagine myself inside that life again.\n\nRecalcitrant mornings. Sun perhaps,\nOr more likely colorless light\n\nFiltering its way through shapeless cloud.\n\nAnd when I begin to believe I haven't left,\nThe rest comes back. Our couch. My smoke\n\nClimbing the walls while the hours fall.\nStraining against the noise of traffic, music,\n\nAnything alive, to catch your key in the door.\nAnd that scamper of feeling in my chest,\n\nAs if the day, the night, wherever it is\nI am by then, has been only a whir\n\nOf something other than waiting.\n\nWe hear so much about what love feels like.\nRight now, today, with the rain outside,\n\nAnd leaves that want as much as I do to believe\nIn May, in seasons that come when called,\n\nIt's impossible not to want\nTo walk into the next room and let you\n\nRun your hands down the sides of my legs,\nKnowing perfectly well what they know."}
