{"subject": "By Her White Bed", "text": "By her white bed I muse a little space:\nShe fell asleep--not very long ago,--\nAnd yet the grass was here and not the snow--\nThe leaf, the bud, the blossom, and--her face!--\nMidsummer's heaven above us, and the grace\nOf Lovers own day, from dawn to afterglow;\nThe fireflies' glimmering, and the sweet and low\nPlaint of the whip-poor-wills, and every place\nIn thicker twilight for the roses' scent.\nThen _night_.--She slept--in such tranquility,\nI walk atiptoe still, nor _dare_ to weep,\nFeeling, in all this hush, she rests content--\nThat though God stood to wake her for me, she\nWould mutely plead: 'Nay, Lord! Let _him_ so sleep.'"}
