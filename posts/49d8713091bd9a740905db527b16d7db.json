{"subject": "What I Have Seen #3", "text": "I saw two youths: both were fair in the face,\nThey had set out foot to foot in life's race;\nBut one said to the other, 'I say now, my brother,\nYou are going a little too slow;\nThe world will look on, and say, 'See Josy John,'\nWe must put on more style, now, you know.'\nSo he tipped a plug hat on one side of his pate,\nAnd strutted along with a Jockey Club gait;\nAnd he carried a cane, and said, 'It is plain,\nI am too fine a fellow to toil.\nI can gamble and bet, and a good living get;\nBut my hands are too pretty to soil.\n'My friend in the rear, you are slow, I am fast;\nI am up with the times-I am first, you are last.\nSo I guess I will leave you-aw, if it won't grieve you;\nI'll wait for you when I get through;\nOr, when up on the hill, I'll remem-bah you still,\nAnd-aw, mayhap I'll come and help you.'\nI saw him pass on with a strut through the street;\nSaw him stopped by a score of 'good boys' for a treat.\nWhile the calm 'Josy John' went quietly on,\nAnd kept his lips free from the bowl;\nWorked at whatever came, turned from sin and from shame,\nAnd wrote 'Purity,' 'Truth,' in his soul.\nI saw two men: one was fair to behold;\nThe other, a drunken sot, bloated and bold.\nOne stood on the mountain and drank of God's fountain,\nThe other drank beer in the street.\nYet both started alike; but one made a 'strike,'\nWhich ended, you see, in defeat."}
