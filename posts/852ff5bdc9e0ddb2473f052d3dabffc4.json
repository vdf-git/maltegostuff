{"subject": "The Coast Of Cornwall", "text": "For me, true son of Erin, thou art rife,\nGrand coast of Cornwall, cliff, and cave, and surge,\nWith glamour of the Kelt. Strong sons at strife\nWith wind and wave if healthier influence purge\nNot wholly yet from wrecker's blood, nor merge\nAll in mild manners, yet there do not fail\nAncestral hero hearts and lives to urge\nTheir native virtue, that will never pale\nIn any strait, nor cringe, nor need to wear a veil. \n\nTired hearts' refreshment, friend, glad life was mine\nHearing rich music in Lamorna's bower;\nAnd where thy whelming tawny dunes incline\nSaint Piran! waveward, many a siren hour\nMe and my village friend through shine and shower\nCrowned, pacing level sands by foamy flood; \nTintagel, thy dark legendary tower\nDreams o'er the seas of Tristram and Isoud;\nBy cliff and cavern gleam Romance's aery brood!\n\nToward thee, wild Treryn Dinas, oft I steer,\nFrom whose weird form wake melancholy wings\nOf cloudy memories divinely dear;\nThou lookest all unutterable things,\nHaunt of some mystic atmosphere that clings\nFrom faintly-imagined, vanished Druid time,\nWhile a low wind, like one demented, sings,\nOr murmurs a lorn, incoherent rhyme\nOf mariners wrecked here since Earth was in her prime.\n\nI love Bedruthan's frowning, storm-swept steep,\nSaint Columb's minster-caverned purple gloom,\nWhere bosoms of the babe-waves heave in sleep:\nAround Tol-Pedn's sombre height they boom;\nThrough tall fantastic arches glancing foam;\nBy grey Saint Levan, surge-ringed Rundlestone,\nWhose bell wave-tolled hath learned sad sounds from Doom,\nHow often do I wander all alone,\nWith quest bewildered hearing the sea's monotone!"}
