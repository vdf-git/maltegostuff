{"subject": "Doom Of Beauty", "text": "CHOICE soul, in whom, as in a glass, we see, \nMirrored in thy pure form and delicate, \nWhat beauties heaven and nature can create, \nThe paragon of all their works to be! \nFair soul, in whom love, pity, piety, \nHave found a home, as from thy outward state \nWe clearly read, and are so rare and great \nThat they adorn none other like to thee! \nLove takes me captive; beauty binds my soul; \nPity and mercy with their gentle eyes \nWake in my heart a hope that cannot cheat. \nWhat law, what destiny, what fell control, \nWhat cruelty, or late or soon, denies \nThat death should spare perfection so complete?"}
