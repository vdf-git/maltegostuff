{"subject": "May Seventeenth", "text": "Wergeland's statue on May seventeenth\nSaw the procession. And as its rear-guard,\nSlow marching masses,\nStrong men, and women with flower-decked presence;\nCome now the peasants, come now the peasants.\n\n\u00d6sterdal's forest's magnificent chieftain\nBore the old banner. Soon as we see it\nBlood-red uplifted,\nGreet it the thousands in thought of its story:\nThat is our glory, that is our glory!\n\nNever that lion bore crown that was foreign,\nNever that cloth was by Dannebrog cloven.\nI saw the \nfuture\n,\nWhen with that banner by Wergeland's column\nPeasants stood solemn, peasants stood solemn.\n\nMost of our loss in the times that have vanished,\nMost of our victories, most of our longing,\nMost that is vital:\nDeeds of the past and the future's bold daring\nPeasants are bearing, peasants are bearing.\n\nSorely they suffered for sins once committed,\nBut they arise now. Here in the Storting\nStalwart they prove it,\nAll, as they come from our land's every region,\nPeasants Norwegian, peasants Norwegian.\n\nHold what they won, with a will to go farther;\nWhole we must have independence and honor!\nAll of us know it:\nWergeland's summer bears soon its best flower,-\nPower in peasants, peasants in power."}
