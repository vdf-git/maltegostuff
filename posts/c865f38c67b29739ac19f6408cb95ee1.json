{"subject": "Trysting Time", "text": "I\n\nA pretty girl at time o' gloaming\nHath whispered me to go and meet her\nWithout the city gate.\nI love her, but she tarries coming.\nShall I return, or stay and greet her?\nI burn, and wait.\nII\n\nTruly she charmeth all beholders,\n'Tis she hath given me this jewel,\nThe jade of my delight;\nBut this red jewel-jade that smoulders,\nTo my desire doth add more fuel,\nNew charms to-night.\nIII\n\nShe has gathered with her lily fingers\nA lily fair and rare to see.\nOh! sweeter still the fragrance lingers\nFrom the warm hand that gave it me."}
