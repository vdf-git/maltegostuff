{"subject": "Professor Minto", "text": "Nature, that makes Professors all day long,\nAnd, filling idle souls with idle song,\nTurns out small Poets every other minute,\nMade earth for men--but seldom puts men in it.\n\nAh, Minto, thou of that minority\nWert man of men--we had deep need of thee!\nHad Heaven a deeper? Did the heavenly Chair\nOf Earthly Love wait empty for thee there?"}
