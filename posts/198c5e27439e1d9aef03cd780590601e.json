{"subject": "Heart And Hearth", "text": "We sat and watched the hearth-fire blaze,\nMy friend and I together;\nThe crickets sang of harvest-days,\nThe wood of summer weather.\n\nIt told of shade, of storm and sun,\nIts native oakland story;\nTo him it only spake of one\nWho turned all gloom to glory.\n\nThe cricket carolled still of noon,\nBright with the sun\u2019s caresses\nTo him it called a form like June,\nAflush with golden tresses.\n\nWithin the flame a spirit seemed\nTo soar and sway and falter,\nWhile in his heart a presence beamed\nMore steadfast on its altar.\n\nThe embers, in their ashen bed,\nLooked out with transient flashes;\nHe only saw sweet eyes that shed\nTheir rays through twilight lashes.\n\nO\u2019er stubbled fields the autumn wailed,\nIn low and mournful closes;\nHe only heard a song that sailed\nOver charmed realms of roses.\n\nHis eyes, once lit with battle-ire,\nAflame with warrior science,\nForgot their fierce, controlling fire,\nTheir flashes of defiance;\n\nBut with dreamy love-light blest,\nMore luminous grew and tender,\nAs if the image in his breast\nHad lit them with its splendor.\n\nThe voice that once his ardor proved,\nAlong the roaring column,\nNow to mysterious measures moved\nSubdued, serenely solemn.\n\nHe named her, \u2014and the soft words came\nIn musical completeness,\nAs if the breathing of that name\nHad touched his lips with sweetness."}
