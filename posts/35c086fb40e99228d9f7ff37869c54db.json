{"subject": "Strip Teaser", "text": "My precious grand-child, aged two,\nIs eager to unlace one shoe,\n          And then the other;\nHer cotton socks she'll deftly doff\nDespite the mild reproaches of\n          Her mother.\n\nAround the house she loves to fare,\nAnd with her rosy tootsies bare,\n          Pit-pat the floor;\nAnd though remonstrances we make\nShe presently decides to take\n          Off something more.\n\nHer pinafore she next unties,\nAnd then before we realise,\n          Her dress drops down;\nHer panties and her brassiere,\nHer chemise and her underwear\n          Are round her strown.\n\nAnd now she dances all about,\nAs naked as a new-caught trout,\n          With impish glee;\nAnd though she's beautiful like that,\n(A cherubim, but not so fat),\n          Quite shocked are we.\n\nAnd so we dread with dim dismay\nSome day she may her charms display\n          In skimpy wear;\nAye, even in a gee-string she\nMay frolic on the stage of the\n          Folies-B\u00e8rgere\n\nBut e'er she does, I hope she'll read\nThis worldly wise and warning screed,\n          That to conceal,\nUnto the ordinary man\nIs often more alluring than\n          To ALL reveal."}
