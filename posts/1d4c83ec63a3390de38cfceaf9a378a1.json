{"subject": "Trailing War", "text": "In search of peace\nthe free hand was inflicting casualities.\nThe kids were buried like insects in a rubble.\n\nStep by step in speculation\nthe streets were livid with rustic murals\nof splintered blood on walls.\n\nThe foxgloves had lobbed rockets\non tall heads. Beleaguered\neyes nailed to fire.\n\nI am watching you my art, \nto witness the agony of man.\nBurn, burn my cupped hands with snatched words."}
