{"subject": "Sonnet. Dry Those Fair, Those Chrystal Eyes", "text": "Dry those fair, those chrystal eyes \nWhich like growing fountains rise \nTo drown their banks. Griefs sullen brooks \nWould better flow in furrow'd looks. \nThy lovely face was never meant \nTo be the shoar of discontent. \nThen clear those watrish starres again \nWhich else portend a lasting rain; \nLest the clouds which settle there \nProlong my Winter all the Year: \nAnd the example others make \nIn love with sorrow for thy sake."}
