{"subject": "Eden", "text": "A learned and a happy ignorance\nDivided me\nFrom all the vanity,\nFrom all the sloth, care, pain, and sorrow that advance\nThe madness and the misery\nOf men. No error, no distraction I\nSaw soil the earth, or overcloud the sky.\n\nI knew not that there was a serpent's sting,\nWhose poison shed\nOn men, did overspread\nThe world; nor did I dream of such a thing\nAs sin, in which mankind lay dead.\nThey all were brisk and living wights to me,\nYea, pure and full of immortality.\n\nJoy, pleasure, beauty, kindness, glory, love,\nSleep, day, life, light,\nPeace, melody, my sight,\nMy ears and heart did fill and freely move.\nAll that I saw did me delight.\nThe Universe was then a world of treasure,\nTo me an universal world of pleasure.\n\nUnwelcome penitence was then unknown,\nVain costly toys,\nSwearing and roaring boys,\nShops, markets, taverns, coaches, were unshown;\nSo all things were that drown'd my joys:\nNo thorns chok'd up my path, nor hid the face\nOf bliss and beauty, nor eclips'd the place.\n\nOnly what Adam in his first estate,\nDid I behold;\nHard silver and dry gold\nAs yet lay under ground; my blessed fate\nWas more acquainted with the old\nAnd innocent delights which he did see\nIn his original simplicity.\n\nThose things which first his Eden did adorn,\nMy infancy\nDid crown. Simplicity\nWas my protection when I first was born.\nMine eyes those treasures first did see\nWhich God first made. The first effects of love\nMy first enjoyments upon earth did prove;\n\nAnd were so great, and so divine, so pure;\nSo fair and sweet,\nSo true; when I did meet\nThem here at first, they did my soul allure,\nAnd drew away my infant feet\nQuite from the works of men; that I might see\nThe glorious wonders of the Deity."}
