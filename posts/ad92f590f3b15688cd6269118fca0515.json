{"subject": "The Hills Of Rest", "text": "Beyond the last horizon's rim \nBeyond adventure's farthest quest, \nSomewhere they rise, serene and dim, \nThe happy, happy Hills of Rest. \n\nUpon their sunlit slopes uplift \nThe castles we have built in Spain- \nWhile fair amid the summer drift \nOur faded gardens flower again. \n\nSweet hours we did not live go by \nTo soothing note, on scented wing; \nIn golden-lettered volumes lie \nThe songs we tried in vain to sing. \n\nThey are all there, the days of dream \nThat build the inner lives of men; \nThe silent, sacred years we deem \nThe might be and the might have been. \n\nSome evening when the sky is gold \nI'll follow day into the west; \nNor pause, nor heed, till I behold \nThe happy, happy Hills of Rest."}
