{"subject": "Farewell Lines To Bristol Hot Wells", "text": "Bristol! in vain thy rocks attempt the sky,\nThe wild woods waving on their giddy brow;\nAnd vainly, devious Avon! vainly sigh\nThy waters, winding thro' the vales below;-\n\nIn vain, upon thy glassy bosom borne,\nTh' expected vessel proudly glides along,\nWhile, 'mid thy echoes, at the break of morn\nIs heard the homeward ship-boy's happy song;-\n\nFor, ah! amid thy sweet romantic shade,\nBy Friendship led, fair drooping Beauty moves;\nThy hallow'd cup of health affords no aid,\nNor charm thy birds, that chant their woodland loves.\n\nEach morn I view her thro' thy wave-girt grove,\nHer white robe flutt'ring round her sinking form;\nO'er the sweet ruin shine those eyes of love,\nAs bright stars beaming thro' a midnight storm.\n\nHere sorrowing Love seeks a sequester'd bow'r.\nCalls on thy spring to calm his troubled breast;\nBright Hope alights not on his pensive hour,\nNor can thy favour'd fountains yield him rest.\n\nDespair across his joys now intervenes,\nAnd sternly bids the little cherub fly;\nWhile his eyes close amid thy beauteous scenes.\nHis last sighs bless the form that bids him die.\n\nFarewell, then, Bristol! thou canst yield no joy,\nThy woods look darken'd with funereal gloom,\nSickness and Sorrow on thy green banks sigh,\nAnd all thy form is but a beauteous tomb.\n\nAh! may each future suff'rer, hov'ring near,\nRais'd by thy genial wave, delighted view\nReturning joy and health, supremely dear,\nLong lost to him who sadly sighs adieu!"}
