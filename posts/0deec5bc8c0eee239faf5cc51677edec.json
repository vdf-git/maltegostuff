{"subject": "Stars", "text": "Ah! why, because the dazzling sun\nRestored our Earth to joy,\nHave you departed, every one,\nAnd left a desert sky? \n\nAll through the night, your glorious eyes\nWere gazing down in mine,\nAnd, with a full heart's thankful sighs,\nI blessed that watch divine. \n\nI was at peace, and drank your beams\nAs they were life to me;\nAnd revelled in my changeful dreams,\nLike petrel on the sea. \n\nThought followed thought, star followed star\nThrough boundless regions on;\nWhile one sweet influence, near and far,\nThrilled through, and proved us one! \n\nWhy did the morning dawn to break\nSo great, so pure a spell;\nAnd scorch with fire the tranquil cheek,\nWhere your cool radiance fell? \n\nBlood-red, he rose, and arrow-straight,\nHis fierce beams struck my brow;\nThe soul of nature sprang, elate,\nBut mine sank sad and low. \n\nMy lids closed down, yet through their veil\nI saw him, blazinig, still,\nAnd steep in gold the misty dale,\nAnd flash upon the hill. \n\nI turned me to the pillow, then,\nTo call back night, and see\nYour words of solemn light, again,\nThrob with my heart, and me! \n\nIt would not do - the pillow glowed,\nAnd glowed both roof and floor;\nAnd birds sang loudly in the wood,\nAnd fresh winds shook the door; \n\nThe curtains waved, the wakened flies\nWere murmuring round my room,\nImprisoned there, till I should rise,\nAnd give them leave to roam. \n\nO stars, and dreams, and gentle night;\nO night and stars, return!\nAnd hide me from the hostile light\nThat does not warm, but burn; \n\nThat drains the blood of suffering men;\nDrinks tears, instead of dew;\nLet me sleep through his blinding reign,\nAnd only wake with you!"}
