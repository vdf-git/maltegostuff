{"subject": "Subway Theology", "text": "Bishop Potter, finding hotter\nPassions than there used to be,\nTo the Gospel bids defiance,\nAnd appeals to modern science\nFor the remedy.\nSaint and devil on a level\nWalked of late where all men saw;\nBut the wise, by his example,\nTravel now a subway ample.\nPaved with fragments of the law.\nHere this up-to-date instructor\nGives each clerical conductor\nTransfers for the nuptial route,\nSo that they who feel the folly\nOf the matrimonial trolley\nMay, at will, get out."}
