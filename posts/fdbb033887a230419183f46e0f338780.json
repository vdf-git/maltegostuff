{"subject": "Veneta Marina", "text": "The masts rise white to the stars,\nWhite on the night of the sky,\nOut of the water's night,\nAnd the stars lean down to them white.\nAh! how the stars seem nigh;\nHow far away are the stars!\n\nAnd I too under the stars,\nAlone with the night again,\nAnd the water's monotone;\nI and the night alone,\nAnd the world and the ways of men\nFarther from me than the stars."}
