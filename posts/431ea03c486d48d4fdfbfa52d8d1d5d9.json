{"subject": "The Delectable Ballad Of The Waller Lot", "text": "Up yonder in Buena Park\nThere is a famous spot,\nIn legend and in history\nYclept the Waller Lot.\n\nThere children play in daytime\nAnd lovers stroll by dark,\nFor 't is the goodliest trysting-place\nIn all Buena Park.\n\nOnce on a time that beauteous maid,\nSweet little Sissy Knott,\nTook out her pretty doll to walk\nWithin the Waller Lot.\n\nWhile thus she fared, from Ravenswood\nCame Injuns o'er the plain,\nAnd seized upon that beauteous maid\nAnd rent her doll in twain.\n\nOh, 't was a piteous thing to hear\nHer lamentations wild;\nShe tore her golden curls and cried:\n\"My child! My child! My child!\"\n\nAlas, what cared those Injun chiefs\nHow bitterly wailed she?\nThey never had been mothers,\nAnd they could not hope to be!\n\n\"Have done with tears,\" they rudely quoth,\nAnd then they bound her hands;\nFor they proposed to take her off\nTo distant border lands.\n\nBut, joy! from Mr. Eddy's barn\nDoth Willie Clow behold\nThe sight that makes his hair rise up\nAnd all his blood run cold.\n\nHe put his fingers in his mouth\nAnd whistled long and clear,\nAnd presently a goodly horde\nOf cow-boys did appear.\n\nCried Willie Clow: \"My comrades bold,\nHaste to the Waller Lot,\nAnd rescue from that Injun band\nOur charming Sissy Knott!\"\n\n\"Spare neither Injun buck nor squaw,\nBut smite them hide and hair!\nSpare neither sex nor age nor size,\nAnd no condition spare!\"\n\nThen sped that cow-boy band away,\nFull of revengeful wrath,\nAnd Kendall Evans rode ahead\nUpon a hickory lath.\n\nAnd next came gallant Dady Field\nAnd Willie's brother Kent,\nThe Eddy boys and Robbie James,\nOn murderous purpose bent.\n\nFor they were much beholden to\nThat maid - in sooth, the lot\nWere very, very much in love\nWith charming Sissy Knott.\n\nWhat wonder? She was beauty's queen,\nAnd good beyond compare;\nMoreover, it was known she was\nHer wealthy father's heir!\n\nNow when the Injuns saw that band\nThey trembled with affright,\nAnd yet they thought the cheapest thing\nTo do was stay and fight.\n\nSo sturdily they stood their ground,\nNor would their prisoner yield,\nDespite the wrath of Willie Clow\nAnd gallant Dady Field.\n\nOh, never fiercer battle raged\nUpon the Waller Lot,\nAnd never blood more freely flowed\nThan flowed for Sissy Knott!\n\nAn Injun chief of monstrous size\nGot Kendall Evans down,\nAnd Robbie James was soon o'erthrown\nBy one of great renown.\n\nAnd Dady Field was sorely done,\nAnd Willie Clow was hurt,\nAnd all that gallant cow-boy band\nLay wallowing in the dirt.\n\nBut still they strove with might and main\nTill all the Waller Lot\nWas strewn with hair and gouts of gore -\nAll, all for Sissy Knott!\n\nThen cried the maiden in despair:\n\"Alas, I sadly fear\nThe battle and my hopes are lost,\nUnless some help appear!\"\n\nLo, as she spoke, she saw afar\nThe rescuer looming up -\nThe pride of all Buena Park,\nClow's famous yellow pup!\n\n\"Now, sick'em, Don,\" the maiden cried,\n\"Now, sick'em, Don!\" cried she;\nObedient Don at once complied -\nAs ordered, so did he.\n\nHe sicked'em all so passing well\nThat, overcome by fright,\nThe Indian horde gave up the fray\nAnd safety sought in flight.\n\nThey ran and ran and ran and ran\nO'er valley, plain, and hill;\nAnd if they are not walking now,\nWhy, then, they're running still.\n\nThe cow-boys rose up from the dust\nWith faces black and blue;\n\"Remember, beauteous maid,\" said they,\n\"We've bled and died for you!\"\n\n\"And though we suffer grievously,\nWe gladly hail the lot\nThat brings us toils and pains and wounds\nFor charming Sissy Knott!\"\n\nBut Sissy Knott still wailed and wept,\nAnd still her fate reviled;\nFor who could patch her dolly up -\nWho, who could mend her child?\n\nThen out her doting mother came,\nAnd soothed her daughter then;\n\"Grieve not, my darling, I will sew\nYour dolly up again!\"\n\nJoy soon succeeded unto grief,\nAnd tears were soon dried up,\nAnd dignities were heaped upon\nClow's noble yellow pup.\n\nHim all that goodly company\nDid as deliverer hail -\nThey tied a ribbon round his neck,\nAnother round his tail.\n\nAnd every anniversary day\nUpon the Waller Lot\nThey celebrate the victory won\nFor charming Sissy Knott.\n\nAnd I, the poet of these folk,\nAm ordered to compile\nThis truly famous history\nIn good old ballad style.\n\nWhich having done as to have earned\nThe sweet rewards of fame,\nIn what same style I did begin\nI now shall end the same.\n\nSo let us sing: Long live the King,\nLong live the Queen and Jack,\nLong live the ten-spot and the ace,\nAnd also all the pack."}
