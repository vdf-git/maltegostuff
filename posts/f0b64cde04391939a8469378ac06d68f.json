{"subject": "Poem For A Coin", "text": "strange coin I would call bronze\non what feels like earth's last morning\nI stand in the kitchen just holding\nyour slight warmth in my palm\ntrying now to remember\nfrom what country I removed you\nmaybe Slovenia or terrible Spain\nyou clink against the gold\nI wear on the finger known as ring\non one side a number on the other\nsome famous candelabra\na solemn crowd once a year\nalong the main avenue carried\nto celebrate Night the considerate guest\nthat while we are sleeping quietly\ntakes its clouds and departs\nor a shield that long ago\nprotected a prince from an arrow\nso he could become the cruel\norganizer whose roads to this day\nwe still unthinking travel\nstrange coin I am asking\nwhose hands without marveling\nheld you on their way\nthough you know you cannot answer\nsome mornings I wander out\nbelow the sun scare some crows\ngrab a spade and make a hole\nplace some seeds or a whole plant\nmy wife tells me what to do\nshe is holding an orange can\nfull of clear miraculous water\nher dark hair her white skin\nafter a funeral I have seen\nloved ones ritually pound\ndirt with shovels to make the rectangular\nhole flat and ready for the stone\nwe can return to each time\nto place some object that attracts our eye\nfor some reason we cannot explain\nto wish the souls we don't know\nif we believe in to nowhere\nsafe journey just in case\nwherever they are they will know\nthey are thought of and remembered"}
