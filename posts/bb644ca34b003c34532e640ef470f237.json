{"subject": "The Looking Glass", "text": "With sleepy eyes I looked in to the \nlooking glass and could barely see \na stranger looking back at me. \nWith no brow hair in place \nonly a rim of gray hair to brim his face. \nFather time has put a roadmap \nupon his face a hollow here and \nthere and his are just a stare. Putting on my glasses I can \nclearly see it is a reflection of \nits real me. Father time has taken it's toll. \nWhere the time went I do not know. \nWhat hair I have is white as \nsnow, my walk is very slow. \nFather time will do that to you too. Some day you will see that \nstranger looking back at you. \nI looked into that same looking \nglass many years ago, there was \nno strange to be found. \nMy hair was sandy brown and \nwaves all around. When I was young there words \nwere true as gold. \nBut it is plain to see I have \ngrown old. My children no longer young \nhave grown straight and tall. \nNow I can truly say \nThank You Lord it has \nbeen worth it all"}
