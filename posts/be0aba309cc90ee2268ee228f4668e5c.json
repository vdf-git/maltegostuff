{"subject": "Visions", "text": "All the tears that I have shed, \nAll my kisses, lo, they pass \nThro' my mind as in a glass: \nAll my kisses whose joy is dead. \n\nThere are flowers without a hue,\nLilies that under the moonlight fade, \nMoonlight over the meadows laid, \nFountains far on the sky-line blue. \n\nWeary and heavy with slumber I\nSee thro' the lids that slumber closes \nCrows that gather amid the roses, \nSick folk under a sunbright sky.\n\nOf these vague loves the weary smart \nShines unchanging, late and soon, \nLike a pale slow-moving moon\nSadly into my indolent heart."}
