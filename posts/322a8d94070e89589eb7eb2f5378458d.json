{"subject": "Ode To Dubh-Ghiolla, The Shield Of Aodh", "text": "Bright as the speckled salmon of the wave! \nDubh-Ghiola ! panic of the branded brave; \nWith thee would I combine, in deathless praise, \nProud Aodh, whose arm of might thy burden sways. \nFenced with its thorny mail the holly stands\u2014 \nSo, round the prince the guardian shield expands : \nThe bull's strong hide the needle's point defies\u2014 \nThus vainly round him baffled ranks arise: \nThat shield at once his panoply and blade, \nHe scorns the spear, the falchion's feebler aid. \nAs chafing storms, too long in durance pent, \nSweep through the forest, finding sudden vent; \nSuch is the voice of Aodh when, with his shield, \nCompassed he stands, bright terror of the field!"}
