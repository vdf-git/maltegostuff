{"subject": "Old Sir John", "text": "Bald, with old eyes a blood-shot blue, he comes\nInto the Boar's-Head Inn: the hot sweat streaks\nHis fulvous face, and all his raiment reeks\nOf all the stews and all the Eastcheap slums.\nUpon the battered board again he drums\nAnd croaks for sack: then sits, his harsh haired cheeks\nSunk in his hands rough with the grime of weeks,\nWhile 'round the tap one great bluebottle hums.\nAll, all are gone, the old companions they\nWho made his rogue's world merry: of them all\nNot one is left. Old, toothless now, and gray\nAlone he waits: the swagger of that day\nGone from his bulk departed even as Doll,\nAnd he, his Hal, who broke his heart, they say."}
