{"subject": "St. George", "text": "The dragon to his cave retires,\nAnd all the world awaits the kill:\nBut we can feel the angry fires,\nAnd hear the captives crying still.\n\nBy bench and bomb, machine and mine,\nIn all the fleets that feed the fray,\nOn all the roads across the Rhine,\nRide in our hearts, Saint George, to-day.\nApril 23, 1944"}
