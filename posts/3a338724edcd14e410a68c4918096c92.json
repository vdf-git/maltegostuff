{"subject": "The Common Man", "text": "When plastered billboards scream with slogans \n'fight for your country, go to battle' \nWhen media's print assults your senses, \n'Support our leaders' shrieks and rattles... \nAnd fools who don't know any better \nBelieve the old, eternal lie \nThat we must march and shoot and kill \nMurder, and burn, and bomb, and grill... \n\nWhen press begins the battle-cry \nThat nation needs to unify \nAnd for your country you must die... \nDear brainwashed friend, my neighbor dear \nBrother from this, or other nation \nKnow that the cries of anger, fear, \nAre nothing but manipulation \nby fat-cats, kings who covet riches, \nAnd feed off your sweat and blood - the leeches! \nWhen call to arms engulfs the land \nIt means that somewhere oil was found, \nShooting 'blackgold' from underground! \nIt means they found a sneaky way \nTo make more money, grab more gold \nBut this is not what you are told! \n\nDon't spill your blood for bucks or oil \nBreak, burn your rifle, shout: 'NO DEAL!' \nLet the rich scoundrels, kings, and bankers \nSend their own children to get killed! \nMay your loud voice be amplified \nBy roar of other common men \nThe battle-weary of all nations: \nWE WON'T BE CONNED TO WAR AGAIN!"}
