{"subject": "In Plain Sight", "text": "You were bound by bars made of steel.\n That held your body rigid in its case.\n Or perhaps your chair had a set of iron wheels.\n Keeping you physically in place.\n We saw these things my friends and I.\n The nuts and bolts of it we thought.\n Oh! But we missed the life in your eyes.\n The joy of what you could do brought.\n Each task harder than one before yet you'd try.\n The things that we took for granted.\n That you could never easily do.\n Yet the will to succeed was well planted.\n For the simple things like trying shoes.\n Was never a great achievement.\n To us for whom it came easily.\n Of all life skills one fact is true.\n One thing I know is a plus.\n I believed we were training you.\n Instead you were teaching us.\n That societies views were wrong.\n For in the past you were hidden awayt.\n Out in plain sight is where you belong.\n Leading us on this new path is where you'll stay."}
