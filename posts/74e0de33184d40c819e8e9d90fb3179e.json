Take killjoy's\ncameras &amp; microphones to the streets.\n\nIf you're holding the hand lightning strikes\njuice will light you up miles from the streets\n\nwhere an electric chair surge dims\nall the county lights beyond the streets.\n\nWho will go out there &amp; speak laws\nof motion &amp; relativity in the streets?\n\nYusef, this morning proves a crow\nthe only truth serum in the street."}
