{"subject": "The Last Lie", "text": "Some guy in the miserable convoy\nRaised up in the back of our open truck\nAnd threw a can of c-rations at a child\nWho called into the rumble for food.\nHe didn't toss the can, he wound up and hung it\nOn the child's forehead and she was stunned\nBackwards into the dust of our trucks.\n\nAcross the sudden angle of the road's curving\nI could still see her when she rose\nWaving one hand across her swollen, bleeding head,\nWildly swinging her other hand\nAt the children who mobbed her,\nWho tried to take her food.\n\nI grit my teeth to myself to remember that girl\nSmiling as she fought off her brothers and sisters.\nShe laughed\nAs if she thought it were a joke\nAnd the guy with me laughed\nAnd fingered the edge of another can\nLike it was the seam of a baseball\nUnfit his rage ripped\nAgain into the faces of children\nWho called to us for food."}
