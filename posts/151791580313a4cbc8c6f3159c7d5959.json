{"subject": "Poetry", "text": "In the same way that the mindless diamond keeps\none spark of the planet's early fires\ntrapped forever in its net of ice,\nit's not love's later heat that poetry holds,\nbut the atom of the love that drew it forth\nfrom the silence: so if the bright coal of his love\nbegins to smoulder, the poet hears his voice\nsuddenly forced, like a bar-room singer's -- boastful\nwith his own huge feeling, or drowned by violins;\nbut if it yields a steadier light, he knows\nthe pure verse, when it finally comes, will sound\nlike a mountain spring, anonymous and serene.\n\nBeneath the blue oblivious sky, the water\nsings of nothing, not your name, not mine."}
