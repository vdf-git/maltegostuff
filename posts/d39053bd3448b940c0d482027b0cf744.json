{"subject": "Epitaph On A Friend", "text": "By painful sickness long severely prest,\nHere sinks, on Nature's sacred lap of rest,\nA friend, who, in a life too short, display'd\nA mind in virtue bright, without one shade.\nHence with unusual grief is Fondness mov'd,\nHence more than Pity's sighs for one belov'd;\nUnshaken Honour sheds a manly tear,\nAnd weeping Virtue stops, a mourner here."}
