{"subject": "Moving To The Promise Land", "text": "When we moo about in search of grass, \nWe consume little greens and fail to defecate\nOn the terrestrial for a replacement \nOur breast below leak\nAs we waste our precious milk\n\nOur head has in many times failed\nTo lead we the legs to the promise field\nOur horns has not been so strong\nStrong enough to scare away our evil strangers\nOur tails has never been effective to scare away our foe, insect\n\nOur light has stop being our sight\nRather, being our foe in darkness\nOur ears a times controls our eyes\nBut our head still fail to locate the promise land\nLike the chameleon faeces, our affairs has been so cumbersome\n\nOther cows are fat\nBut as for us, we are skinny and light\nOur milk attracts our stranger-friends\nBut we fail to let them know their stand\nThe mouth on our head is only interested in bread\nAnd fail to moo for the truth\n\nOur teeth\nOnly knows how to chew\nBut does not have a canine to bite\nOh! We have been infected\nBy these dreadful tsetse flies\nNow we don't know more or less than to sleep\n\nSurely, Someday, \nWe will be in MAY\nAnd our head shall bare an ache\nThen we shall be set for a true search of the place\nI mean the promise field\nAll these without our head\nAnd our breast shall leak no more"}
