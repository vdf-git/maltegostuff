{"subject": "Labor and Capital", "text": "The softness of this motel bed\nOn which we made love\nDemonstrates to me in an impressive manner\nThe superiority of capitalism.\n\nAt the mattress factory, I imagine,\nThe employees are happy today.\nIt's Sunday and they are working\nExtra hours, like us, for no pay.\n\nStill, the way you open your legs\nAnd reach for me with your hand\nMakes me think of the Revolution,\nRed banners, crowd charging.\n\nSomeone stepping on a soapbox\nAs the flames engulf the palace,\nAnd the old prince in full view\nSteps to his death from a balcony."}
