{"subject": "Passing", "text": "To spring, to bloom, to fade,\nThis is the sum of the laborious years ;\nLife preludes death as laughter ends in tears :\nAll things that God has made\nSuffer perpetual change, and may not long endure.\n\nWe alter day by day ;\nEach little moment, as life's current rolls,\nStamps some faint impress on our yielding souls ;\nWe may not rest nor stay,\nDrifting on tides unseen to one dread goal and sure.\n\nOur being is compassed round\nWith miracles ; on this our life-long sleep,\nStrange whispers rise from the surrounding deep,\nLike that weird ocean sound\nBorne in still summer nights on weary watching ears.\n\nThe selves we leave behind\nAffright us like the ghosts of friends long dead ;\nThe old love vanished in the present dread,\nThey visit us to find\nNew sorrows, alien hopes, strange pleasures, other fears."}
