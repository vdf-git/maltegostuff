{"subject": "A Plough And A Spade", "text": "A plough and a spade, that's all. \nA row of chrysanthemums, and orchids, \nA place to plant beans: That's all I need. \nFriends come, birds sing, and flowers wave: Welcome! \nThe moon walks with me when I fetch water for tea. \nOld Po Yi stayed pure and stayed happy, \nYen-tzu stayed poor and liked it. \nLet the world buzz, \nI need no praise, I am deaf to laughter."}
