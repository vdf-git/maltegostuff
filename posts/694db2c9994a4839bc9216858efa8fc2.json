{"subject": "Love", "text": "In the soul is born a feeling,\nOr a sentiment, called love,\nWhich is nursed, caressed and cherished\nWith care, tender, from Above.\nBy the law of God, who made us,\nBy the guidance of its like,\nIt selects a life companion\nFrom where'er its fancies strike.\nOften does it make an error;\nOft is deceived in its find;\nOft is scorned and turned back coldly:\nOft brings sadness to the mind.\nBy the law of man 'tis given\nAs a trust, with cupid's seal,\nTo be nurtured, fondly cared for:\nThus becomes life's woe or weal.\nBy the law of changeful nature,\nIt is made to ill agree;\nIn its haste has oft been blinded\nBy some false identity.\nOn its whims have hung great fortunes,\nOr the fates of great careers.\nBy the sting of its rejection,\nLives have been engulfed in tears.\nHearts have yearned for its fond presence\nE'en grim Death has stayed his stroke\nTo permit this magic power\nTo repair a heart, once broke.\nFor love's sake have lives been ended:\nFrom its joy has sorrow fled:\nTo its care is honor trusted.\nSouls bereft of love are dead."}
