{"subject": "Our Bodies Break Light", "text": "We crawl through the tall grass and idle light,\n\nour chests against the earth so we can hear the river\nunderground. Our backs carry rotting wood and books\n\nthat hold no stories of damnation or miracles.\nOne day as we listen for water, we find a beekeeper\u2014\n\none eye pearled by a cataract, the other cut out by his own hand\nso he might know both types of blindness. When we stand\n\nin front of him, he says we are prisms breaking light into color\u2014\nour right shoulders red, our left hips a wavering indigo.\n\nHis apiaries are empty except for dead queens, and he sits\non his quiet boxes humming as he licks honey from the bodies\n\nof drones. He tells me he smelled my southern skin for miles,\nsays the graveyard is full of dead prophets. To you, he presents\n\nhis arms, tattooed with songs slave catchers whistle\nas they unleash the dogs. He lets you see the burns on his chest\n\nfrom the time he set fire to boats and pushed them out to sea.\nYou ask why no one believes in madness anymore,\n\nand he tells you stars need a darkness to see themselves by.\nWhen you ask about resurrection, he says, How can you doubt?\n\nand shows you a deer licking salt from a lynched man's palm."}
