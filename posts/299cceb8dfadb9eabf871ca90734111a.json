{"subject": "True Friendship", "text": "Friendship, thou balm for ev'ry ill, \nI must aspire to thee; \nWhose breezes bid the heart be still, \nAnd render sweet the patient's pill, \nAnd set the pris'ner free. \n\nFriendship, it is the softest soul \nWhich feels another's pain; \nAnd must with equal sighs condole, \nWhile sympathetic streamlets roll, \nWhich nothing can restrain. \n\nNot to be nominated smart, \nOf mortals to be seen, \nShe does not thus her gifts impart, \nHer aid is from a feeling heart, \nA principle within. \n\nWhen the lone stranger, forced to roam, \nComes shiv'ring to her door, \nAt once he finds a welcome home, \nThe torch of grace dispels his gloom, \nAnd bids him grope no more. \n\nFriendship was never known to fail \nThe voice of need to hear, \nWhen ruthless ills our peace assail, \nWhen from our hearts she draws the veil, \nAnd drys the falling tear. \n\nWhen dogs and devils snarl and fight, \nShe hides and dwells alone; \nWhen friends and kindred disunite, \nWith pity she surveys the right, \nAnd gives to each his own. \n\nFriendship has not a sister grace \nHer wonders to exceed; \nShe is the queen of all her race, \nWhose charms the stoutest must embrace \nWhen in the vale of need. \n\nFriendship is but the feeling sigh, \nThe sympathizing tear, \nConstrain'd to flow till others dry, \nNor lets the needy soul pass by, \nNor scorns to see or hear."}
