{"subject": "Wife's Disaster Manual", "text": "When the forsaken city starts to burn,\nafter the men and children have fled,\nstand still, silent as prey, and slowly turn\n\nback. Behold the curse. Stay and mourn\nthe collapsing doorways, the unbroken bread\nin the forsaken city starting to burn.\n\nDon't flinch. Don't join in.\nResist the righteous scurry and instead\nstand still, silent as prey. Slowly turn\n\nyour thoughts away from escape: the iron\ngates unlatched, the responsibilities shed.\nWhen the forsaken city starts to burn,\n\nsurrender to your calling, show concern\nfor those who remain. Come to a dead\nstandstill. Silent as prey, slowly turn\n\ninto something essential. Learn\nthe names of the fallen. Refuse to run ahead\nwhen the forsaken city starts to burn.\nStand still and silent. Pray. Return."}
