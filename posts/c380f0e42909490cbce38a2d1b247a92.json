{"subject": "Why, Mommy, Why?", "text": "Why, Mommy, why must you do this? I\u2019ve barely just begun. I\u2019ll\n never be allowed to have any fun. The world is full of colors\n which I may never see. The world is full of food my tummy wants\n to try. Why, Mommy, why? Plenty of food I want to taste. Why\n put me to waste. The crime is bad. This I know. I promise I\u2019ll\n be one you will be proud to show. Why do I have to go? I\u2019m here\n for a reason yet unknown, but will that reason forever be blown?\n Seasons come, seasons go. Are they pretty? Will I ever know? I\n continue to grow as each day goes by. I continue to pray but yet\n I ask, \u201cWhy, Mommy, Why?\u201d"}
