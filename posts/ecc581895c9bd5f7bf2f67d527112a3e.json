{"subject": "The Electric Tram To Kew", "text": "Through the swift night \nI go to my love. \nTram bells are joy bells, \nBidding us move \nOn a golden path \nBeneath balls of fire \nUp hill and down dale, \nTo o'ertake desire. \nPast the old shops \nThat my childhood knew, \nPast hidden houses \nAnd fields of dew \nLovely and secret \nAs thou, my friend, \nWho art all heaven \nAt journey's end."}
