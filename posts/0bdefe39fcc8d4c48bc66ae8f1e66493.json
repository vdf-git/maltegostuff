{"subject": "The Death Of Agnes", "text": "Now that the sunlight dies in my eyes,\nAnd the moonlight grows in my hair,\nI who was never very wise,\nNever was very fair,\nVirgin and martyr all my life,\nWhat has life left to give\nMe--who was never mother nor wife,\nNever got leave to live?\n\nNothing of life could I clasp or claim,\nNothing could steal or save.\nSo when you come to carve my name,\nGive me life in my grave.\nTo keep me warm when I sleep alone\nA lie is little to give;\nCall me 'Magdalen' on my stone,\nThough I died and did not live."}
