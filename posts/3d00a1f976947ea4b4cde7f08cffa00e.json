{"subject": "The Sitting", "text": "My half-sister comes to me to be painted:\nShe is posing furtively, like a letter being\nPushed under a door, making a tunnel with her\nHands over her dull-rose dress. Yet her coppery\nHead is as bright as a net of lemons, I am\nPainting it hair by hair as if she had not\nDisowned it, of forsaken those unsparkling\nEyes as blue may be sifted from the surface\nOf a cloud; and she questions my brisk\nBrushwork, the note of positive red\nIn the kissed mouth I have given her\nAs a woman's touch makes curtains blossom\nPermanently in a house: she calls it\nWishfulness, the failure of the tampering rain\nTo go right into the mountain, she prefers\nMy sea-studies, and will not sit for me\nAgain, something half-opened, rarer\nThan railroads, a soiled red-letter day."}
