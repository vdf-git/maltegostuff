{"subject": "Will You Love Me Forever", "text": "Will you love me forever, I really must know?\n Or will you love me awhile, then let me go.\n\n Love is patience, gentle so to speak.\n Love should be strong in every thing never weak.\n\n Will you love me forever is always on my mind.\n There is a difference in love, and just being kind.\n\n Will you hold my hand when I am old and gray.\n And say I will love you forever as I fade away."}
