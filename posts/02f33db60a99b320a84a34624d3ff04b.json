{"subject": "Grassholm", "text": "the magic of one of the world's largest gannet colonies, close up. \nPembrokeshire Boat Charters\n\nWhen the gannets turned her flesh \ninto a gannet, all the light blew in \nat once. It sucked her skyward, shrieking. \n\nHe squinted from the stunned deck.\nShe was wheeling like a sycamore-\nkey. He had witnessed childbirth, \n\nand the indivisibility of pain, here, \ntoo, was hurtful. Her mother's name\nwas what she cried out last. But chaos\n\nmends. Then there she was, all china-curve \nand braced wing, and a beak he thought\nunusually expressive. He ran cold fingers \n\ndown her spine and knew the bones. Thrilled\nwith the common speech of touch, they spoke\nin elemental terms that he would later publish\n\nto acclaim. He passes seasons by himself \nand reads the Mabinogion and Ovid. Calm \nsurprises him. He comes home from long visits \n\nin the summer months with eyes like rock-pools. \nShe'll have given him Sistines of seabirds, \nplummeting parabolas of love. And he'll \n\nhave oiled and preened her feathers and her \nblue feet - though it makes him faint, to feel \nthe quickfire of her heart and breathe the ocean \n\nof her. Change like that must ruin ordinary \nfolk. These two far from ordinary, neither\nknows who gained the greater freedom by it."}
