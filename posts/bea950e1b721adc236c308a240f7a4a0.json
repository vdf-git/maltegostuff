{"subject": "The Hunter And His Dying Steed", "text": "\u201cWo worth the chase. Wo worth the day,\nThat cost thy life, my gallant grey!\u201d\u2014Scott \n\nThe Hunter stooped o\u2019er his dying steed\nWith sad dejected mien,\nAnd softly stroked its glossy neck,\nLustrous as silken sheen;\nWith iron will and nerve of steel,\nAnd pale lips tight compressed,\nHe kept the tears from eyes that long\nWere strange to such a guest. \n\nThou\u2019rt dying now, my faithful one,\nAlas! \u2019tis easy known\u2014\nThy neck would arch beneath my touch,\nThou\u2019dst brighten at my tone;\nBut turn not thus thy restless eyes\nUpon my saddened brow,\nNor look with such imploring gaze\u2014\nI cannot help thee now. \n\nNo more we\u2019ll bound o\u2019er dew gemmed sward\nAt break of summer morn,\nOr follow on, through forests green,\nThe hunter\u2019s merry horn;\nNo more we\u2019ll brave the rapid stream,\nNor battle with the tide,\nNor cross the slipp\u2019ry mountain path,\nAs we were wont to ride. \n\nOh! we have travelled many miles,\nAnd dangers have we braved;\nAnd more than once thy matchless speed\nThy master\u2019s life hath saved;\nAnd many nights the forest sward\nHas been the couch we\u2019ve pressed,\nWhere, pillowed on thy glossy neck,\nMost sweet has been my rest. \n\nHow often, too, I we shared with thee\nThe hunter\u2019s scanty fare.\nTo see thee suffer want or pain,\nMute friend I could not bear;\nAnd now, thou best in agony,\nAs if thy heart would burst,\nAnd I, what can I do for thee,\nSave slake thy burning thirst? \n\nThat parting sob, that failing glance\u2014\nThe pains of death are past!\nThy glazing eyes still turned on me\nWith love unto the last!\nWell may my tears o\u2019er thy cold form,\nMy steed, flow fast and free,\nFor, oh! I have had many friends,\nYet none so true as thee!"}
