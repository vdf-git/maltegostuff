{"subject": "Youth", "text": "She paved the way with perfume sweet\nOf flowers that moved like winds alight,\nAnd never weary grew my feet\nWandering through[the spring's delight.\n\nShe dropped her sweet fife to her lips\nAnd lured me with her melodies,\nTo where the great big wandering ships\nPut out into the peaceful seas.\nBut when the year grew chill and brown,\nAnd all the wings of Summer flown,\nWithin the tumult of a town\nShe left me to grow old alone."}
