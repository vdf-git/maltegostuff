{"subject": "Lxx. The Character Of A True Philosopher", "text": "The hopes and fears of a plebeian's mind\nTo outward objects only are confin'd;\nRiches and pleasures are his chief delight,\nThe prizes which engage his appetite:\nThese he thinks make him fortunate, if won,\nAnd if he fail, he's ruin'd and undone;\nNor has the sordid, thoughtless thing, a sense\nOf a more noble inward excellence.\nBut the philosopher's exalted soul\nNo little outward trifles can controul;\nNo promis'd joy, nor fear his mind affects,\nHis good and ill he from himself expects;\nSecure within himself, he can despise\nThe gaieties that charm the vulgar's eyes,\nAnd accidents, which weaker minds surprise."}
