{"subject": "A Morning Sail", "text": "What art thou, say, a bird, or beast, or what?\nLeering from that old plane-tree's hollow stem!\nThine eyes have something criminal in them,\nAnd thy hooked beak suggests a chilling thought\nOf midnight murder of sweet sleeping things,\nDreaming with delicate heads beneath their wings,\nAnd of thy hideous presence knowing not,\nTill thou dost swoop!\u2026 I scarce can look at thee\nWithout a shudder, thinking how of old,\nIn frightful dungeons far beyond the sea,\nThe heathen kings their prisoners would hold\nFor devilish wreaking of their cruelty,\nAnd, while the beasts lapped human blood as wine,\nLaughed in a husky, heartless voice, like thine!"}
