{"subject": "By The Annisquam", "text": "A Far bell tinkles in the hollow,\nAnd heart and soul are fain to follow:\nGone is the rose and gone the swallow:\nAutumn is here.\n\nThe wild geese draw at dusk their harrow\nAbove the 'Squam the ebb leaves narrow:\nThe sea-winds chill you to the marrow:\nSad goes the year.\n\nAmong the woods the crows are calling:\nThe acorns and the leaves are falling:\nAt sea the fishing-boats are trawling:\nAutumn is here.\n\nThe jay among the rocks is screaming,\nAnd every way with crimson streaming:\nFar up the shore the foam is creaming:\nSleep fills the Year.\n\nThe chipmunk on the stones is barking;\nThe red leaf every path is marking,\nWhere hills lean to the ocean harking:\nAutumn is here.\n\nThe fields are starry with the aster,\nWhere Beauty dreams and dim Disaster\nDraws near through mists that gather faster:\nFarewell, sweet Year.\n\nBeside the coves driftwood is burning,\nAnd far at sea white sails are turning:\nEach day seems filled with deeper yearning:\nAutumn is here.\n\n'Good-bye! good-bye!' the Summer's saying:\n'Brief was my day as songs of Maying:\nThe time is come for psalms and praying:\nGood-bye, sweet Year.'\n\nBrown bend the ferns by rock and boulder;\nThe shore seems greyer; ocean older:\nThe days are misty; nights are colder:\nAutumn is here.\n\nThe cricket in the grass is crying,\nAnd sad winds in the old woods sighing;\nThey seem to say, 'Sweet Summer's dying:\nWeep for the Year.\n\n'She's wreathed her hair with bay and berry,\nAnd o'er dark pools, the wild-fowl ferry,\nLeans dreaming 'neath the wilding cherry:\nAutumn is here.\n\n'Good-bye! good-bye to Summer's gladness:\nTo all her beauty, mirth and madness:\nCome sit with us and dream in sadness:\nSo ends the Year.'"}
