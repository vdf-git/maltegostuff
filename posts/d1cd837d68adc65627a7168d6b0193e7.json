{"subject": "The Soul That Loves God Finds Him Everywhere", "text": "O thou, by long experience tried,\nNear whom no grief can long abide;\nMy love! how full of sweet content\nI pass my years of banishment!\n\nAll scenes alike engaging prove\nTo souls impressed with sacred love\nWhere'er they dwell, they dwell in thee;\nIn heaven, in earth, or on the sea.\n\nTo me remains nor place nor time;\nMy country is in every clime;\nI can be calm and free from care\nOn any shore, since God is there.\n\nWhile place we seek, or place we shun,\nThe soul finds happiness in none;\nBut, with a God to guide our way,\n'Tis equal joy to go or stay.\n\nCould I be cast where thou art not,\nThat were indeed a dreadful lot;\nBut regions none remote I call,\nSecure of finding God in all.\n\nMy country, Lord, art thou alone;\nNor other can I claim or own;\nThe point where all my wishes meet;\nMy law, my love, life's only sweet!\n\nI hold by nothing here below;\nAppoint my journey and I go;\nThough pierced by scorn, oppressed by pride,\nI feel thee good--feel nought beside.\n\nNo frowns of men can hurtful prove\nTo souls on fire with heavenly love;\nThough men and devils both condemn,\nNo gloomy days arise from them.\n\nAh, then! to his embrace repair;\nMy soul, thou art no stranger there;\nThere love divine shall be thy guard,\nAnd peace and safety thy reward."}
