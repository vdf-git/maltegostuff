{"subject": "Desert Night", "text": "A desert moon is shining\n on a road that's dim and quiet;\n Where I fain would sit and ponder,\n through the stillness of the night.\n On a stately little hillock\n is a pile of gleaming sand;\n it lies in peaceful solitude\n and does not hint of man.\n Where I can sit and watch the birthing\n of a new day, fresh and bright;\n as with its infant fingers it\n rolls back the shades of night.\n I dream my dreams of yesteryear\n and things that might have been;\n and words that ne'er were spoken\n and places I have seen.\n Life is a desert day.\n It breaks in bright crescendo.\n It climbs in warmth, declines in peace,\n and ends in velvet splendor."}
