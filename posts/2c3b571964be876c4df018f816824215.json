{"subject": "West London", "text": "Crouch'd on the pavement close by Belgrave Square\nA tramp I saw, ill, moody, and tongue-tied;\nA babe was in her arms, and at her side\nA girl; their clothes were rags, their feet were bare.\nSome labouring men, whose work lay somewhere there,\nPass'd opposite; she touch'd her girl, who hied\nAcross, and begg'd and came back satisfied.\nThe rich she had let pass with frozen stare.\nThought I: Above her state this spirit towers;\nShe will not ask of aliens, but of friends,\nOf sharers in a common human fate.\nShe turns from that cold succour, which attneds\nThe unknown little from the unknowing great,\nAnd points us to a better time than ours."}
