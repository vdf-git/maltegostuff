{"subject": "At April", "text": "Toss your gay heads,\nBrown girl trees;\nToss your gay lovely heads;\nShake your brown slim bodies;\nStretch your brown slim arms;\nStretch your brown slim toes.\nWho knows better than we,\nWith the dark, dark bodies,\nWhat it means\nWhen April comes a-laughing and a-weeping \nOnce again\nAt our hearts?"}
