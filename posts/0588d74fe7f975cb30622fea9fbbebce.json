{"subject": "Come Unto Me", "text": "Oh, for the time gone by, when thought of Christ\nMade His Yoke easy and His Burden light;\nWhen my heart stirred within me at the sight\nOf Altar spread for awful Eucharist;\nWhen all my hopes His promises sufficed,\nWhen my Soul watched for Him by day, by night,\nWhen my lamp lightened and my robe was white,\nAnd all seemed loss, except the Pearl unpriced.\nYet, since He calls me still with tender Call,\nSince He remembers Whom I half forgot,\nI even will run my race and bear my lot:\nFor Faith the walls of Jericho cast down,\nAnd Hope to whoso runs holds forth a Crown,\nAnd Love is Christ, and Christ is All in all."}
