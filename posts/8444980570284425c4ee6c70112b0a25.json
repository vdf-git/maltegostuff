{"subject": "Petrified", "text": "your heart's tongue seized\nmid-syllable, caught by the lava flow\nyou fled. Fixed,\nyou stiffen in the arms of wonder's dark\nundomesticated sister. Can't you name her\nand escape? You are the statue\nthat has lost the entrance into art,\nwild and incompetent,\nyou have no house. Who are you?\nYou are the crystal that picks up\nits many deaths.\nYou are the momentary mind of rock."}
