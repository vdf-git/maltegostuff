{"subject": "What Must Be Said", "text": "Why did I remain silent, silent so long,\nabout something so clear we used\nin war games, where, as survivors,\nwe are just the footnotes? \n\nThat is the claimed right to the formal preventive aggression\nwhich could erase the Iranian people\ndominated by a bouncer and moved to an organized jubilation,\nbecause in the area of his competence there is\nthe construction of the atomic bomb.\n\nAnd then why do I avoid myself\nto call the other country with its name,\nwhere since years - even if secretly covered -\nthere is an increasing nuclear power,\nwithout control, because unreachable\nby every inspection? \n\nI feel the everybody silence on this state of affairs,\nwhich my silence is slave to,\nas an oppressive lie and an inhibition that presents punishment\nwe don't pay attention to; \nthe verdict 'anti-Semitism' is common.\n\nNow, since my country,\nfrom time to time touched by unique and exclusive crimes,\nobliged to justify itself,\nagain for pure business aims - even if\nwith fast tongue we call it 'reparation' -\nshould deliver another submarine to Israel,\nwith the specialty of addressing\nannihilating warheads where the\nexistence of one atomic bomb is not proved\nbut it wants evidence as a scarecrow,\nI say what must be said.\n\nWhy did I stay silent until now? \nBecause the thought about my origin,\nburdened by an unclearing stain,\nhad avoiding to wait this fact\nlike a truth declared by the State of Israel\nthat I want to be connected to.\n\nWhy did I say it only now,\nold and with the last ink:\nthe nuclear power of Israel\nthreat the world peace? \nBecause it must be said\nwhat tomorrow will be too late; \nBecause - as Germans and with\nenough faults on the back -\nwe might also become deliverers of a predictable\ncrime, and no excuse would erase our complicity.\n\nAnd I admit: I won't be silent\nbecause I had enough of the Western hypocrisy; \nBecause I wish that many will want\nto get rid of the silence,\nexhorting the cause of a recognizable\nrisk to the abdication, asking that a free and permanent control\nof the Israel atomic power\nand the Iran nuclear bases\nwill be made by both the governments\nwith an international supervision.\n\nOnly in this way, Israelis, Palestinians, and everybody,\nall people living hostile face to face in that\ncountry occupied by the craziness,\nwill have a way out,\nso us too."}
