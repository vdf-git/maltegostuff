{"subject": "A Receipt For Happiness", "text": "BEGIN the day with smiling eyes ; \nPursue the day with smiling lips; \nThrough clouds perceive the smiling skies \nUp where the smiling sunbeam trips. \n\nLet smiling thoughts within your mind \nDrive gloom and cold despair apart,\nAnd promptings of a genial kind \nKeep ever growing in your heart. \n\nMeet trouble with a cheery mien,\nBe jovial in the face of care \nHe routs all mischief from the scene \nWho greets it with a jocund air."}
