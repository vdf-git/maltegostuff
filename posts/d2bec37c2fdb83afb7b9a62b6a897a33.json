{"subject": "Ask What I Shall Give Thee (Iii)", "text": "Behold the throne of grace!\nThe promise calls me near;\nThere Jesus shows a smiling face,\nAnd waits to answer prayer. \n\nThat rich atoning blood,\nWhich sprinkled round I see;\nProvides for those who come to God,\nAn all-prevailing plea. \n\nMy soul ask what thou wilt,\nThou canst not be too bold;\nSince his own blood for thee he spilt,\nWhat else can he withhold. \n\nBeyond thy utmost wants\nHis love and pow'r can bless;\nTo praying souls he always grants,\nMore than they can express. \n\nSince 'tis the Lord's command,\nMy mouth I open wide;\nLord open thou thy bounteous hand,\nThat I may be supplied. \n\nThine image, Lord, bestow,\nThy presence and thy love;\nI ask to serve thee here below,\nAnd reign with thee above. \n\nTeach me to live by faith,\nConform my will to thine;\nLet me victorious be in death,\nAnd then in glory shine. \n\nIf Thou these blessings give,\nAnd wilt my portion be;\nCheerful the world's poor toys I leave,\nTo them who know not thee."}
