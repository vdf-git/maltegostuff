{"subject": "Sixteen Dead Men", "text": "Hark! in the still night. Who goes there ?\n\u201cFifteen dead men' Why do they wait ?\n\u201cHasten, comrade, death is so fair'\nNow comes their Captain through the dim gate.\n\nSixteen dead men! What on their sword ?\n\u201cA nation's honour proud do they bear.'\nWhat on their bent heads ? ' God's holy word ;\nAll of their nation's heart blended in prayer'\n\nSixteen dead men! What makes their shroud ?\n\u201cAll of their nations love wraps them around'\nWhere do their bodies lie, brave and so proud ?\n\u201cUnder the gallows-tree in prison ground.'\n\nSixteen dead men! Where do they go ?\n\u201cTo join their regiment, where Sarsfield leads ;\nWolfe Tone and Emmet, too, well do they know.\nThere shall they bivouac, telling great deeds.'\n\nSixteen dead men! Shall they return ?\n\u201cTea, they shall come again, breath of our breath.\nThey on our nation's hearth made old fires burn.\nGuard her unconquered soul, strong in their death.'"}
