{"subject": "The Philanderer", "text": "Oh, have you forgotten those afternoons\nWith riot of roses and amber skies,\nWhen we thrilled to the joy of a million Junes,\nAnd I sought for your soul in the deeps of your eyes?\nI would love you, I promised, forever and aye,\nAnd I meant it too; yet, oh, isn't it odd?\nWhen we met in the Underground to-day\nI addressed you as Mary instead of as Maude.\n\nOh, don't you remember that moonlit sea,\nWith us on a silver trail afloat,\nWhen I gracefully sank on my bended knee\nAt the risk of upsetting our little boat?\nOh, I vowed that my life was blighted then,\nAs friendship you proffered with mournful mien;\nBut now as I think of your children ten,\nI'm glad you refused me, Evangeline.\n\nOh, is that moment eternal still\nWhen I breathed my love in your shell-like ear,\nAnd you plucked at your fan as a maiden will,\nAnd you blushed so charmingly, Guenivere?\nLike a worshiper at your feet I sat;\nFor a year and a day you made me mad;\nBut now, alas! you are forty, fat,\nAnd I think: What a lucky escape I had!\n\nOh, maidens I've set in a sacred shrine,\nOh, Rosamond, Molly and Mignonette,\nI've deemed you in turn the most divine,\nIn turn you've broken my heart . . . and yet\nIt's easily mended. What's past is past.\nTo-day on Lucy I'm going to call;\nFor I'm sure that I know true love at last,\nAnd She is the fairest girl of all."}
