{"subject": "Ode On The Istallation Of The Duke Of Devonshire", "text": "Hence a while, severer Muses;\nSpare your slaves till drear October.\nHence; for Alma Mater chooses\nNot to be for ever sober:\nBut, like stately matron gray,\nCalling child and grandchild round her,\nWill for them at least be gay;\nShare for once their holiday;\nAnd, knowing she will sleep the sounder,\nCheerier-hearted on the morrow\nRise to grapple care and sorrow,\nGrandly leads the dance adown, and joins the children's play.\nSo go, for in your places\nAlready, as you see,\n(Her tears for some deep sorrow scarcely dried),\nVenus holds court among her sinless graces,\nWith many a nymph from many a park and lea.\nShe, pensive, waits the merrier faces\nOf those your wittier sisters three,\nO'er jest and dance and song who still preside,\nTo cheer her in this merry-mournful tide;\nAnd bids us, as she smiles or sighs,\nTune our fancies by her eyes.\n\nThen let the young be glad,\nFair girl and gallant lad,\nAnd sun themselves to-day\nBy lawn and garden gay;\n'Tis play befits the noon\nOf rosy-girdled June:\nWho dare frown if heaven shall smile?\nBlest, who can forget a while;\nThe world before them, and above\nThe light of universal love.\nGo, then, let the young be gay;\nFrom their heart as from their dress\nLet darkness and let mourning pass away,\nWhile we the staid and worn look on and bless.\n\nHealth to courage firm and high!\nHealth to Granta's chivalry!\nWisely finding, day by day,\nPlay in toil, and toil in play.\nGranta greets them, gliding down\nOn by park and spire and town;\nHumming mills and golden meadows,\nBarred with elm and poplar shadows;\nGiant groves, and learned halls;\nHoly fanes and pictured walls.\nYet she bides not here; around\nLies the Muses' sacred ground.\nMost she lingers, where below\nGliding wherries come and go;\nStalwart footsteps shake the shores;\nRolls the pulse of stalwart oars;\nRings aloft the exultant cry\nFor the bloodless victory.\nThere she greets the sports, which breed\nValiant lads for England's need;\nWisely finding, day by day,\nPlay in toil, and toil in play.\nHealth to courage, firm and high!\nHealth to Granta's chivalry!\n\nYet stay a while, severer Muses, stay,\nFor you, too, have your rightful parts to-day.\nKnown long to you, and known through you to fame,\nAre Chatsworth's halls, and Cavendish's name.\nYou too, then, Alma Mater calls to greet\nA worthy patron for your ancient seat;\nAnd bid her sons from him example take,\nOf learning purely sought for learning's sake,\nOf worth unboastful, power in duty spent;\nAnd see, fulfilled in him, her high intent.\n\nCome, Euterpe, wake thy choir;\nFit thy notes to our desire.\nLong may he sit the chiefest here,\nMeet us and greet us, year by year;\nLong inherit, sire and son,\nAll that their race has wrought and won,\nSince that great Cavendish came again,\nRound the world and over the main,\nBreasting the Thames with his mariners bold,\nPast good Queen Bess's palace of old;\nWith jewel and ingot packed in his hold,\nAnd sails of damask and cloth of gold;\nWhile never a sailor-boy on board\nBut was decked as brave as a Spanish lord,\nWith the spoils he had won\nIn the Isles of the Sun,\nAnd the shores of Fairy-land,\nAnd yet held for the crown of the goodly show,\nThat queenly smile from the Palace window,\nAnd that wave of a queenly hand.\nYes, let the young be gay,\nAnd sun themselves to-day;-\nAnd from their hearts, as from their dress,\nLet mourning pass away.\nBut not from us, who watch our years fast fleeing,\nAnd snatching as they flee, fresh fragments of our being.\nCan we forget one friend,\nCan we forget one face,\nWhich cheered us toward our end,\nWhich nerved us for our race?\nOh sad to toil, and yet forego\nOne presence which has made us know\nTo Godlike souls how deep our debt!\nWe would not, if we could, forget.\n\nSeverer Muses, linger yet;\nSpeak out for us one pure and rich regret.\nThou, Clio, who, with awful pen,\nGravest great names upon the hearts of men,\nSpeak of a fate beyond our ken;\nA gem late found and lost too soon; {306}\nA sun gone down at highest noon;\nA tree from Odin's ancient root,\nWhich bore for men the ancient fruit,\nCounsel, and faith and scorn of wrong,\nAnd cunning lore, and soothing song,\nSnapt in mid-growth, and leaving unaware\nThe flock unsheltered and the pasture bare\nNay, let us take what God shall send,\nTrusting bounty without end.\nGod ever lives; and Nature,\nBeneath His high dictature,\nHale and teeming, can replace\nStrength by strength, and grace by grace,\nHope by hope, and friend by friend:\nTrust; and take what God shall send.\nSo shall Alma Mater see\nDaughters fair and wise\nTrain new lands of liberty\nUnder stranger skies;\nSpreading round the teeming earth\nEnglish science, manhood, worth.\n1862."}
