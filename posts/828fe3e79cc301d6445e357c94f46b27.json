{"subject": "The Profile On The Pillow", "text": "After our fierce loving \nin the brief time we found to be together, \nyou lay in the half light \nexhausted, rich, \nwith your face turned sideways on the pillow \nand I traced the exquisite \nline of your profile, dark against the white, \n\ndelicate and lovely as a child's. \nPerhaps \nyou will cease to love me. \nor we may be consumed in the holocaust, \n\nbut I keep, against the ice and the fire, \nthe memory of your profile on the pillow."}
