{"subject": "I Leave This at Your Ear", "text": "For Nessie Dunsmuir\n\nI leave this at your ear for when you wake,\nA creature in its abstract cage asleep.\nYour dreams blindfold you by the light they make.\n\nThe owl called from the naked-woman tree\nAs I came down by the Kyle farm to hear\nYour house silent by the speaking sea.\n\nI have come late but I have come before\nLater with slaked steps from stone to stone\nTo hope to find you listening for the door.\n\nI stand in the ticking room.  My dear, I take\nA moth kiss from your breath.  The shore gulls cry.\nI leave this at your ear for when you wake."}
