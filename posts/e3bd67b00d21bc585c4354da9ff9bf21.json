{"subject": "Steel-Mills: South Chicago", "text": "This red hush toppling over the sky,\nWanders one step toward the stars\nAnd dies in a questioning shiver.\nThe steel-mill chimneys fling their gaunt seeking\nA little distance into the red\nThat softly combs their smoky hair.\nThe steel-mill chimneys only live at night\nWhen crimson light makes love to them\nAnd star-light trickles through the red,\nLike glimpses of some far-off fairy tale.\nThroughout the day the steel-mill chimneys stand\nRigidly within the wind-whirled glare:\nOnly night can bring them supple straightness.\nII\nFrom the little, brown gate that does not see them\nBecause its eyes are blind with wooing soot,\nAn endless stream of men scatters out\nInto the cool bewilderment of morning.\nUpon their lips a limply child-like surrender\nCurves out to the light, as though they felt\nThe presence of an unassuming strangeness.\nThe morning hides from their eyes:\nThey walk on, in great strides,\nLike blind men swinging over a well-known scene.\nTheir faces twitch with echoes of iron fists:\nTheir faces hold a swarthy stupor\nLoosened by little fingers of morning light\nUntil it droops into reluctant life.\nAnd then their eyes, made flat by night,\nSwell into a Madonna-like surprise\nAt children trooping back in huge disguise.\nthe oranges in lunch-room windows change\nTo sleek suns dipped in sleepy light,\nAnd rounded tarts in china plates\nAre like red heart-beats, resting but not dead.\nA trolley-car speeds by\nAnd seems a strident lyric of motion.\nWagons rumble down the street\nLike drums enticing weariness to step. . . .\nThe hearts of these steel-striding men\nAscend and blend within their eyes,\nAnd yet, these men are unaware of this.\nThey only feel a fluid relief\nVoicing, in a clustered roar,\nThe cries of struggling thoughts unshaped by words.\nBut there are some who break forth from the rest.\nThis old Hungarian strides along\nAnd binds na\u00efvely-winged prayer-sandals\nUpon the heavy feet of shuffling loves.\nGently, he plays with his beard\nAs though his fingers touched a woman's hair.\nAnd this young Slav whose surly blasphemy\nCurls his face into a simple hate,\nHas taken iron into his laugh\nAnd uses it to hew his stony mind.\nWhile this Italian whose deep olive skin\nShines like sunlight groping through dense leaves,\nForgets his battered happiness\nAnd bows with mock grace to his shouting day.\nBeside him is a fellow-countryman\nWalking aimless, dazed with joy of motion.\nUpon his face a glistening vacancy\nLights the mildly querying thoughts\nThat seek each other but never meet.\nBehind him steps a stalwart Pole\nWhose rhythmic, stately insolence\nTurns the sidewalk into a grey carpet,\nGrey as the shades that race across his face\nAnd show the savage squalor of his soul.\nNight has broken her heart upon him,\nOnly scarring his bitter smile.\nA street of little, jack-o'-lantern houses\nVeering into leering saloons,\nWhere the night, a crazy child,\nDips herself in sallow rouge\nAnd chases oaths and heavy mirth\nAnd even human beings:\nWhere the smoky sadness of the steel-mills\nWanders hesitantly into death\nAnd drops a ghostly blur upon this girl.\nHer numbly waxen, cherub face\nEmerges gently from the doorway's blackness\nAs though the dark had given birth to it.\nAnd then the falling light reveals\nThat something of a village hangs about her:\nSomething slumbering and ample.\nThe doorway is too small to hold\nHer shoulders that are like a hill's broad curves\nDwindled in the distance. . . .\nShe is one of many earth-curved girls\nWho listened to the insistent tinkle\nOf wind-winged music from a far-off land:\nListened and knew not\nThat their own hearts faintly played.\nSo she ran to this far phantom,\nOnly finding it within herself\nWhen the city's sly fists rained upon it.\nThen once more she fled\nWith a dead heart whose restless pallor\nCrept to squalid wantonness, for refuge.\nAnd now she stands within this doorway,\nUttering muffled innuendos\nTo the drained men of her race.\nYet, something of a village hangs about her:\nSomething slumbering and ample\nStealing from the earth curves of her shoulders.\nIII\nThe steel-mill workers straggle down this street,\nClanging shut the doorways of their souls,\nAnd the sound rips their lips open.\nThe steel-mill workers do not know of this:\nThey only seek something that will sweeten\nThe dirt that has eaten into their flesh\nAnd change it to raw music.\nThey straggle down this street,\nTheir faces slack and oiled with amorousness.\nLike cats they play with their desires,\nBiting them with little laughs\nUntil the sallow houses draw them in.\nAnd then the night pursues their revelry:\nEchoes from the shut doors of their souls.\nIV\nThree bent women and a child\nStoop before the steel-mill gate\nAs though the morning's ghastly murmur\nWashed against them in a wave\nStiffening them into resisting curves.\nOne is old and floridly misshapen.\nYears have melted out within her frame,\nFlooding her with lukewarm loves.\nThe wrinkles on her flabby face\nAre like a faded scrawl of pain\nScattered by the flesh on which it rests.\nHer frayed shawl hanging unaware of her\nIs a symbol of her heart.\nThe woman standing at her side\nIs tall and like a slanting scarecrow\nColdly jerking in the morning's glare.\nOnly when she lifts a bony hand\nTapping life against her face,\nDoes the image disappear.\nDead dreams dangle in her heart,\nLimply hanging from their rainbow sashes,\nAnd whenever one sash trembles,\nThen, she lifts a gnarled hand to her face\nAnd tastes a moment of departing life.\nNear her stands a slimly rigid woman\nWith an iron fear upon her bones.\nA worn straight-jacket of lines\nCuts the dying youth upon her face.\nThe slender child beside her,\nBuried within staidly murky clothes,\nGlances frightenedly up at her mother:\nGlances as one who dances to a gate\nAnd fumbles for a latch that hides itself.\nThen from the rusty-reveried steel-mill gate\nAn endless stream of men scatter out\nInto the cool bewilderment of morning.\nUpon their lips a limply child-like surrender\nCurves out to the light, as though they felt\nThe presence of an unassuming strangeness."}
