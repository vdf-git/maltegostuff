{"subject": "An Acrostic Upon A Young Woman, Written By Her Lover", "text": "HAIL sweetest charmer of the rural plain,\nAccept the tribute of a humble swain;\nNor frown, tho' he presumpt'ous would essay;\nNo muse your matchless beauties can display.\nAll that is feign'd of the fair Cyprian queen. \nHere in this lovely damsel may be seen.\nIn her fair form is ev'ry grace combin'd;\nVirtue and modesty adorn her mind.\nIf Milton's eloquence did grace my lays,\nSure it would fail, and speak but half her praise.\nO Cupid fix an arrow in her breast!\nNo more I'd wish, were I of her possess'd."}
