{"subject": "We Go No More To The Forest", "text": "WE go no more to the forest,  \n The rimus are all cut down.  \nThey are built into roof and sill and wall,  \nInto floors that thrill to the last foot-fall  \n In the dancing of the town.         \n\nWe go no more to the forest,  \n The kauris are all cut down.  \nThey are built into ships so stout and strong,  \nBearing their cargoes safe along,  \n Sailing from town to town.         \n\nWe go no more to the forest,  \n The ratas are all cut down.  \nThere are cornfields, golden and green and wide,  \nFor the tangled depths where a world might hide,  \n And our lawns lie smooth in town.         \n\nWe go no more to the forest:  \n Young, wild things are all cut down.  \nWe are buying and selling and making love,  \nAs the grown folk do, with a roof above,  \n And our hearts are at home in town."}
