{"subject": "Shadow of Myself", "text": "I know well enough that this image\nFixed for ever in my mind\nIs not you, but the shadow\nOf love which exists in me\nWhile my time is still not run out.\n\nSo you seem to me my love made visible,\nEndowed by me with that very grace\nWhich makes me suffer, weep and despair\nOf everything at times, but at others\nLIfts me up to the zenith of our life,\nPossessing the joys granted only\nTo the chosen few beyond the world.\n\nAnd although I know this I then think\nThat without you, without the rare\nExcuse which you gave me, my love,\nNow a tenderness outside me,\nWould today be there within\nSleeping still and lying in hope\nOf someone who, at his call, at last\nWould set it beating joyfully.\n\nThen I thank you and say to you;\nFor this I came into the world, to await you;\nTo live because of you, as you live\nBecause of me, even though you do not know it,\nBecause of this deep love I have for you."}
