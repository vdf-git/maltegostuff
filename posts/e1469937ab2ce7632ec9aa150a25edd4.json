{"subject": "Wild Flowers", "text": "Content Primroses,\nWith hearts at rest in your thick leaves' soft care,\nPeeping as from his mother's lap the child\nWho courts shy shelter from his own open air!-\nHanging Harebell,\nWhose blue heaven to no wanderer ever closes,\nThough thou still lookest earthward from thy domed cell!-\nFluttering-wild\nAnemone, so well\nNamed of the Wind, to whom thou, fettered-free,\nYieldest thee, helpless-wilfully,\nWith \nTake me or leave me,\nSweet Wind, I am thine own Anemone\n!-\nThirsty Arum, ever dreaming\nOf lakes in wildernesses gleaming!-\nFire-winged Pimpernel,\nCommuning with some hidden well,\nAnd secrets with the sun-god holding,\nAt fixed hour folding and unfolding!-\nHow is it with you, children all,\nWhen human children on you fall,\nGather you in eager haste,\nSpoil your plenty with their waste-\nFill and fill their dropping hands?\nFeel you hurtfully disgraced\nBy their injurious demands?\nDo you know them from afar,\nShuddering at their merry hum,\nGrowing faint as near they come?\nBlind and deaf they think you are-\nIs it only ye are dumb?\nYou alive at least, I think,\nTrembling almost on the brink\nOf our lonely consciousness:\nIf it be so,\nTake this comfort for your woe,\nFor the breaking of your rest,\nFor the tearing in your breast,\nFor the blotting of the sun,\nFor the death too soon begun,\nFor all else beyond redress-\nOr what seemeth so to be-\nThat the children's wonder-springs\nBubble high at sight of you,\nLovely, lowly, common things:\nIn you more than you they see!\nTake this too-that, walking out,\nLooking fearlessly about,\nYe rebuke our manhood's doubt,\nAnd our childhood's faith renew;\nSo that we, with old age nigh,\nSeeing you alive and well\nOut of winter's crucible,\nHearing you, from graveyard crept,\nTell us that ye only slept-\nThink we die not, though we die.\n\nThus ye die not, though ye die-\nOnly yield your being up,\nLike a nectar-holding cup:\nDeaf, ye give to them that hear,\nWith a greatness lovely-dear;\nBlind, ye give to them that see-\nPoor, but bounteous royally.\nLowly servants to the higher,\nBurning upwards in the fire\nOf Nature's endless sacrifice,\nIn great Life's ascent ye rise,\nLeave the lowly earth behind,\nPass into the human mind,\nPass with it up into God,\nWhence ye came though through the clod-\nPass, and find yourselves at home\nWhere but life can go and come;\nWhere all life is in its nest,\nAt loving one with holy Best;-\nWho knows?-with shadowy, dawning sense\nOf a past, age-long somnolence!"}
