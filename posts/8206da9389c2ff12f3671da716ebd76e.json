{"subject": "The Concert", "text": "No, I will go alone.\nI will come back when it's over.\nYes, of course I love you.\nNo, it will not be long.\nWhy may you not come with me?\u2014\nYou are too much my lover.\nYou would put yourself\nBetween me and song.\n\nIf I go alone,\nQuiet and suavely clothed,\nMy body will die in its chair,\nAnd over my head a flame,\nA mind that is twice my own, \nWill mark with icy mirth\nThe wise advance and retreat\nOf armies without a country,\nStorming a nameless gate,\nHurling terrible javelins down\nFrom the shouting walls of a singing town\n\nWhere no women wait!\nArmies clean of love and hate,\nMarching lines of pitiless sound\nClimbing hills to the sun and hurling\nGolden spears to the ground!\nUp the lines a silver runner\nBearing a banner whereon is scored\nThe milk and steel of a bloodless wound\nHealed at length by the sword!\n\nYou and I have nothing to do with music.\nWe may not make of music a filigree frame,\nWithin which you and I,\nTenderly glad we came,\nSit smiling, hand in hand.\n\nCome now, be content.\nI will come back to you, I swear I will;\nAnd you will know me still.\nI shall be only a little taller\nThan when I went."}
