{"subject": "Spring", "text": "Rosy morn is brightly breaking,\nCheerful birds melodious sing,\nEarth with thankful songs awaking\nHails with joy the merry Spring,\nSilver clouds in sunlight glowing\nSlowly float the azure dome,\nTender flowers are sweetly blowing\nRound each cozy cottage home.\n\nDreary winter's icy fingers\nHave released the bending tree,\nGenial life reviving, lingers\nO'er the cold and sterile lea.\nFrom the rocky, snow-clad mountains,\nWhere the breath of sunny Spring\nHas unfettered muffled fountains,\nHear the songs of gladness ring.\n\nIn the morn of playful childhood,\nWith dear friends 'mid sylvan bowers,\nO'er the fields and through the wildwood,\nCulling all the choicest flow'rs;\nTwining wreaths, each other crowning,\nDew-drops bright for royal gems,\nNe'er a thought of worldly frowning\nOn the precious diadems.\n\nMarched we on with true devotion,\nWhile the scenes of after years,\nStirr'd the spirits deep emotion,\nWith alternate hopes and fears.\nWhile before us lay life's prizes,\nDazzling in the sunlight gleam,-\nHow we gazed with sad surprises,\nWhen they vanished like a dream.\n\nMany happy hearts grew weary,\nRosy cheeks grew pale and white,\nPleasant paths grew dark and dreary,\nSwept by storms of withering blight;\nHow the changing years have fleeted,\nStrewing wrecks on either side,\nCherished schemes have been defeated,\nAnd the cares of age abide.\n\nBut when cheery Spring advances,\nCrowned with gems of beauty rare,\nPleasure like a fairy, dances\nO'er the landscape everywhere,\nAnd the tide of life flows higher,\nGloom's dark curtains are withdrawn,\nAnd again youth's hidden fire,\nThrills me as in life's fresh dawn."}
