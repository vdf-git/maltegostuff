{"subject": "Under-Song", "text": "There is music in the strong\nDeep-throated bush,\nWhisperings of song\nHeard in the leaves' hush - \nBallads of the trees\nIn tongues unknown - \nA reminiscent tone\nOn minor keys\u2026\n\nBoughs swaying to and fro\nThough no winds pass\u2026\nFaint odors in the grass\nWhere no flowers grow,\nAnd flutterings of wings\nAnd faint first notes,\nOnce babbled on the boughs\nOf faded springs.\n\nIs it music from the graves\nOf all things fair\nTrembling on the staves\nOf spacious air - \nFluted by the winds\nSongs with no words - \nSonatas from the throats\nOf master birds?\n\nOne peering through the husk\nOf darkness thrown\nMay hear it in the dusk - \nThat ancient tone,\nSilvery as the light\nOf long dead stars\nYet falling through the night\nIn trembling bars."}
