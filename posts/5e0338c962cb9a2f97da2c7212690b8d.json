{"subject": "The Centaurs", "text": "Up came the young Centaur-colts from the plains they were\nfathered in--\nCurious, awkward, afraid.\nBurrs on their hocks and their tails, they were branded and gathered in\nMobs and run up to the yard to be made.\n\nStarting and shying at straws, with sidlings and plungings,\nBuckings and whirlings and bolts;\nGreener than grass, but full-ripe for their bridling and lungings,\nUp to the yards and to Chiron they bustled the colts...\n\nFirst the light web and the cavesson; then the linked keys\nTo jingle and turn on the tongue. Then, with cocked ears,\nThe hours of watching and envy, while comrades at ease\nPassaged and backed, making naught of these terrible gears.\n\nNext, over-pride and its price at the low-seeming fence\nToo oft and too easily taken -- the world-beheld fall!\nAnd none in the yard except Chiron to doubt the immense,\nIrretrievable shame of it all!...\n\nLast, the trained squadron, full-charge -- the sound of a going\nThrough dust and spun clods, and strong kicks, pelted in as\nthey went,\nAnd repaid at top-speed; till the order to halt without slowing\nShowed every colt on his haunches--and Chiron content!"}
