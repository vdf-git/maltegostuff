{"subject": "Song", "text": "At her Junior High School graduation,\nshe sings alone\nin front of the lot of us--\n\nher voice soprano, surprising,\nalmost a woman's. It is\nthe Our Father in French,\n\nthe new language\nmaking her strange, out there,\nfully fledged and\n\nready for anything. Sitting\ntogether -- her separated\nmother and father -- we can\n\nhear the racket of traffic\nshaking the main streets\nof Jersey City as she sings\n\nDeliver us from evil,\nand I wonder can she see me\nin the dark here, years\n\nfrom belief, on the edge\nof tears. It doesn't matter. She\ndoesn't miss a beat, keeps\n\nin time, in tune, while into\nour common silence I whisper,\nSing, love, sing your heart out!"}
