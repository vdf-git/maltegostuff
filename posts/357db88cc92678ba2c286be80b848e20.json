{"subject": "To A Friend In London, Upon My Returning To College", "text": "While You, dear Tom, in London City,\nAssociate with the fair and witty,\nAnd, gayly rambling o'er the Town,\nTake the brisk Juice in Bumpers down;\nOr, charm'd with the persuasive Stage,\nLaugh at the Follies of the Age;\nTo College wretched I return,\nAnd Day and Night with Spleen I burn:\nFrom jovial Friends, from Pipe and Bottle,\nTo Pray'rs and musty Aristotle,\nFrom decent Meals, and wholsome Wines,\nTo foggy Coll. and Mutton Loins,\nFrom well--bred Mirth, to stupid Puns,\nOf Pedants and of College Dons,\nMy happy course of Life I change;\nNo more I dress, no more I range,\nBut pensive mope within all Day,\nAnd sleep and rhime the Hours away;\nA gentle Song to Laura send,\nOr scribble something to my Friend;\nThis Morning, as I stalk'd about,\nThese Lines to thee I hammer'd out.\n\nThou, TOM, with Rapture and Delight,\nEnjo'st the fair one in thy Sight,\nThe fair one too perhaps on thee,\nSmiles, as she tattles o'er her Tea:\nWhilst far from these distracted Eyes,\nMy absent Laura's Image flies,\nTo her my constant Thoughts I bend,\nIn Sighs to her my Wishes send;\nIn vain from Sighs I hope Relief,\nAnd Thinking but augments my Grief;\nHer distant Lips I seem to kiss,\nAnd cheat my self with fancy'd Bliss.\n\nExcuse me, that I say no more,\nMy Veins with raging Fires boil o'er,\nWild roll my Eyes, my Heart grows sad,\nPox take me if I don't run mad."}
