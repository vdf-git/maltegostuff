{"subject": "Easter Hymn", "text": "'Tis morn in Joseph's garden now\nWhere death and night and darkness were,\nThe lilies still in sadness bow\nAround the Saviour's sepulcher,\nAngels in shining garments clad\nSpeak first the word that mortals heed\n'Till Nature, wrapt in gloom, is glad;\nThe Lord is risen, is risen indeed.\n\nGladly they bear the message on\nWho stood beside His empty tomb,\nThe night is o'er, the darkness gone\nThe angels sing, the lilies bloom.\nPowerless the chains of death to bind\nThe captive from their bondage freed,\nDeath's dreary dungeon left behind,\nThe Lord is risen, is risen indeed.\n\nAs rose the sun above the heights\nChasing the gloom from earth and skies\nBehold above the night of nights\nThe Sun or Righteousness arise;\nBurst are the chains of death and hell,\nGo ye, who hear the message, speed,\nAbove the graves of nations tell\nThe Lord is risen, is risen indeed.\n\n'Tis morn upon the earth, once more,\nSweet Easter morn when lilies spring\nTo greet the sun from shore to shore\nAnd saints rejoice and angels sing;\nAll nature now breaks forth in song\nAnd Easter anthem angels lead\nWith joyful hearts the strains prolong,\nThe Lord is risen, is risen indeed.\n\n'Tis morn, the gospel light has streamed\nFrom Africa's coast to India's strand,\nThe dawn of which the prophet dreamed\nIs flooding each benighted land.\nAbove the vanities of men\nO'er crumbling shrine and moldering creed\nHigh o'er the mountain tops of sin\nThe Lord is risen, is risen indeed."}
