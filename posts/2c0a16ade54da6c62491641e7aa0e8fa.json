{"subject": "An Orphan's Lament", "text": "She's gone -- and twice the summer's sun\nHas gilt Regina's towers,\nAnd melted wild Angora's snows,\nAnd warmed Exina's bowers. \nThe flowerets twice on hill and dale\nHave bloomed and died away,\nAnd twice the rustling forest leaves\nHave fallen to decay,\n\nAnd thrice stern winter's icy hand\nHas checked the river's flow,\nAnd three times o'er the mountains thrown\nHis spotless robe of snow.\n\nTwo summers springs and autumns sad\nThree winters cold and grey --\nAnd is it then so long ago\nThat wild November day!\n\nThey say such tears as children weep\nWill soon be dried away,\nThat childish grief however strong\nIs only for a day,\n\nAnd parted friends how dear soe'er\nWill soon forgotten be;\nIt may be so with other hearts,\nIt is not thus with me.\n\nMy mother, thou wilt weep no more\nFor thou art gone above,\nBut can I ever cease to mourn\nThy good and fervent love?\n\nWhile that was mine the world to me\nWas sunshine bright and fair;\nNo feeling rose within my heart\nBut thou couldst read it there.\n\nAnd thou couldst feel for all my joys\nAnd all my childish cares\nAnd never weary of my play\nOr scorn my foolish fears.\n\nBeneath thy sweet maternal smile\nAll pain and sorrow fled,\nAnd even the very tears were sweet\nUpon thy bosom shed.\n\nThy loss can never be repaired;\nI shall not know again\nWhile life remains, the peaceful joy\nThat filled my spirit then.\n\nWhere shall I find a heart like thine\nWhile life remains to me,\nAnd where shall I bestow the love\nI ever bore for thee?\n\nA.H."}
