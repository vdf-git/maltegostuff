{"subject": "Strife", "text": "The wind fought with the angry trees.\nAll morning in immense unease\nThey wrestled, and ruin strawed the ground,\nAnd the north sky frowned.\nThe oak and aspen arms were held\nDefiant, but the death was knelled\nOf slender saplings, snappy boughs,\nTwigs brittle as men's vows.\nHow moaned the trees the struggle through!\nAnger almost to madness grew.\nThe aspen screamed, and came a roar\nOf the great wind locked in anguish sore,\nDesolate with defeat ... and then\nQuiet fell again:\nThe trees slept quiet as great cows\nThat lie at noon under broad boughs.\nHow pure, how strange the calm; but hist!...\nWas it the trees by the wind kissed?\nOr from afar, where the wind's hid,\nA throb, a sob?"}
