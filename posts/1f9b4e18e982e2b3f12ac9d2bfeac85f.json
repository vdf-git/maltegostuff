{"subject": "The Cougar And The Bull", "text": "Way back up in the high country, where the air is clean and pure. \nIn a cave right next to a nice cool stream, lived a mean and hungry cougar. \nNow a big old ball came wandering by, just a munchin' down on grass, \nBut he got too close to the cougar's den, and the cat couldn't let the chance pass. \nHe jumped onto that big old bull and took a great big bite. \nCougar and bull went round and round but that cat finally won the fight. \nWhy, he ate that entire bull, thought it took him a day and a night. \nTil all that was left was a pile of bones, and that cat was filled with delight. \nThat big cat was feeling so proud, be roared as the day grew hot. \nBut a hunter nearby heard him roaring, and killed that cat with one shot. \nNow the moral of this story is, Don't go acting like a mutt. \nRemember, if your full of bull, just keep your big mouth shut."}
