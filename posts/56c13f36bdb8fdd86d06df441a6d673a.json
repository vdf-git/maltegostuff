{"subject": "Jewelled Seaweed", "text": "Jewelled seaweed,\nProvince of Sanuki:\nIs it your nature that\nThe sight of you will never sate?\nIs it that your guardian god\nIs paramount?\nWith heaven and earth,\nAnd sun and moon,\nMay you endure.\nToward one divine face,\nWe continue on our journey,\nOut the rivermouth at Naka,\nFloating in our boat.\nAs we come rowing,\nThe seasonal wind\nBlows from the distant sky;\nFrom offshore, I see \nThe crashing breakers;\nI see the coast,\nAmong the roaring white caps;\nHunting whales\nThe sea, I fear it.\nOur bobbing boat,\nWarps its oars.\nAll around\nThere are many islands, yet\nOn the famous\nIsle of Samine,\nOn the rocky, wave-wracked sea coast\nWe make landfall and see\nAmong the waves' sound\nEver on the seashore,\nA folded mulberry-cloth\nPillow have you made,\nOn a rough and rocky bed\nYou lay down:\nIf I knew your home\nI would go and tell them;\nIf your wife knew\nShe would come inquiring;\nJeweled spear straight\nYour path, though she knows it not;\nWorriedly,\nIs she waiting, loving you\nThat darling wife of yours"}
