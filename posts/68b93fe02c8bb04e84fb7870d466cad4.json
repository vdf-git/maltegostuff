{"subject": "Reading of history", "text": "As plum flowers revolt, the hostile dews \nSafeguard the darkness engraved by the midday sword \nThe revolution will start next morning \nThe plaint of widows is like a wolf pack racing across the frozen plain\n\nDue to a prophecy, ancestors retreat into \nThat river where faith argues hectically with desire\nThere is no end, there is only a vortical recluse \nExperiencing another meditative tranquillity\n\nClimbing high to behold sunset over the throne\nAs civilisation drifts off with the flute music in the empty valley\nSeasons stand up from the debris and \nFruits creep over the walls to chase tomorrow\n\nTranslation:  Tao Naikan and Simon Patton"}
