{"subject": "Sonnet Xxxvii:  The Love-Moon", "text": "'When that dead face, bowered in the furthest years,\nWhich once was all the life years held for thee,\nCan now scarce bid the tides of memory\nCast on thy soul a little spray of tears,\u2014\nHow canst thou gaze into these eyes of hers\nWhom now thy heart delights in, and not see\nWithin each orb Love's philtred euphrasy\nMake them of buried troth remembrancers?\u201d\n\u201cNay, pitiful Love, nay, loving Pity! Well\nThou knowest that in these twain I have confess'd\nTwo very voices of thy summoning bell.\nNay, Master, shall not Death make manifest\nIn these the culminant changes which approve\nThe love-moon that must light my soul to Love?\u201d"}
