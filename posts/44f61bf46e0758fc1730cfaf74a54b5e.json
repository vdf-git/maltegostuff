{"subject": "Sires And Sons", "text": "Wild wanton Luxury lays waste the land\nWith difficulty tilled by Thrift's hard hand!\nThen dies the State!-and, in its carcass found,\nThe millionaires, all maggot-like, abound.\nAlas! was it for this that Warren died,\nAnd Arnold sold himself to t' other side,\nStark piled at Bennington his British dead,\nAnd Gates at Camden, Lee at Monmouth, fled?\nFor this that Perry did the foeman fleece,\nAnd Hull surrender to preserve the peace?\nDegenerate countrymen, renounce, I pray,\nThe slothful ease, the luxury, the gay\nAnd gallant trappings of this idle life,\nAnd be more fit for one another's wife."}
