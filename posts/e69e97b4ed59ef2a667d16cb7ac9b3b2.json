{"subject": "A Song For Rifle Clubs", "text": "Hurrah for the Rifle! - In days long ago\nOur fathers were fear'd for the bill and the bow,\nAnd Edwards and Harrys in battles of old\nWere proud of their archers so burly and bold:\nWhile Agincourt, Cressy, and Poictiers long since,\nWith great John of Gaunt, and the gallant Black Prince,\nTell out from old ages of history still\nWhat Englishmen did with the bow and the bill.\n\nHurrah for the Rifle! - When England requires,\nShe still shall be proud of the sons of our sires;\nAnd rifle and bayonet then shall do more\nThan ever did billhook or longbow of yore;\nFrom hedgerow and coppice and cottage and farm\nThe foreigner's welcome, God wot! shall be warm, \nAnd the crack of the rifle shall hint to the foe\nHow terrible once was the twang of the bow."}
