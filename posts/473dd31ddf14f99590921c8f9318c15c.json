{"subject": "My Dark Room", "text": "My dark room, I'm in a place I should feel safe;  \nWhy do I long to escape from fear I do not understand?  \nWanting to be okay, telling myself I can.  In my mind, I walk through a meadow of flowers;  \nStopping to smell their sweet aroma, hoping it will  \nHeal this stress, of the death that is bound to rest;  \nRest, why should it? I'm not dead, neither are you;  But, your presence is gone, so why do we both hurt  \nAnd long, long to change the things we made so wrong?  Wrong, wrong to others. Leaving us both apart and  \nSmothered of deep pain, of the loss of our hands that  \nDo not touch, that reached our hearts and meant so  \nMuch.  I'll walk one day in the bright sunlight, alone  \nI'll be and I'll feel your soul surround me.  Then I'll return to my dark room;  \nPraying God will stop the doom."}
