{"subject": "Fishing With Daddy", "text": "One day I walked with Daddy\n Down by a little brook.\n There he placed a big red worm\n Upon my fishing hook.\n We sat together 'neath a tree\n And did some fishing there.\n Daddy told me wondrous stories\n Of hunting elk and bear.\n He talked of when he was a boy -\n Of roads and tunnels he would build.\n How he would dream his day away\n As he worked in the cotton field.\n He spoke of foreign lands he'd seen -\n How big ships come and go.\n Of giant derricks, gushing oil,\n And making angels in the snow.\n He talked of Mom, his only love; How proud he was of me.\n Of our country - as it was -so rich and wild and free.\n When the sun was setting across the little brook,\n We started homeward, hand in hand, with a worm still on my hook."}
