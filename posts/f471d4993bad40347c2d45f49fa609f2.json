{"subject": "Theodore Roosevelt", "text": "Now with the dust that bore him he is one, \nSilent, into into earth's silent maw ye laid him. \nDimmed is his light, as with the setting sun, \nHe folds his steps unto the God who made him. \nWhen shall the weak stand and rejoice again \nTo see his banner in the battle's light? \nWhen shall the humble hear his voice again \nRaised from the mountain of majestic right? \nO ye shall see that banner gleam again \nHigh o'er the ramparts of a nation's goal; \nO ye shall hear that voice redeem again \nThe blood-stained conscience of a nation's soul. \nRise ye that tremble 'mid such fearful moan, \nHe stands annointed at Jehovah's throne."}
