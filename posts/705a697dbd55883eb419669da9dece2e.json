{"subject": "City Lyrics", "text": "\u2019Tis seldom that \u201ccoolness\u201d entices,\nand love is no better for chilling\u2014\nbut come up to Thompson's for ices,\nand cool your warm heart for a shilling!\nWhat perfume comes balmily o\u2019er us?\nMint juleps from city hotel!\nA loafer is smoking before us\u2014\n(a nasty cigar, by the smell!)\nOh woman! Thou secret past knowing!\nLike lilacs that grow by the wall,\nyou breathe every air that is going,\nyet gather but sweetness from all!\nOn, on! By St. Paul\u2019s, and the Astor!\nReligion seems very ill-plann\u2019d!\nFor one day we list to the pastor,\nfor six days we list to the band!\nThe sermon may dwell on the future,\nthe organ your pulses may calm\u2014\nwhen\u2014pest!\u2014that remember\u2019d cachucha\nupsets both the sermon and psalm!\nOh, pity the love that must utter\nwhile goes a swift omnibus by!\n(though sweet is I scream1 when the flutter\nof fans shows thermometers high)\u2014\nbut if what I bawl, or I mutter,\nfalls into your ear but to die,\noh, the dew that falls into the gutter\nis not more unhappy than I!"}
