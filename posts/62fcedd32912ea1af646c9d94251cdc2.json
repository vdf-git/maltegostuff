{"subject": "Spring", "text": "Stern Winter now, by Spring repress'd\nForbears the long-continued strife;\nAnd Nature, on her naked breast,\nDelights to catch the gales of life.\n\nNow o'er the rural kingdom roves,\nSoft pleasures with her laughing train,\nLove warbles in the vocal groves,\nAnd vegetation plants the plain. \n\nUnhappy! whom to beds of pain\nArthritic tyranny consigns;\nWhom smiling Nature courts in vain,\nThough rapture sings and beauty shines.\n\nYet though my limbs disease invades,\nHer wings imagination tries,\nAnd bears me to the peaceful shades,\nWhere ---- 's humble turrets rise.\n\nHere let me through the vales pursue,\nA guide - a father - and a friend,\nOnce more great Nature's works renew,\nOnce more on Wisdom's voice attend.\n\nFrom false caresses, causeless strife,\nWild hope, vain fear, alike removed;\nHere let me learn the use of life,\nWhen best enjoy'd - when most improved.\n\nTeach me, thou venerable bower,\nCool meditation's quiet seat,\nThe generous scorn of venal power,\nThe silent grandeur of retreat.\n\nWhen pride by guilt to greatness climbs,\nOr raging factions rush to war,\nHere let me learn to shun the crimes\nI can't prevent and will not share.\n\nBut lest I fall by subtler foes,\nBright wisdom teach me Curio's art,\nThe swelling passions to compose,\nAnd quell the rebels of the heart."}
