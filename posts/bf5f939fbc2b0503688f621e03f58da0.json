{"subject": "Circus in Three Rings", "text": "In the circus tent of a hurricane\ndesigned by a drunken god\nmy extravagant heart blows up again\nin a rampage of champagne-colored rain\nand the fragments whir like a weather vane\nwhile the angels all applaud.\n\nDaring as death and debonair\nI invade my lion's den;\na rose of jeopardy flames in my hair\nyet I flourish my whip with a fatal flair\ndefending my perilous wounds with a chair\nwhile the gnawings of love begin.\n\nMocking as Mephistopheles,\neclipsed by magician's disguise,\nmy demon of doom tilts on a trapeze,\nwinged rabbits revolving about his knees,\nonly to vanish with devilish ease\nin a smoke that sears my eyes."}
