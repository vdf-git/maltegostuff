{"subject": "The Phantom Of The Rose", "text": "Sweet lady, let your lids unclose.--\nThose lids by maiden dreams caressed;\nI am the phantom of the rose\nYou wore last night upon your breast.\nLike pearls upon my petals lay\nThe weeping fountain's silver tears,\nEre in the glittering array\nYou bore me proudly 'mid your peers.\n\nO lady, 'twas for you I died--\nYet have I come and will I stay;\nMy rosy phantom by your side\nWill linger till the break of day.\nYet fear not, lady; naught claim I--\nNor mass, nor hymn, or funeral prayer;\nMy soul is but a perfumed sigh,\nWhich pure from Paradise I bear.\n\nMy death is as my life was--sweet;\nWho would not die as I have done?\nA fate like mine who would not meet,\nYour bosom fair to lie upon?\nA poet on my sentient tomb\nEngraved this legend with a kiss:\n'Here lies a rose of fairest bloom;\nE'en kings are jealous of its bliss."}
