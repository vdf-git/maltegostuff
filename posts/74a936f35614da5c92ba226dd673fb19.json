{"subject": "Comfort", "text": "SPEAK low to me, my Saviour, low and sweet\nFrom out the hallelujahs, sweet and low\nLest I should fear and fall, and miss Thee so\nWho art not missed by any that entreat.\nSpeak to mo as to Mary at thy feet !\nAnd if no precious gums my hands bestow,\nLet my tears drop like amber while I go\nIn reach of thy divinest voice complete\nIn humanest affection -- thus, in sooth,\nTo lose the sense of losing. As a child,\nWhose song-bird seeks the wood for evermore\nIs sung to in its stead by mother's mouth\nTill, sinking on her breast, love-reconciled,\nHe sleeps the faster that he wept before."}
