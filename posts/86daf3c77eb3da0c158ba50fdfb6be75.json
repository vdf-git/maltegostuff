{"subject": "Corpus Vile", "text": "Some museums of antiquities store row on row of\nunnamed skulls.  There is a day of reckoning now\na plea to repatriate lost souls, bring home bones \n\nto territorial rest.  Is it surprising the rituals we wrap \nround death?  Anguish felt at bodies missing, ungraved, \nwhen loss is certain?  How many symbolic coffins \n\nhave been lowered, wounds eased with the thud \nof gentle earth on unimagined emptiness?   There is \nfierce beauty in a skeleton picked clean as carrion,\n\na recycling of our elementalness.  Here, in this museum, \nskeletons catalogued, studied carefully, are unlikely\nto raise a court case.  Few would want these bones back,\n\na rickle of deformity.  Yet there is beauty in these harp\nshapes: curved, sculptural.  A spine bent back upon itself, \nwith vertebrae on which a seraph might make music.\n\nI remember visiting a little girl in hospital, one Sunday,\na steel rod newly planted in her clarsach of a back; by\nthe next Sunday, stringed melody: for her, hinc sanitas. \n\nLeaving the museum, how fine to see children jostle \nfor a bus; tall, straight; even their teeth wondrously \naligned, their body temples still unplundered.\n\nRickle: (Scots) a rickety structure or collection"}
