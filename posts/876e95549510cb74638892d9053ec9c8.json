{"subject": "A STRAY DREAM", "text": "It's a happy dream though in it you were\nHumping some dancer in a run down gaff\n\nA seafront hotel out of season where\nI'm in a kitchen on the single bed\n\nI've pulled from a drawer like the silk scarf \nOf the seafront carny man who's filling in for\n\nManDuck The Magician star of stage and screen\nI saw earlier that day at the end of the pier\n\nI had sheets of Belfast linen but you \nHad the dancer. And had her again\n\nWhile the dawn struggled to break on the sea\nAnd break on the quick and the slow and the dead\n\nWhen I woke the next morning under the bed\nDustdevils, feathers and some child's brown shoes"}
