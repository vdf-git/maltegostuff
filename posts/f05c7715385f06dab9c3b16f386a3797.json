{"subject": "Christmas Night Of '62", "text": "The wintry blast goes wailing by,\nThe snow is falling overhead;\nI hear the lonely sentry's tread,\nAnd distant watch-fires light the sky.\n\nDim forms go flitting through the gloom;\nThe soldiers cluster round the blaze\nTo talk of other Christmas days,\nAnd softly speak of home and home.\n\nMy sabre swinging overhead\nGleams in the watch-fire's fitful glow,\nWhile fiercely drives the blinding snow,\nAnd memory leads me to the dead.\n\nMy thoughts go wandering to and fro,\nVibrating between the Now and Then;\nI see the low-browed home again,\nThe old hall wreathed with mistletoe.\n\nAnd sweetly from the far-off years\nComes borne the laughter faint and low,\nThe voices of the Long Ago!\nMy eyes are wet with tender tears.\n\nI feel again the mother-kiss,\nI see again the glad surprise\nThat lightened up the tranquil eyes\nAnd brimmed them o'er with tears of bliss,\n\nAs, rushing from the old hall-door,\nShe fondly clasped her wayward boy-\nHer face all radiant with the joy\nShe felt to see him home once more.\n\nMy sabre swinging on the bough\nGleams in the watch-fire's fitful glow,\nWhile fiercely drives the blinding snow\nAslant upon my saddened brow.\n\nThose cherished faces all are gone!\nAsleep within the quiet graves\nWhere lies the snow in drifting waves,-\nAnd I am sitting here alone.\n\nThere's not a comrade here to-night\nBut knows that loved ones far away\nOn bended knee this night will pray:\n'God bring our darling from the fight.'\n\nBut there are none to wish me back,\nFor me no yearning prayers arise.\nThe lips are mute and closed the eyes-\nMy home is in the bivouac."}
