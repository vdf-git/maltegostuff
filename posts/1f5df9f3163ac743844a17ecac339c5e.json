{"subject": "To Nannette Falk-Auerbach", "text": "Oft as I hear thee, wrapt in heavenly art,\n The massive message of Beethoven tell\nWith thy ten fingers to the people's heart\n As if ten tongues told news of heaven and hell, --\nGazing on thee, I mark that not alone,\n Ah, not alone, thou sittest:  there, by thee,\nBeethoven's self, dear living lord of tone,\n Doth stand and smile upon thy mastery.\nFull fain and fatherly his great eyes glow:\n He says, \"From Heaven, my child, I heard thee call\n(For, where an artist plays, the sky is low):\n Yea, since my lonesome life did lack love's all,\n  In death, God gives me thee:  thus, quit of pain,\n  Daughter, Nannette! in thee I live again.\""}
