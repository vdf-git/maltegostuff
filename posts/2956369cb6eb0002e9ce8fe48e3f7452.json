{"subject": "God's Garden", "text": "God made a beatous garden\nWith lovely flowers strown,\nBut one straight, narrow pathway\nThat was not overgrown.\nAnd to this beauteous garden\nHe brought mankind to live,\nAnd said: 'To you, my children,\nThese lovely flowers I give.\nPrune ye my vines and fig trees,\nWith care my flowerets tend,\nBut keep the pathway open\nYour home is at the end.'\n\nThen came another master,\nWho did not love mankind,\nAnd planted on the pathway\nGold flowers for them to find.\nAnd mankind saw the bright flowers,\nThat, glitt'ring in the sun,\nQuite hid the thorns of av'rice\nThat poison blood and bone;\nAnd far off many wandered,\nAnd when life's night came on,\nThey still were seeking gold flowers,\nLost, helpless and alone.\nO, cease to heed the glamour\nThat blinds your foolish eyes,\nLook upward to the glitter\nOf stars in God's clear skies.\nTheir ways are pure and harmless\nAnd will not lead astray,\nBid aid your erring footsteps\nTo keep the narrow way.\nAnd when the sun shines brightly\nTend flowers that God has given\nAnd keep the pathway open\nThat leads you on to heaven."}
