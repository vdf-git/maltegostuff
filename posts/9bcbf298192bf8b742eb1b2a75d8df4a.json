{"subject": "Dark View", "text": "The sun that puts its spokes in every\nWheel of manhandle and tree\n\nDerives its path of seashines\n(Sheer centrifugality) from my\n\nRegards. I send it\nMy regards. Some yards\n\nOf lumen from the fabrika\nHave come unbolted from the look\n\nOf it (or likes of me), a long\nUnweaving or recarding I\n\nCannot recall begun, and there\nBefore my eyes a palm\n\nPuts lashes round the sun."}
