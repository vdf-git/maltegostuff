{"subject": "The Wind Is Without There And Howls In The Trees", "text": "THE wind is without there and howls in the trees,\nAnd the rain-flurries drum on the glass:\nAlone by the fireside with elbows on knees\nI can number the hours as they pass.\nYet now, when to cheer me the crickets begin,\nAnd my pipe is just happily lit,\nBelieve me, my friend, tho' the evening draws in,\nThat not all uncontested I sit.\n\nAlone, did I say?  O no, nowise alone\nWith the Past sitting warm on my knee,\nTo gossip of days that are over and gone,\nBut still charming to her and to me.\nWith much to be glad of and much to deplore,\nYet, as these days with those we compare,\nBelieve me, my friend, tho' the sorrows seem more\nThey are somehow more easy to bear.\n\nAnd thou, faded Future, uncertain and frail,\nAs I cherish thy light in each draught,\nHis lamp is not more to the miner - their sail\nIs not more to the crew on the raft.\nFor Hope can make feeble ones earnest and brave,\nAnd, as forth thro' the years I look on,\nBelieve me, my friend, between this and the grave,\nI see wonderful things to be done.\n\nTo do or to try; and, believe me, my friend,\nIf the call should come early for me,\nI can leave these foundations uprooted, and tend\nFor some new city over the sea.\nTo do or to try; and if failure be mine,\nAnd if Fortune go cross to my plan,\nBelieve me, my friend, tho' I mourn the design\nI shall never lament for the man."}
