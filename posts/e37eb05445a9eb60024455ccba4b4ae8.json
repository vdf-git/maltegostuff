{"subject": "The Lilacs", "text": "In lonely gardens deserted-unseen-\nOh! lovely lilacs of purple and white,\nYou are dipping down through a mist of green;\nFor the morning sun's delight.\nAnd the velvet bee, all belted with black,\nDrinks deep of the wine which your flagons hold,\nClings close to your plumes while he fills his pack\nWith a load of burnished gold.\n\nYou hide the fences with blossoms of snow,\nAnd sweeten the shade of castle towers;\nOver low, grey gables you brightly blow,\nLike amethysts turned to flowers.\nThe tramp on the highway-ragged and bold-\nWears you close to his heart with jaunty air;\nYou rest in my lady's girdle of gold,\nAnd are held against her hair.\n\nIn God's own acre your tender flowers,\nBend down to the grasses and seem to sigh\nFor those who count time no more by hours-\nWhose summers have all passed by-\nBut at eventide the south wind will sing,\nLike a gentle priest who chanteth a prayer;\nAnd thy purple censers he'll set a-swing,\nTo perfume the twilight air."}
