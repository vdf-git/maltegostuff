{"subject": "Growing Attachment", "text": "With the freshness and placid sensations of morning,\nAs yet all unconscious of hope or of plan,\n(Sweet gleams through thin hazes the prospect adorning,)\n'Twas thus that our dawn of attachment began.\nIf 'twere Friendship or Love, that we knew not full surely,\nBut yet 'twas delicious to saunter along,\nNot quite quessing whither, but feeling securely,\nWith such omens around us\u2014we couldn't go wrong.\n\nWith hearts thus uncertain, (for hearts have their weather,)\nFull many a pathway we threaded, and grove;\nTill, at last, (so it fell,) we stood plighting together\nIn the precincts\u2014nay, right in the presence of Love.\nWe have plighted! And now\u2014(as yon mid-sun is beaming\nWith the hazes of morning no longer at strife)\u2014\nSo Love his meridian fervour is streaming,\nAnd quickening all round us the landscape of life.\nIf mists gather o'er, he pervades and enlightens;\nHis eyes glance a magic wherever they fall;\nA magic the Present\u2014the Future that brightens;\nThat modifies, beautifies, glorifies all.\nAnd dost Thou then sigh, his duration distrusting,\nAnd deem'st Thou such brilliancy never can last?\nThat suns shall wax fainter; that hearts will be rusting,\nAnd that lovers must weep over happiness\u2014past.\n\nWhat though glorious at mid-day the Master of Heaven,\nYet are they less dear, his slant rays, ere he part?\nAnd hath not Love too his mild glories of even,\nHis warm peaceful hues\u2014his soft skies for the heart?\nAnd such are the colours his hand shall shed over us,\nWhen youth's throbbing pulse shall to calmness give place;\nEnough that, when silence and darkness shall cover us,\nWe have felt his full flame\u2014and but die with the race.\nAnd I feel it, Belov\u00e8d!\u2014they do not deceive us,\nWho say that, hereafter, some welcoming shore\nShall to home of yet brighter existence receive us,\nTo love, as we now love, and ne'er to part more."}
