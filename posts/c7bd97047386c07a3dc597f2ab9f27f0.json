{"subject": "Ehue! Fugaces, Posthume, Labuntur Anni", "text": "Fleeting years are ever bearing\nIn their silent course away\nAll that in our pleasures sharing\nLent to life a cheering ray.\n\nBeauty's cheek but blooms to wither,\nSmiling hours but come to fly;\nThey are gone; Time's but the giver\nOf whate'er is doomed to die.\n\nThou may'st touch with blighting finger\nAll that sense can here enjoy;\nYet within my soul shall linger\nThat which thou canst not destroy.\n\nLove's sweet voice shall there awaken\nJoys that earth cannot impart;\nJoys that live when thou hast taken\nAll that here can charm the heart.\n\nAs the years come gliding by me,\nFancy's pleasing visions rise;\nBeauty's cheek, ah! still I see thee,\nStill your glances, soft blue eyes!"}
