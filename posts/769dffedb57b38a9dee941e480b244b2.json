{"subject": "Narcissus, Photographer", "text": "\"...a frozen memory, like any photo,\nwhere nothing is missing, not even,\nand especially, nothingness...\"\n-- Julio Cort\u00e1zar, \"Blow Up\"\n\nMirror-mad,\nhe photographed reflections:\nsunstorms in puddles,\ncities in canals,\n\ndouble portraits framed\nin sunglasses,\nthe fat phantoms who dance\non the flanks of cars.\n\nNothing caught his eye\nunless it bent\nor glistered\nover something else.\n\nHe trapped clouds in bottles\nthe way kids\ntrap grasshoppers.\nThen one misty day\n\nhe was stopped\nby the windshield.\nBehind him,\nan avenue of trees,\n\nbefore him,\nthe mirror of that scene.\nHe seemed to enter\nwhat, in fact, he left."}
