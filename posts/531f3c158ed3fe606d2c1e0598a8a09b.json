{"subject": "Nothing Much For Minors", "text": "Minors are those less than eighteen, \r\nAs they don't have knowledge in keen.\r\n\r\nThey don't have a driving licence,  \r\nAs don't have driving sense.\r\n\r\nMinors are given just pen and page, \r\nTheir life is not more than a cage.\r\n\r\nHoliday is not given even on sundays,\r\nAs their age is negligible for fundays.\r\n\r\nParents are worried not to get blame,\r\nFrom minors they just want their fame.\r\n\r\nCircumstances are same for every minor,\r\nParents are just their life designer."}
