{"subject": "Letters From A Father", "text": "Ulcerated tooth keeps me awake, there is\nsuch pain, would have to go to the hospital to have\nit pulled or would bleed to death from the blood thinners,\nbut can't leave Mother, she falls and forgets her salve\nand her tranquilizers, her ankles swell so and her bowels\nare so bad, she almost had a stoppage and sometimes\nwhat she passes is green as grass.There are big holes\nin my thigh where my leg brace buckles the size of dimes.\nMy head pounds from the high pressure.It is awful\nnot to be able to get out, and I fell in the bathroom\nand the girl could hardly get me up at all.\nSure thought my back was broken, it will be next time.\nProstate is bad and heart has given out,\nfeel bloated after supper. Have made my peace\nbecause am just plain done for and have no doubt\nthat the Lord will come any day with my release.\nYou say you enjoy your feeder, I don't see why\nyou want to spend good money on grain for birds\nand you say you have a hundred sparrows, I'd buy\npoison and get rid of their diseases and turds."}
