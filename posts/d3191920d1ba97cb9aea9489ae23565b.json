{"subject": "Bkii:Xviii Vain Riches", "text": "There\u2019s no ivory, there\u2019s no\ngilded panelling, gleaming here in my house,\nno beams of Hymettian\nmarble rest on pillars quarried in deepest\n\nAfrica, I\u2019ve not, as heir\nto Attalus, become unwitting owner\nof some palace, no noble\nladies trail robes of Spartan purple for me.\n\nBut I\u2019ve honour, and a vein\nof kindly wit, and though I\u2019m poor the rich man\nseeks me out: I don\u2019t demand\nanything more of the gods, or my powerful\n\nfriend, I\u2019m contented enough\nblessed with my one and only Sabine Farm.\nDay treads on the heels of day,\nand new moons still continue to wane away.\n\nYet you contract on the edge\nof the grave itself for cut marble, forget\nthe tomb and raise a palace,\npushing hard to extend the shore of Baiae\u2019s\n\nroaring seas, not rich enough\nin mainland coast. What\u2019s the point of tearing down\nevery neighbouring boundary\nedging your fields, leaping over, in your greed,\n\nthe limits of your tenants? Both the husband\nand wife, and their miserable\nchildren, are driven out, and they\u2019re left clutching\ntheir household gods to their breast.\nYet there\u2019s no royal courtyard\nthat more surely waits for a wealthy owner,\nthan greedy Orcus\u2019 fateful\nlimits. Why stretch for more? Earth\u2019s equally open\n\nto the poorest of men and\nthe sons of kings: and Orcus\u2019s ferryman\ncouldn\u2019t be seduced by gold\nto row back and return crafty Prometheus.\n\nProud Tantalus, and Pelops\nhis son, he holds fast, and whether he\u2019s summoned,\nor whether he\u2019s not, he lends\nan ear, and frees the poor man, his labours done."}
