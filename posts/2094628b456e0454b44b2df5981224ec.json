{"subject": "The Skater", "text": "My glad feet shod with the glittering steel \nI was the god of the wing\u00e8d heel. \n\nThe hills in the far white sky were lost; \nThe world lay still in the wide white frost; \n\nAnd the woods hung hushed in their long white dream \nBy the ghostly, glimmering, ice-blue stream. \n\nHere was a pathway, smooth like glass, \nWhere I and the wandering wind might pass \n\nTo the far-off palaces, drifted deep, \nWhere Winter's retinue rests in sleep. \n\nI followed the lure, I fled like a bird, \nTill the startled hollows awoke and heard \n\nA spinning whisper, a sibilant twang, \nAs the stroke of the steel on the tense ice rang; \n\nAnd the wandering wind was left behind \nAs faster, faster I followed my mind; \n\nTill the blood sang high in my eager brain, \nAnd the joy of my flight was almost pain. \n\nThe I stayed the rush of my eager speed\nAnd silently went as a drifting seed, --\n\nSlowly, furtively, till my eyes\nGrew big with the awe of a dim surmise,\n\nAnd the hair of my neck began to creep\nAt hearing the wilderness talk in sleep.\n\nShapes in the fir-gloom drifted near.\nIn the deep of my heart I heard my fear.\n\nAnd I turned and fled, like a soul pursued,\nFrom the white, inviolate solitude."}
