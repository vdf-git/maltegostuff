{"subject": "Particular Beauties", "text": "Whether it was a particular beauty\nStirred the tearfall from the eyelid's rim,\nRinsing the world once more with self,\nWas it not there the general peered,\nThousand-eyed, down from the peak\nIn the last of all imaginary sunsets?\nThe light divided in half, the half\nDivided again in half, the way\nZeno's paradox makes nothing move\nBecause an infinity of points between\nTarget and arrow, though never seen,\nExists. And there is snow in a capsule,\nA solid floor of individual\nFlakes that, shaken, settle in a field\u2014\nParachutists growing where the grass,\nOne moment before, was only natural.\nI am speaking now of the diminishment\nOr enhancement of enchanted objects,\nOf how they turn into nothingness\nOr burnish the imagination:\nA fire at the bottom of the sea,\nFor instance, or a mind in space\nThinking its way into science fiction,\nOr, inside the skull, a little world\nClinging, about to be thrown away\u2014\nMiraculous lint under a bell."}
