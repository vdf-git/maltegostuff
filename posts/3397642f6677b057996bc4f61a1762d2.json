{"subject": "Unroofed", "text": "It haunts.\nYou still want to see the\u2015\nbeheading, piecemeal\nin borderless pain.\nThe war had defrauded my life.\n\nAn unsoiled moon\nwas taking depressed steps tonight.\nFaith healing had stopped.\n\nFloaters swim again in view.\n\nA forbidden place.\nYou do not want to visit the\nBlood-soaked turf.\n\nDarkness enters\nthe poem."}
