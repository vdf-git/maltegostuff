{"subject": "It's Obvious You'Re An Ass", "text": "A face, once attractive, now damaged,\nIn your traces I encounter the death they caused you,\nIn the women you lost, whom you left, who fled from you\nIn order to survive somewhere\nOn emotional alms.\n\nA face, attractive even today, despite all the destruction, doubt, \nDecomposition,\nA body you drag around and conceal in an accursed land.\nGiant proportions and pitiful at the same time.\nA ring in your ear - something to give meaning to the absurdity.\nEvery day you gamble some of the quality of a star, you wane in the sands,\nEvery night you gain some of the immortality of death.\nOh, now that you are expiring, while you are still dying,\nYou hurl terrible tentacles of sickly silence into the air ...\nWith a flick of your whip you catch, pull in, entangle, \nSubdue,\nWith sterile lips, the senseless body.\n\nI have often encountered the traces of your dissipation, your dissolution,\nYour indirect manner of expression, of pollution,\nFurtiveness, sophistry, fickleness, inexistence,\nOf that inconstancy on which nothing can be constructed.\nLuxurious feelings, destructive in their essence,\nClaw like cats at the breasts of abandoned women.\nAn attractive soul led astray, you continue to err,\nYou know how to behave, but there is no moral in your soul.\nI am yours, you have me, as you always had,\nSupport, breath, path out of a blind alley,\nBut you don't understand because you're an ass\nAnd this is why\nI love you\nSo terribly."}
