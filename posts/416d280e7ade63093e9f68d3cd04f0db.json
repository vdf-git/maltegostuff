{"subject": "In Praise of Alcohol", "text": "In Praise of Alcohol\n\nOf vintage wine I am a lover;\nTo drink deep would be my delight;\nIf 'twere not for the bleak hangover\nI'd get me loaded every night;\nI'd whoop it up with song and laughter -\nIf 'twere not for the morning after.\nFor though to soberness I'm given\nIt is a thought I've often thunk:\nThe nearest that is Earth to Heaven\nIs to get sublimely drunk;\nIs to achieve divine elation\nBy means of generous libation.\nAlas, the wine-cups claim their payment\nAnd as the price if often pain,\nif we could sense what morning grey meant\nWe never would get soused again;\nRather than buy a hob-nailed liver\nI'm sure that we'd abstain for ever.\nYet how I love the glow of liquor,\nAs joyfully I drink it up!\nhoping that unto life's last flicker\nWith praise I'll raise the ruby cup;\nAnd let me like a jolly monk\nProceed to get sublimely drunk."}
