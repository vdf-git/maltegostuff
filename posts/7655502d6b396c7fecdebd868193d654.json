{"subject": "Symphony In Red", "text": "Within the church\nThe solemn priests advance,\nAnd the sunlight, stained by the heavy windows,\nDyes a yet richer red the scarlet banners\nAnd the scarlet robes of the young boys that bear them,\nAnd the thoughts of one of these are far away,\nWith carmined lips pouting an invitation,\nAre with his love - his love, like a crimson poppy\nFlaunting amid prim lupins;\nAnd his ears hear nought of the words sung from the rubricked book,\nAnd his heart is hot as the red sun."}
