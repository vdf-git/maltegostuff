{"subject": "A Wedding", "text": "She was in terrible pain the whole day,\nas she had been for months: a slipped disc,   \nand there is nothing more painful. She\n\nherself was a nurse's aide, also a poet   \njust beginning to make a name for her   \nnom de plume. As with most things in life,\n\nit happened when she was changing channels   \non her television. The lucky man, on the other   \nhand, was smiling for the first time\n\nin his life, and it was fake. He was\nan aspiring philosopher of dubious potential,   \nvery serious, but somehow lacking in\n\nessential depth. He could have been\nan adequate undertaker. It was not the first   \ntime for either of them. It was a civil\n\nservice, with no music, few flowers.   \nStill, there was a slow and erratic tide\nof champagne\u2014corks shot clear into the trees.\n\nAnd flashcubes, instant photos, some blurred   \nand some too revealing, cake slices that aren't   \nwhat they were meant to be. The bride slept\n\nthrough much of it, and never did we figure out   \nwho was on whose team. I think the groom   \nmeant it in the end when he said, \"We never\n\nthought anyone would come.\" We were not the first   \nto arrive, nor the last to leave. Who knows,   \nit may all turn out for the best. And who\n\nreally cares about such special days, they   \nare not what we live for."}
