{"subject": "To J.R.", "text": "Last Sunday night I read the saddening story\nOf the unanswered love of fair Elaine,\nThe 'faith unfaithful' and the joyless glory\nOf Lancelot, 'groaning in remorseful pain.'\n\nI thought of all those nights in wintry weather,\nThose Sunday nights that seem not long ago,\nWhen we two read our Poet's words together,\nTill summer warmth within our hearts did glow.\n\nAh, when shall we renew that bygone pleasure,\nSit down together at our Merlin's feet,\nDrink from one cup the overflowing measure,\nAnd find, in sharing it, the draught more sweet?\n\nThat time perchance is far, beyond divining.\nTill then we drain the 'magic cup' apart;\nYet not apart, for hope and memory twining\nSmile upon each, uniting heart to heart."}
