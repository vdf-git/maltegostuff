{"subject": "The Chrism Of Kings", "text": "IN the morn of the world, at the day break of time,\n  When kingdoms were few and empires unknown,\nGod searched for a Ruler to sceptre the land,\n  And gather the harvest from the seed He had sown.\nHe found a young shepherd boy watching his flock\n  Where the mountains looked down on deep meadows of green; \nHe hailed the young shepherd boy king of the land\n  And anointed his brow with a Chrism unseen.\n\nHe placed in his frail hands the sceptre of power,\n  And taught his young heart all the wisdom of love; \nHe gave him the vision of prophet and priest,\n  And dowered him with counsel and light from above.\nBut alas! came a day when the shepherd forgot\n  And heaped on his realm all the woes that war brings,\nAnd bartering his purple for the greed of his heart\n  He lost both the sceptre and Chrism of Kings."}
