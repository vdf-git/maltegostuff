{"subject": "Once Upon A Time", "text": "Not only echoes from the past\nTalk to us in that tender phrase;\nIt rings upon our hearts at last,\nA watchword for the coming days:\nWhen, having reached those heights of rest,\nWe point to where we stood below;\nAnd how we scaled each tedious crest,\nWith hopes how faint, and steps how slow!\nHow once we shrank from toils which prove\nThe test and triumph of our might;\nAnd once we basely doubted Love,\nWhich now surrounds us with its light.\nO! that we could this hour begin\nThe lesson of our evening time,\nAnd say to parting, pain, and sin,\n\u201cWe knew you\u2014once upon a time!\u201d"}
