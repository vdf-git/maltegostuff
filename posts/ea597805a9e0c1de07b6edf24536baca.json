{"subject": "Martin", "text": "When I am tired of earnest men,\n Intense and keen and sharp and clever,\nPursuing fame with brush or pen\n Or counting metal disks forever,\nThen from the halls of Shadowland\n Beyond the trackless purple sea\nOld Martin's ghost comes back to stand\n Beside my desk and talk to me. \n\nStill on his delicate pale face\n A quizzical thin smile is showing,\nHis cheeks are wrinkled like fine lace,\n His kind blue eyes are gay and glowing.\nHe wears a brilliant-hued cravat,\n A suit to match his soft grey hair,\nA rakish stick, a knowing hat,\n A manner blithe and debonair. \n\nHow good that he who always knew\n That being lovely was a duty,\nShould have gold halls to wander through\n And should himself inhabit beauty.\nHow like his old unselfish way\n To leave those halls of splendid mirth\nAnd comfort those condemned to stay\n Upon the dull and sombre earth. \n\nSome people ask: \"What cruel chance\n Made Martin's life so sad a story?\"\nMartin? Why, he exhaled romance,\n And wore an overcoat of glory.\nA fleck of sunlight in the street,\n A horse, a book, a girl who smiled,\nSuch visions made each moment sweet\n For this receptive ancient child. \n\nBecause it was old Martin's lot\n To be, not make, a decoration,\nShall we then scorn him, having not\n His genius of appreciation?\nRich joy and love he got and gave;\n His heart was merry as his dress;\nPile laurel wreaths upon his grave\n Who did not gain, but was, success!"}
