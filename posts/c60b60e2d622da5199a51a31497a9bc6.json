{"subject": "The Song of the Camp", "text": "\"GIVE us a song!\" the soldiers cried, \nThe outer trenches guarding, \nWhen the heated guns of the camps allied \nGrew weary of bombarding. \n\nThe dark Redan, in silent scoff,\nLay, grim and threatening, under; \nAnd the tawny mound of the Malakoff \nNo longer belched its thunder. \n\nThere was a pause. A guardsman said,\n\"We storm the forts to-morrow;\nSing while we may, another day \nWill bring enough of sorrow.\" \n\nThey lay along the battery's side, \nBelow the smoking cannon: \nBrave hearts, from Severn and from Clyde,\nAnd from the banks of Shannon. \n\nThey sang of love, and not of fame; \nForgot was Britain's glory: \nEach heart recalled a different name, \nBut all sang \"Annie Laurie.\"\n\nVoice after voice caught up the song, \nUntil its tender passion \nRose like an anthem, rich and strong,\u2014 \nTheir battle-eve confession. \n\nDear girl, her name he dared not speak,\nBut, as the song grew louder, \nSomething upon the soldier's cheek \nWashed off the stains of powder. \n\nBeyond the darkening ocean burned \nThe bloody sunset's embers,\nWhile the Crimean valleys learned \nHow English love remembers. \n\nAnd once again a fire of hell \nRained on the Russian quarters, \nWith scream of shot, and burst of shell,\nAnd bellowing of the mortars! \n\nAnd Irish Nora's eyes are dim \nFor a singer, dumb and gory; \nAnd English Mary mourns for him \nWho sang of \"Annie Laurie.\"\n\nSleep, soldiers! still in honored rest \nYour truth and valor wearing: \nThe bravest are the tenderest,\u2014 \nThe loving are the daring."}
