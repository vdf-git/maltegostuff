{"subject": "Sonnet Lxiv:", "text": "LXIV\n\nRoll the grand harmonies which finite mind \nCan neither reason of nor understand, \nThou instrument, on which a higher hand \nPlays the vast prelude that had strength to bind \nThe circling stars, the ocean and the wind, \nWhen the creative spirit's first command \nMoved on through heaven and over sea and land \nAs earth emerged from chaos blank and blind! \nO humble creature, burn not to aspire, \nBut lowly to the hidden law incline; \nAnd of thy duty neither stint nore tire. \nFulfill thy mission to thy Lord's design; \nMake glad the common way and household fire: \nA higher lot hereafter may be thine."}
