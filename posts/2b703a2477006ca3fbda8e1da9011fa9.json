{"subject": "Flowers Of Love", "text": "Oh the flowers of love, \nBlooming everyday\nAnd teasing him everynight\nIn the garden of desire, \nDo you have no fright \nThat someday his faith could become so gray? \n\nHere love wishes to stay, \nHere love always wants to play. \nSee the perfect pair\nWeaning like an infant aged just one year, \nPertaining the fame filled \nWith a poetic spear, \nAnd with a strong breath, \ncan easily strike heard \nIn the heart of a garrulous faith.\n\nOh the flowers of love, \nDo you feel the joy \nFor which you always acclaim? \nCan you easily tame \nA thoughtless wanderer's way? \nWill he be besotted in rapture\nWith your fascinating fragnance? \nIn that arid heart love can play? \n\nLook, may he be a thoughtless man, \nMay he be a wanderer travelled a long way, \nBut he is wide-awake yet, \nPoetic mood sometimes might be embellished; \nLove pours some gleeful sense in that vacant heart\nWhile he walks through a warm desert.\nLove will rule his heart and will always stay! \nSays that the flowers of love."}
