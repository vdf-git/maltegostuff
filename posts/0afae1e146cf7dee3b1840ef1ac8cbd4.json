{"subject": "Madeline Bower", "text": "She perished in beauty, \nAs withers a rose \nWhen its delicate petals \nBegin to unclose. \nShe passed from among us, \nAnd left us to pine \nFor the treasure we could not \nWith calmness resign. \nThe light of our home \nHas grown dim since the hour \nIt lost the dear presence \nOf Madeline Bower. \n\nHer voice was like music \nThat trembles along, \nWhen the last strain is sung \nOf a soul-thrilling song. \nSo witchingly mellow, \nYou'd stand by her side, \nAnd drink in its echo \nLong after it died. \nNow vainly we list \nAt the still, twilight hour \nFor the notes of our song-bird\u2014\nLost Madeline Bower. \n\nHer tresses of light \nSeemed o'er marble to flow, \nFor her brow could have rivaled \nThe purest of snow. \nAh ! none but bereaved ones, \nWho've wept o'er the clay, \nCan know of our pangs \nWhen 'twas hidden away. \nOne tress from its sisters \nWas severed that hour : \n'Twas all we might claim \nOf sweet Madeline Bower. \n\nOh, would they could waft us\u2014\nOur treasures above\u2014\nSome tender remembrance, \nSome token of love,\u2014\nA mystical sign \nThat they do not forget ; \nA blessed assurance \nThey yearn for us yet ! \n\nOr is it designed \nThat we hear not nor see \nOne trace of our loved ones \nTill death sets us free ? \nDo we pass through the vale, \nWith its shadow and blight, \nThat the glory of heaven \nMay burst on our sight ? \nIf so, how ecstatic, \nHow rapturous the hour \nOur freed souls are welcomed \nBy Madeline Bower !"}
