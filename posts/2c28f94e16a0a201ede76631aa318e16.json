{"subject": "First Love", "text": "Falling in love was like falling down the stairs\nEach stair had her name on it\nAnd he went bouncing down each one like a tongue-tied\nlunatic\nOne day of loving her was an ordinary year\nHe transformed her into what he wanted\nAnd the scent from her\nWas the best scent in the world\nFifteen he was fifteen\nEach night he dreamed of her\nEach day he telephoned her\nEach day was unfamiliar\nScary even\nAnd the fear of her going weighed on him like a stone\nAnd when he could not see her for two nights running\nIt seemed a century had passed\nAnd meeting her and staring at her face\nHe knew he would feel as he did forever\nHopelessly in love\nSick with it\nAnd not even knowing her second name yet\nIt was the first time\nThe best time\nA time that would last forever\nBecause it was new\nBecause he was ignorant it could ever end\nIt was endless"}
