{"subject": "Location", "text": "We live in a city without a river, there are\nborders here made only of wind\nor rainshowers. At night\nthis frightens my sister, but in our house\nthere is no weeping, perhaps\nit would help her, perhaps it would drive her\nover the edge. It is frosty\nin her voice. If distances could be described\nwithout rivers, at least the ideas\nwould be sustainable: No one\ncomes near our house and we haven't\nseen our parents for years. \nBut there is no rest, this city is\nlike remaindered snow in March. Only the wind,\nwhich drives the rain into its shape,\nhints at a city limit. Our house remains\nlocked in ice and vanished.\n\nTranslated by Donna Stonecipher"}
