{"subject": "Sonnet Xlvi.", "text": "Written at Penhurst, in Autumn 1788. \nYE towers sublime! deserted now and drear!\nYe woods! deep sighing to the hollow blast,\nThe musing wanderer loves to linger near,\nWhile History points to all your glories past:\nAnd startling from their haunts the timid deer,\nTo trace the walks obscured by matted fern,\nWhich Waller's soothing lyre were wont to hear,\nBut where now clamours the discordant hern!\nThe spoiling hand of Time may overturn\nThese lofty battlements, and quite deface\nThe fading canvass whence we love to learn\nSydney's keen look, and Sacharissa's grace;\nBut fame and beauty still defy decay,\nSaved by the historic page--the poet's tender lay!"}
