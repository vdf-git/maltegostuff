{"subject": "To The Adriatic", "text": "I have beheld you, Adriatic, I have beheld you,\nA nymph from the twinkling heavens\nSparkling with pearls, your breasts\nHeaving gracefully like a sylph's.\nI knelt before you as before a goddess,\nAn apparition of untold beauty.\nThe rapture I felt, I could not endure,\nAnd departed, tears streaming down my cheeks.\nLike molten gold you shimmer,\nA fabled palace full of magic,\nYou sway like maidens in the meadow.\nOf youthful grace is your rise and fall,\nSweet memories, a world of wonder\nLike a vision of divinity itself."}
