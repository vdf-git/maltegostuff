{"subject": "Holy Russia", "text": "The world shall be made new\nSince thou hast found thy soul.\nThere shall be freedom for the Jew\nAnd justice for the Pole.\nFinland's chain shall break\nAs breaks the ice in spring,\nAnd spirits like the birds awake\nThat were too sad to sing.\n\nThroughout the troubled earth\nProphetic tremors run --\nIt is the travail of the birth\nOf Freedom's youngest son.\nDreams that have been as dead\nRise glorious from their grave\nAs throb to a deliverer's tread\nThe pulses of the slave.\n\nTorch of the Holy Fires,\nLead us along thy way\nUp to the vision of our sires\nThat we have cloaked with clay!\nHumbly we yield to thee\nThe glory of the van.\nLead on, where calls through liberty\nThe brotherhood of man!"}
