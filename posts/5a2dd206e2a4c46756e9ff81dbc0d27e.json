{"subject": "Bigotry's Victim", "text": "I.\nDares the lama, most fleet of the sons of the wind,\nThe lion to rouse from his skull-covered lair?\nWhen the tiger approaches can the fast-fleeting hind\nRepose trust in his footsteps of air?\nNo! Abandoned he sinks in a trance of despair,\nThe monster transfixes his prey,\nOn the sand flows his life-blood away;\nWhilst India's rocks to his death-yells reply,\nProtracting the horrible harmony.\n\nII.\nYet the fowl of the desert, when danger encroaches,\nDares fearless to perish defending her brood,\nThough the fiercest of cloud-piercing tyrants approaches\nThirsting--ay, thirsting for blood;\nAnd demands, like mankind, his brother for food;\nYet more lenient, more gentle than they; \nFor hunger, not glory, the prey\nMust perish. Revenge does not howl in the dead.\nNor ambition with fame crown the murderer\u2019s head.\n\nIII.\nThough weak as the lama that bounds on the mountains,\nAnd endued not with fast-fleeting footsteps of air, \nYet, yet will I draw from the purest of fountains,\nThough a fiercer than tiger is there.\nThough, more dreadful than death, it scatters despair,\nThough its shadow eclipses the day,\nAnd the darkness of deepest dismay \nSpreads the influence of soul-chilling terror around,\nAnd lowers on the corpses, that rot on the ground.\n\nIV.\nThey came to the fountain to draw from its stream\nWaves too pure, too celestial, for mortals to see;\nThey bathed for awhile in its silvery beam,\nThen perished, and perished like me.\nFor in vain from the grasp of the Bigot I flee;\nThe most tenderly loved of my soul\nAre slaves to his hated control.\nHe pursues me, he blasts me! 'Tis in vain that I fly:--\nWhat remains, but to curse him,--to curse him and die?"}
