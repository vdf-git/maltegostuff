{"subject": "O Saffron Flower! Sitting In Silent Meditation", "text": "O saffron flower! sitting in silent meditation\nAnd radiating the fire of youth,\nMany a famed beauty swoons\nSeeing your amazing, flaming form.\n\nAll guts have run away,\nLeaving the field for you,\nLike the stars hide themselves\nWhen the sun ascends the heavens.\n\nYou were the last to arrive,\nBut proved the lord of all.\nAll lovers of flowers have arrived\nTo pay their homage to you.\n\nO saffron flower, have you ever\nThought of the plight of one\nWho nursed you, made you bloom,\nAnd has been your friend in need? \n\nHe guarded you on every front,\nUndeterred by the blazing sun,\nSaw that no animal, big or small,\nEver harmed your steady growth.\n\nRight from his birth till now,\nHe has been your devoted vassal,\nThough he stands worn out, his face\nDark, disfigured, patched and peeled.\n\nSorrows have given him pallor,\nDust covers his slender frame.\nCouldn't you, in kindness, spare for him\nA little of your rosy hue? \n\nYou'll soon be moving all over the world; \nBut how on earth could you\nForget your dearest friend,\nNow grovelling in the dust? \n\nMahjoor, why came you so early? \nYou could have delayed your arrival,\nSo that people could flock to buy you,\nLike they buy saffron flowers."}
