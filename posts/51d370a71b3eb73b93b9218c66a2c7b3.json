{"subject": "A Man Young And Old: Iv. The Death Of The Hare", "text": "I have pointed out the yelling pack,\nThe hare leap to the wood,\nAnd when I pass a compliment\nRejoice as lover should\nAt the drooping of an eye,\nAt the mantling of the blood.\n\nThen suddenly my heart is wrung\nBy her distracted air\nAnd I remember wildness lost\nAnd after, swept from there,\nAm set down standing in the wood\nAt the death of the hare."}
