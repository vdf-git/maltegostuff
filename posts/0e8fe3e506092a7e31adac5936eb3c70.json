{"subject": "Nightfall In The City Of Hyderabad", "text": "SEE how the speckled sky burns like a pigeon's throat, \nJewelled with embers of opal and peridote. \nSee the white river that flashes and scintillates, \nCurved like a tusk from the mouth of the city-gates. \nHark, from the minaret, how the muezzin's call \nFloats like a battle-flag over the city wall. \nFrom trellised balconies, languid and luminous \nFaces gleam, veiled in a splendour voluminous. \nLeisurely elephants wind through the winding lanes, \nSwinging their silver bells hung from their silver chains. \nRound the high Char Minar sounds of gay cavalcades \nBlend with the music of cymbals and serenades. \nOver the city bridge Night comes majestical, \nBorne like a queen to a sumptuous festival."}
