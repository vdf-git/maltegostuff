{"subject": "Haunted Seas", "text": "A gleaming glassy ocean \n  Under a sky of grey; \nA tide that dreams of motion, \n  Or moves, as the dead may; \nA bird that dips and wavers \n  Over lone waters round, \nThen with a cry that quavers \n  Is gone\u2014a spectral sound.\n\nThe brown sad sea-weed drifting \n  Far from the land, and lost; \nThe faint warm fog unlifting, \n  The derelict long tossed, \nBut now at rest\u2014though haunted \n  By the death-scenting shark, \nWhose prey no more undaunted \n  Slips from it, spent and stark."}
