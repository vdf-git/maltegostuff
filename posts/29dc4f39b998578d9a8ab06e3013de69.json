{"subject": "Variation On A Theme", "text": "June 30th, 1919\n\nNotably fond of music, I dote on a \nclearer tone \nThan ever was blared by a bugle or zoomed \nby a saxophone; \nAnd the sound that opens the gates for me of \na Paradise revealed \nIs something akin to the note revered by the \nbless\u00e9d Eugene Field, \nWho sang in pellucid phrasing that I perfectly \nwill recall \nOf the clink of the ice in the pitcher that the \nboy brings up the hall. \nBut sweeter to me than the sparrow's song or \nthe goose's autumn honks \nIs the sound of the ice in the shaker as the \nbarkeeper mixes a Bronx.\n\nBetween the dark and the daylight, when I'm \nworried about The Tower, \nComes a pause in the day's tribulations that \nis known as the cocktail hour; \nAnd my soul is sad and jaded, and my heart \nis a thing forlorn, \nAnd I view the things I have written with a \nsickening, scathing scorn. \nOh, it's then I fare with some other slave who \nis hired for the things he writes \nTo a Den of Sin where they mingle gin--such \nas Lipton's, Mouquin's or Whyte's, \nAnd my spirit thrills to a music sweeter than \nSullivan or Puccini-- \nThe swash of the ice in the shaker as he mixes \na Dry martini.\n\nThe drys will assert that metallic sound is the \nselfsame canon made \nBy the ice in a shaker that holds a drink \nlike orange or lemonade; \nBut on the word of a traveled man and a \nbard who has been around, \nThe sound of tin on ice and gin is a snappier, \nhappier sound. \nAnd I mean to hymn, as soon as I have a \nmoment of leisure time, \nThe chill susurrus of cocktail ice in an adequae \npiece of rhyme. \nBut I've just had an invitation to hark, at a \nbeckoning bar, \nTo the sound of the ice in the shaker as the \nbarkeeper mixes a Star."}
