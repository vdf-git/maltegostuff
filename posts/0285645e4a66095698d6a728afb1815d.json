{"subject": "Nymph And Zephyr: A Statuary Group. By Westmacott", "text": "AND the summer sun shone in the sky,\nAnd the rose's whole life was in its sigh,\nWhen her eyelids were kiss'd by a morning beam,\nAnd the Nymph rose up from her moonlit dream;\nFor she had watch'd the midnight hour\nTill her head had bow'd like a sleeping flower;\nBut now she had waken'd, and light and dew\nGave her morning freshness and morning hue,--\nUp she sprang, and away she fled\nO'er the lithe grass stem and the blossom's head,\nFrom the lillies' bells she dash'd not the spray,\nFor her feet were as light and as white as they.\nSudden upon her arm there shone\nA gem with the hues of an Indian stone,\nAnd she knew the insect bird whose wing\nIs sacred to PSYCHE and to spring;\nBut scarce had her touch its captive prest\nEre another prisoner was on her breast,\nAnd the Zephyr sought his prize again,--\n'No,' said the Nymph, thy search is vain:\nAnd her golden hair from its braided yoke\nBurst like the banner of hope as she spoke,\n'And instead, fair boy, thou shalt moralize\nOver the pleasure that from thee flies;\nThen it is pleasure,--for we possess\nBut in the search, not in the success.'"}
