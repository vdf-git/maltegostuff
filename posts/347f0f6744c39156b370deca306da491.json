{"subject": "Love In Carlisle", "text": "Girls were crying yesterday in their ball gowns; \nHolding each other up like poles of wilted beanstalks. \nI wanted to carry them into the streets. \nTo the unused railroad track in the middle of town, \nUnwrap the past and lay before them \nA fragile girl I once knew, walking toward love \nIn a thin, determined way. That she should live here too \u2014 \nIn this town of carefully-guarded houses \nAnd old ladies in rocking chairs \nIn fake pearls and printed button-down dresses.\n\nGirls are crying in their ball gowns and boys \nAre holding them up and taking them to the streets, \nTo warehouses or backs of deserted pick-up trucks. \nA troubadour waits on a wooden porch \nFor the faultless girl, to speak her name, \nUndress her, give noise to her that is new and violent. \nThe old ladies form a line and hold photographs \nAgainst their faces where the skin used to be unbroken. \nThey step out from their dresses and kick off their shoes, \nCross over the barren tracks in their solitary dance."}
