{"subject": "Hymn Of The New World", "text": "A star a star in the west!\nOut of the wave it rose:\nAnd it led us forth on a world-far quest;\nWhere the mesas scorched and the moorlands froze.\nIt lured us without rest:\nWith yearning, yearning\u2014ah!\nIt sang (as it beckoned us) \nA music vast, adventurous-\nAmerica!\n\nA star a star in the night!\nOut of our hearts it dawned !\nAnd it poured within its wonderful light;\nWhere our hovels gloomed and our hunger spawned\nIt healed our passionate blight:\nAnd burning, burning\u2014ah!\nIt clanged (as it kindled us)\nOf a freedom proud and perilous-\nAmerica!\n\nA star\u2014a star in the dawn!\nBright from God s brow it gleams!\nLike a morning star in ages gone\nWith hallowed song its holy beams\nUrge us forever on:\nFor chanting, chanting\u2014ah!\nIt builds (as it blesses us) \nA union strong, harmonious-\nAmerica !"}
