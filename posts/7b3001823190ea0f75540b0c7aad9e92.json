{"subject": "When You Peel The Moon", "text": "Turgid freedom of nondescript \nenergy moves on the\nsecret circuits of nude gods. \nThy body politic breaks into splinters of million thoughts. \nWhen the dusty  winds \nsettle on our faces, it is a holy bath. \nThe neutral sky perceives it, \nlapses into silence.\n\nPoor vision of builders, \ncarries an abstract frame for the silver screen. \nWe peer in dark \nto find the blasts, \nculture of giant legs was the essence of truth \ndescends deep in crevices. \nThe technique brings the broken images.\n\nIn your mind lies the whole history of a tree.\nYou don\u2019t remember. \nWhen you peel the moon, \nyour tongue falters. \nOf several centuries \nthe grief stricken bird recites a poem. \nCome beside me, \nI will tell you the name."}
