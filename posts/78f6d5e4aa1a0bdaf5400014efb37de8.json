{"subject": "How Proud . . . !", "text": "(To the Luftwaffe)\nHow proud you must be, boys, you who were Lords of the Air,\nPlaying with fireworks, deep in a concrete cave.\nPressing a button and killing you know not where,\nYou who were going to teach us the ways of the brave!\n\nHow proud you must be, boys, hearing the soldiers cry\n'Come to our aid, Luftwaffe!' How proud you must be,\nAnswering 'Soldier, we have no time to fly:\nWe are shooting from holes at hospitals over the sea.'\n\nHow proud you will be, boys, hearing the children say\n'How did you march against England? Tell us the tale.'\n'I hid in a hole, child, many a mile away.\nAiming at Portsmouth and hitting the Maida Vale.'\nJuly 9,1944"}
