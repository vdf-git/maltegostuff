{"subject": "Brave Shadows", "text": "Circle round. Circle round.\n Silhouette by the fire.\n rings of hoops and tomahawks\n Brave shadows reaching higher\n Circle round. Circle round.\n So much was taken. Shame not spoken\n Past times forgotten Never replace respect\n What was forsaken mother earth, she too regrets\n Man's disregard for something sacred."}
