{"subject": "Sonnet I: Favour'D By Heav'N", "text": "Favour'd by Heav'n are those, ordain'd to taste\nThe bliss supreme that kindles fancy's fire;\nWhose magic fingers sweep the muses' lyre,\nIn varying cadence, eloquently chaste!\nWell may the mind, with tuneful numbers grac'd,\nTo Fame's immortal attributes aspire,\nAbove the treach'rous spells of low desire,\nThat wound the sense, by vulgar joys debas'd.\nFor thou, blest POESY! with godlike pow'rs\nTo calm the miseries of man wert giv'n;\nWhen passion rends, and hopeless love devours,\nBy mem'ry goaded, and by frenzy driv'n,\n'Tis thine to guide him 'midst Elysian bow'rs,\nAnd shew his fainting soul,--a glimpse of Heav'n."}
