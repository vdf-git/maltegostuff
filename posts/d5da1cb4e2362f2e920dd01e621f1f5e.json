{"subject": "The Sick", "text": "Evening and grief and lamp light\nBury our death-face.\n\nWe sit at the window and drop out of it,\nFar off day still squints at a gray house.\nWe scarcely touch our life...\nAnd the world is a morphine dream...\nBlinded by clouds the sky sinks.\nThe garden expires in dark wind--\nThe watchmen enter,\nLift us up into bed,\nInject us with poison,\nKill the lamp.\nCurtains hang in front of the night...\nThey disappear gently and slowly--\nSome groan, but no one speaks,\nOur buried face sleeps."}
