{"subject": "The Addict", "text": "Sleepmonger,\ndeathmonger,\nwith capsules in my palms each night,\neight at a time from sweet pharmaceutical bottles\nI make arrangements for a pint-sized journey.\nI'm the queen of this condition.\nI'm an expert on making the trip\nand now they say I'm an addict.\nNow they ask why.\nWHY!\n\nDon't they know that I promised to die!\nI'm keping in practice.\nI'm merely staying in shape.\nThe pills are a mother, but better,\nevery color and as good as sour balls.\nI'm on a diet from death.\n\nYes, I admit\nit has gotten to be a bit of a habit-\nblows eight at a time, socked in the eye,\nhauled away by the pink, the orange,\nthe green and the white goodnights.\nI'm becoming something of a chemical\nmixture.\nthat's it!\n\nMy supply\nof tablets\nhas got to last for years and years.\nI like them more than I like me.\nIt's a kind of marriage.\nIt's a kind of war where I plant bombs inside\nof myself.\n\nYes\nI try\nto kill myself in small amounts,\nan innocuous occupatin.\nActually I'm hung up on it.\nBut remember I don't make too much noise.\nAnd frankly no one has to lug me out\nand I don't stand there in my winding sheet.\nI'm a little buttercup in my yellow nightie\neating my eight loaves in a row\nand in a certain order as in\nthe laying on of hands\nor the black sacrament.\n\nIt's a ceremony\nbut like any other sport\nit's full of rules.\nIt's like a musical tennis match where\nmy mouth keeps catching the ball.\nThen I lie on; my altar\nelevated by the eight chemical kisses.\n\nWhat a lay me down this is\nwith two pink, two orange,\ntwo green, two white goodnights.\nFee-fi-fo-fum-\nNow I'm borrowed.\nNow I'm numb."}
