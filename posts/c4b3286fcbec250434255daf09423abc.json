{"subject": "Hand And Hand", "text": "Watch as they walk hand and hand,\n Across this beautiful land.\n It's plain to me, as you can see,\n To her heart he holds the key.\n She has a special gleam in her eye,\n For this one special certain guy.\n I hope their love forever endures,\n That is for darn well sure.\n You can see their bright smiles,\n That goes on for miles and miles.\n I love to watch them on their walk,\n They seem to talk and talk.\n It really reminds me of us,\n Before all this big fuss.\n If we could be young again,\n And be back to close friends.\n I want to say I love you,\n And I'll always be true.\n So please take my hand in your hand,\n And we'll walk this beautiful land."}
