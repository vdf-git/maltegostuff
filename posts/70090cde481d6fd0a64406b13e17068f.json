{"subject": "Insult The Death", "text": "Blows had blackened the mist, \nfear of crossing the road, dented the veil.\n\u2018Ism\u2019 versus the boundary had a long rhetoric.\nI was struggling with scars of learning.\nPain unwrapped the gift of rhythm with confession\nbitten by skorpios, blue and cold.\n\nFinding the cause does not solve the rigidity.\nEntering my own genome, increases the panic attack, \nwhere I am heading after all? \nAnd  today sun beats the unentered thighs \n marrow, blood of a martyr, who pledged\nto die to himself between enquiry and truth.\n\nFragmented self now seeks totality\nand the mystery of staying alive, \nwhen the hills are dead and green had turned around.\nAs usual I am meditating, to live or not to live.\nThe greatness of earth still impresses, \nit does not insult the death."}
