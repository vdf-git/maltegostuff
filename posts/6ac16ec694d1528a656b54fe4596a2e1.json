{"subject": "A Different Hunger", "text": "My bewitching creature, having seduced me with your forbidden delicacies. Feeding off my want for you, need for you and dare I say love for you.  Under a crimson moon you take me and we surrender to the night.\n\nI quiver with desire, gorging on it. Your body coils around mine so tightly that I can barely breath. Gentle fangs pierce my milky skin, leaving the mark of your sweet snake bite. My lips are left swollen and tender from the sting of your kiss.\n\nIt is your venom that flows through these veins, filling me with the warmth of your heart. If I think it is, your heart that softly calls my name, paralyzing me with pleasant fear. I drink your heavenly poison, every last drop. So that I may have part of you in me even when you are away.\n\nOh, but will you be away? After you've drained me and have nothing more to take. Will you leave me hungry, craving your existence?"}
