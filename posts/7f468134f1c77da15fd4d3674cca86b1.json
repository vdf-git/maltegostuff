{"subject": "February", "text": "Gossamer-frail, the moon\nGoes down the skies of days;\nVague winds are on the noon,\nBlown from the wandering vales\nof cloudland far away.\n\nThey come, and hardly stir\nThe dell-grown grasses high;\nBut in the pine and fir,\nAs in my musing heart,\nI hear a tender sigh.\n\nFragile as dreams, afloat\nBetween the earth and skies,\nBeyond serene, remote,\nBlue-folded hills the fair\nAnd moon-white mountains rise.\n\nIn woodland shadows deep\nThe firstling flowers blow;\nAnd in my heart I keep\nA love that also came\nAfter the frost and snow."}
