{"subject": "Poet", "text": "I am the poet, the one who writes and thinks as well. \n The one who contemplates heaven and hell.\n The one who seeks the depth of the soul.\n The one who lifts man's spirits from their holes.\n I am the poet, listen and see, for my words\n shall truly set you free.\n I am the one who will nourish your heart,\n challenge your brain, and give your spirit a start.\n I am the one you seek in your hour of need,\n when western values center on greed.\n I am the one you want to hear when the body is weary\n of food, sex, and beer.\n I am the one you turn to in doubt.\n When you ask, \"Is there a God?\"\n My words seek him out.\n I am the poet for better or worse.\n I set the mind, body, and spirit free through\n wit, rhyme, and verse."}
