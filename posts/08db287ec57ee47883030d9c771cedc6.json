{"subject": "September", "text": "The bubbled blue of morning-glory spires,\nBalloon-blown foam of moonflowers, and sweet snows\nOf clematis, through which September goes,\nSong-hearted, rich in realized desires,\nAre flanked by hotter hues: by tawny fires\nOf acrid marigolds, that light long rows\nOf lamps, and salvias, red as day's red close,\nThat torches seem by which the Month attires\nBarbaric beauty; like some Asian queen,\nTowering imperial in her two-fold crown\nOf harvest and of vintage; all her form\nMajestic gold and purple: in her mien\nThe might of motherhood; her baby brown,\nAbundance, high on one exultant arm."}
