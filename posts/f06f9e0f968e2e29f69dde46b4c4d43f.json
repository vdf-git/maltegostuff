{"subject": "Internal Firesides", "text": "Bewilderingly, from wildly shaken cloud, \nInvisible hands, deft moving everywhere, \nHave woven a winding sheet of velvet air, \nAnd laid the dead earth in her downy shroud. \nAnd more and more, in white confusion, crowd \nWan, whirling flakes, while o'er the icy glare \nBlue heaven that was glooms blackening o'er the bare \nTree skeletons, to ruthless tempest bowed. \n\nNay, let the outer world be winter-locked; \nBeside the hearth of glowing memories \nI warm my life. Once more our boat is rocked, \nAs on a cradle by the palm-fringed Nile; \nAnd, sharp-cut silhouettes, in single file, \nLank camels lounge against transparent skies."}
