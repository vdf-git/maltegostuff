{"subject": "Three Flower Petals", "text": "When saw I yesterday walking apart\nIn a leafy place where the cattle wait?\nSomething to keep for a charm in my heart-\nA little sweet girl in a garden gate.\nLaughing she lay in the gold sun's might,\nAnd held for a target to shelter her,\nIn her little soft fingers, round and white,\nThe gold-rimmed face of a sunflower.\n\nLaughing she lay on the stone that stands\nFor a rough-hewn step in that sunny place,\nAnd her yellow hair hung down to her hands,\nShadowing over her dimpled face.\nHer eyes like the blue of the sky, made dim\nWith the might of the sun that looked at her,\nShone laughing over the serried rim,\nGolden set, of the sunflower.\n\nLaughing, for token she gave to me\nThree petals out of the sunflower;-\nWhen the petals are withered and gone, shall be\nThree verses of mine for praise of her,\nThat a tender dream of her face may rise\nAnd lighten me yet in another hour,\nOf her sunny hair and her beautiful eyes,\nLaughing over the golden sunflower."}
