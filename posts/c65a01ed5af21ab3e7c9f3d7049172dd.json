{"subject": "Tell Summer That I Died", "text": "When he was old and thin\nAnd knew not night or day\nHe would sit up to say\nSomething of the fire within.\nHow woefully his chin\nMoved so slowly as he tried\nSome lusty word to say:\nTell Summer that I died.\n\nWhen gladness sweeps the land,\nAnd to the white sky\nCool butterflies go by,\nAnd sheep in shadow stand;\nWhen Love, the old command,\nTurns every hate aside,\nIn the unstinted days\nTell Summer that I died."}
