{"subject": "Introductory Verses", "text": "OH! blest art thou, whose steps may rove\nThrough the green paths of vale and grove,\nOr, leaving all their charms below, \nClimb the wild mountain's airy brow; \n\nAnd gaze afar o'er cultured plains, \nAnd cities with their stately fanes, \nAnd forests, that beneath thee lie, \nAnd ocean mingling with the sky. \n\nFor man can show thee nought so fair, \nAs Nature's varied marvels there; \nAnd if thy pure and artless breast\nCan feel their grandeur, thou art blest! \n\nFor thee the stream in beauty flows, \nFor thee the gale of summer blows,\nAnd, in deep glen and wood-walk free, \nVoices of joy still breathe for thee. \n\nBut happier far, if then thy soul\nCan soar to Him who made the whole,\nIf to thine eye the simplest flower\nPortray His bounty and His power. \n\nIf, in whate'er is bright or grand, \nThy mind can trace His viewless hand, \nIf Nature's music bid thee raise\nThy song of gratitude and praise; \n\nIf heaven and earth, with beauty fraught, \nLead to His throne thy raptured thought, \nIf there thou lov'st His love to read, \nThen, wanderer, thou art blest indeed."}
