{"subject": "In Poetry", "text": "I loved the fight, in poetry first \nThe freedom word by word, in poetry \nLine by line I loved to live \nSo I loved anger and bliss... \nYour bright days, \nMy optimistic friends, \nAll, all in poetry. \nWhatever I\u00edve lost... \nEverything I\u00edve found, in poetry. \nIs it our love only, \nThat precedes rhyme, \nThere\u00eds also exile, \nAnd imprisonment as well."}
