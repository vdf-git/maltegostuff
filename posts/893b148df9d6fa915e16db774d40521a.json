{"subject": "From SHHH", "text": "The counter intelligence community registers its disquiet \ntoo many of us now, too much getting out \n\nit's an awkward day for dentists as the case drags on \nand no one much is smiling now, not the firemen \n\nnor the baggage handlers, nurses, first time buyers \nand since they changed the city boundaries and lowered the fares \n\nmy taxi driver's blue with rage, who never asked anyone to live in Celbridge \nor fucking Maynooth, but what it must be to sit back in the evening  \n\nwith your tooth repaired and your bags intact, watching  \nthe last of the light revive the carpet and know \n\nyou've passed your five yearly vetting review, your grandparents \nhaven't let you down, your teenage son, your childhood friend \n\nhaven't spilled the beans, no-one has marched from the grave \nto rattle his bones and bloody the carpet, and you are whole again \n\na re-trusted member of the counter intelligence community \nyour swipe card unlocks the canteen again, knowledge swamps the room \n\nand you can cross the boundaries with your ear to the ground \nyour eyes on the cockpit, your whole body  \n\nas long as it lasts pressed to the pulse of the unquiet planet. Shhh!"}
