{"subject": "Lines Suggested By The Fourteenth Of February  -  I", "text": "Ere the morn the East has crimsoned,\nWhen the stars are twinkling there,\n(As they did in Watts's Hymns, and\nMade him wonder what they were\nWhen the forest-nymphs are beading\nFern and flower with silvery dew -\nMy infallible proceeding\nIs to wake, and think of you.\n\nWhen the hunter's ringing bugle\nSounds farewell to field and copse,\nAnd I sit before my frugal\nMeal of gravy-soup and chops:\nWhen (as Gray remarks) 'the moping\nOwl doth to the moon complain,'\nAnd the hour suggests eloping -\nFly my thoughts to you again.\n\nMay my dreams be granted never?\nMust I aye endure affliction\nRarely realised, if ever,\nIn our wildest works of fiction?\nMadly Romeo loved his Juliet;\nCopperfield began to pine\nWhen he hadn't been to school yet -\nBut their loves were cold to mine.\n\nGive me hope, the least, the dimmest,\nEre I drain the poisoned cup:\nTell me I may tell the chymist\nNot to make that arsenic up!\nElse, this heart shall soon cease throbbing;\nAnd when, musing o'er my bones,\nTravellers ask, 'Who killed Cock Robin?'\nThey'll be told, 'Miss Sarah J-s.'"}
