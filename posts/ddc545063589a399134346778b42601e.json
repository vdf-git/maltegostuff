{"subject": "Grigotts Wizarding Bank Poem", "text": "Enter, stranger, but take heed\nOf what awaits the sin of greed,\nFor those who take, but do not earn,\nMust pay most dearly in their turn,\nSo if you seek beneath our floors\nA treasure that was never yours,\nThief, you have been warned, beware\nOf finding more than treasure there."}
