{"subject": "Jerusalem", "text": "And did those feet in ancient time\nWalk upon England's mountains green?\nAnd was the holy Lamb of God\nOn England's pleasant pastures seen? \n\nAnd did the Countenance Divine\nShine forth upon our clouded hills?\nAnd was Jerusalem builded here\nAmong these dark Satanic mills? \n\nBring me my bow of burning gold:\nBring me my arrows of desire:\nBring me my spear: O clouds unfold!\nBring me my chariot of fire. \n\nI will not cease from mental fight,\nNor shall my sword sleep in my hand\nTill we have built Jerusalem\nIn England's green and pleasant land."}
