{"subject": "French", "text": "(Dedicated to Victor French who died of cancer on June 15,1989) \n\nYou starred on Highway to heaven, Carter country and even on Little house on the prairie.\nIt's sad to know that you are dead and buried.\nOne moment everything seemed to be fine.\nBut then we lost you in June of 1989.\n\nSometimes you had a beard and other times you only had a mustache.\nYou made a great contribution to TV in the past.\nYou had a career that shined bright.\nBut you died at fifty-four and that wasn't right.\n\nWhen you guest starred on Gunsmoke, you played the bad guy.\nPeople cared about you and hated to see you die.\nWhen you played as the heavy, you never flinched.\nRest in peace, Victor French."}
