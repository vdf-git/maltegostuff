{"subject": "Thanksgiving", "text": "Nature, erewhile so marvelously lovely, is bereft\nOf her supernal charm;\nAnd with the few dead garlands of departed splendor left,\nLike crape upon her arm,\nIn boreal hints, and sudden gusts\nThat fan the glowing ember,\nBy multitude of ways fulfills\nThe promise of November.\n\nUpon the path where Beauty, sylvan priestess, sped away,\nLies the rich afterglow\nOf Indian Summer, bringing round the happy holiday\nThat antedates the snow:\nThe glad Thanksgiving time, the cheer,\nThe festival commotion\nThat stirs fraternal feeling from\nThe mountains to the ocean.\n\nO Hospitality! unclose thy bounty-laden hand\nIn generous dealing, where\nIs gathered in reunion each long-severed household band,\nAnd let no vacant chair\nShow where the strongest, brightest link\nIn love's dear chain is broken--\nA symbol more pathetic than\nBy language ever spoken.\n\nInto the place held sacred to the memory of some\nBeloved absentee,\nPerchance passed to the other shore, oh, let the stranger come\nAnd in gratuity\nPartake of festal favors that\nShall sweeten hours of labor,\nAnd strengthen amity and love\nUnto his friend and neighbor.\n\nLet gratitude's pure incense in warm orisons ascend,\nA blessing to secure,\nAnd gracious impulse bearing largesse of good gifts extend\nTo all deserving poor;\nSo may the day be hallowed by\nUnstinted thanks and giving,\nIn sweet remembrance of the dead\nAnd kindness to the living."}
