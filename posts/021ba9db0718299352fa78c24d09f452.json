{"subject": "Robinson", "text": "The dog stops barking after Robinson has gone.\nHis act is over. The world is a gray world,\nNot without violence, and he kicks under the grand piano,\nThe nightmare chase well under way.\n\nThe mirror from Mexico, stuck to the wall,\nReflects nothing at all. The glass is black.\nRobinson alone provides the image Robinsonian.\n\nWhich is all of the room--walls, curtains,\nShelves, bed, the tinted photograph of Robinson's first wife,\nRugs, vases panatelas in a humidor.\nThey would fill the room if Robinson came in.\n\nThe pages in the books are blank,\nThe books that Robinson has read. That is his favorite chair,\nOr where the chair would be if Robinson were here.\n\nAll day the phone rings. It could be Robinson \nCalling. It never rings when he is here.\n\nOutside, white buildings yellow in the sun.\nOutside, the birds circle continuously\nWhere trees are actual and take no holiday."}
