{"subject": "Speculation", "text": "If at some future day we two should meet,\nStand face to face before the staring crowd,\nAnd pull from Love's dead form the decent shroud\nThat time has wound about from head to feet\u2014\nI scarcely know what words would come to greet\nYour presence, if they would be soft or loud,\nWould your head be held high or humbly bowed,\nAnd would the moment bitter be or sweet\nTo me, as you pushed back the long past years,\nWould I rejoice, perhaps, at this new pain ?\nAt least 'twould mean that I could live again,\nAnd had not washed away my soul with tears.\nI think there might be much that I could bless\nIn that deliverance out of nothingness."}
