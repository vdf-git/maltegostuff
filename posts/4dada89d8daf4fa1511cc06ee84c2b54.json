{"subject": "The Death Of Cleopatra", "text": "I GO\u2014from all earth can give, riven\n    By fate's sternest mandate\u2014so\u2014so,\nA Queen in a fiery car driven,\n    To meet her god-lover\u2014I go.\n\nThat blissful reunion to hasten,\n    Hie, hie, with the worm to my breast;\nAnd here let its fatal lips fasten\u2014\n    On here where a god's head would rest.\n\nHere, here let it suck and be suckled,\n    On what hath this pallid cheek dyed,\nWhen on his fell weapon I've buckled,\n    And frolic-mad mimicked his stride.\n\nThat golden day's vanished, yet, clingeth\n    One hope to the fallen one,\u2014nay,\nA lay in the murky cloud ringeth,\n    And dances her heart at that lay.\n\n'Even yet will she meet with his olden\n    Blink' rings that sweet music;\u2014'her love,\nWhose smile will make Hades more golden\n    Than Jove's gilded palace above.\n\n'Even yet will she thrill with the glory\n    That stream from his looks, as she'd thrill;\nAnd hear from his tongue the sweet story\n    Of what she once was\u2014and is still!\n\n'A Queen is she not, who o'er victors,\n    A victor hath trodden, while Kings\nWould smile on her pr\u00e6tors and lictors,\n    And gift their attendants with rings?\n\n'And so in the far future ages,\n    Some poet will chant to the throng;\nAnd Rulers, and Heroes, and Sages,\n    An echo return to the song.\n\n'Then spirits Titanic shall wonder\n    At one who o'er nations would reign,\nAs if the dread bolt of the thunder\n    Had danced in delight in her train.\n\n'As if Jove himself had forbidden\n    All ill thro' her portals to tread,\nAnd here would on lightning have ridden\n    To save a small hair of her head.\n\n'A god-guarded women, they'll hold her;\n    A god-illumed soul\u2014and aright!\nAy, where were the eyes could behold her,\n    And not in her glory delight?\n\n'Her graces a Pompey would dazzle;\n    A C\u00e6sar his faulchion would sheath,\nTheir vassal to be\u2014and their vassal\n    Shall now be the victor-king\u2014Death.\n\n'Her body will perish, but rarer\n    The spirit that gilds it will gleam,\nAnd to her own Marcus yet fairer\n    Whatever seemed fairest, will seem.\n\n'The sun-soaring bird afire flashes\n    A wreck to the wonder-bound earth;\nBut up the next hour from its ashes,\n    Again the sun-scaler goes forth.\n\n'A Ph\u0153nix the Ph\u0153nix succeedeth;\n    So up from the dust doth she spring,\nAnd go in a lustre that feedeth\n    With rapture the eyes of her King.\n\n'His star, from his burnished throne yonder,\n    He sees, as he saw her of old,\nA-far on the Cydnus\u2014a wonder,\n    That turns the black Styx into gold.\n\n'And hers he is still.'\u2014Thro' my anguish,\n    Thus rings that sweet voice in my ears:\nAnd not in her sorrows may languish\n    The soul which such harmony hears.\n\nThat voice, at its sound I'm uplifted,\n    Nor feel as I've felt, weak and worn;\nThat voice at its music I'm gifted\n    With strength yet the foeman to scorn.\n\nThe Roman may giggle, the Roman\n    May sound his brass timbrels in mirth\nShall he make a mock of the woman\n    Erewhile the delight of the earth?\n\nShall she to the seven-hilled City\n    In triumph be hurried in deed?\nNo, no, from their laughter or pity,\n    Ah, see by the viper she's freed.\n\nFreed, free is her spirit and given\n    Power\u2014'longings immortal '\u2014and oh!\u2014\nA Queen in a fiery car driven\n    To meet her god-lover, I go."}
