{"subject": "For A Woman", "text": "Eden, lost to all but fancy,\nWas it ever aught but legend\nHanded down from sire to son,\nAs descriptive of the region,\nOf the sunny haunts of love?\nFamous garden where the passion,\nBursting first disclosed the morn\nWhose effulgent, beaming glory\nCleft old Chaos, brain and spine;\nLit up incense burning shrine,\nIn the heart of man for Eve.\n'Round that shrine the zeal of Adam,\nGlowing like the flaming sword,\nSoon forgot his peaceful Eden,\nAnd the order of his lord;\nLeft the garden to its thistles,\nAnd his Master to His wrath,\nBartered Eden for a woman,\nBraved the fates to please his wife;\nTook her from the lap of nature\nJust as God had fashioned her,\nIn her rare bewitchery.\nEver since that fatal error,\nWhether fact or mythic story,\nFrom the ancient tomes of thought,\nBrought by art through mystic glory,\nThey have journeyed, both astray,\nOver many steeps of woe;\nThrough the fens and bogs of shame,\nFled from sorrow unto sorrow,\nSounding all the deeps of pain;\nBut never crossed, nor can again,\nEden in their pilgrimage.\nTalked with God in burning bushes,\nHeld the seas till Isr'el passed;\nAte of manna fresh from heaven;\nTook a town with trumpet blast;\nSlept with lions, stood in fire;\nAnd, in Prince of Bethlehem,\nHad a God to mourn their dead,\nAnd vivify the corpse again;\nBut ne'er since man squandered Eden\nOn the fancy of a maiden,\nHas he found the land of bliss.\nMay be, after all, old Eden\nIs wrapped within our meaner selves\nHid beneath our pride ard envy;\nThat the sword which us repels;\nIs our secret wickedness:\nCould we deftly lift the curtain\nWhich the cunning serpent draws,\nLike the veil of night about us,\nWe would find that paradise,\nLike a flower in winter, lies\n'Neath the stubbles of our souls,\n'So near and yet so far away',\nFor who has ever purged his heart,\nOf all the guilt that in it lies,\nThough the purging would impart\nTo him the bliss of paradise?\nWho does not harbor in his breast\nThe fruitage of forbidden things\nCulled from beauty's lips and heart,\nAnd folded in between the leaves\nOf memory's roll of reveries:\nA charm, a hope, a dream!\nWhether truth, fancy or legend\nIs what allures our faith through fears,\nLet us hope beyond the shadows\nOf this wilderness of tears,\nWe shall reach the blest dominion\nThat so long has failed us here;\nWhere our friends will cease to doubt us,\nWhere our foes will learn to love;\nStill let's hope to find the Eden\nWhence we wandered with our maiden;\nIf not here, beyond the bourn.\nLet us hope life's pilgrimage,\nHas some other goal than Hell;\nHope that we may find the glory,\nWhence the first degenerate fell;\nHope to foil the shafts of envy;\nHope to sooth the pangs of pain;\nHope to find our dead are living;\nHope to find our living dead\nTo the errors time is weaving;\nTo lip service and deceiving\nHope to conquer death at last."}
