{"subject": "Mother", "text": "Never a sigh for the cares that she bore for me\n  Never a thought of the joys that flew by;\nHer one regret that she couldn't do more for me,\n  Thoughtless and selfish, her Master was I.\n\nOh, the long nights that she came at my call to me!\n  Oh, the soft touch of her hands on my brow!\nOh, the long years that she gave up her all to me!\n  Oh, how I yearn for her gentleness now!\n\nSlave to her baby!  Yes, that was the way of her,\n  Counting her greatest of services small;\nWords cannot tell what this old heart would say of her,\n  Mother \u2014 the sweetest and fairest of all."}
