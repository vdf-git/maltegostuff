{"subject": "The Orient Express", "text": "One looks from the train\nAlmost as one looked as a child. In the sunlight\nWhat I see still seems to me plain,\nI am safe; but at evening\nAs the lands darken, a questioning\nPrecariousness comes over everything.\nOnce after a day of rain\nI lay longing to be cold; after a while\nI was cold again, and hunched shivering\nUnder the quilt's many colors, gray\nWith the dull ending of the winter day,\nOutside me there were a few shapes\nOf chairs and tables, things from a primer;\nOutside the window\nThere were the chairs and tables of the world ...\nI saw that the world\nThat had seemed to me the plain\nGray mask of all that was strange\nBehind it -- of all that was -- was all.\nBut it is beyond belief.\nOne thinks, \"Behind everything\nAn unforced joy, an unwilling\nSadness (a willing sadness, a forced joy)\nMoves changelessly\"; one looks from the train\nAnd there is something, the same thing\nBehind everything: all these little villages,\nA passing woman, a field of grain,\nThe man who says good-bye to his wife --\nA path through a wood all full of lives, and the train\nPassing, after all unchangeable\nAnd not now ever to stop, like a heart --\nIt is like any other work of art,\nIt is and never can be changed.\nBehind everything there is always\nThe unknown unwanted life."}
