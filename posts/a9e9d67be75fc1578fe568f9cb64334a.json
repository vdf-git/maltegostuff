{"subject": "Peter Sinning And Repenting", "text": "When Peter boasted, soon he fell,\nYet was by grace restored;\nHis case should be regarded well\nBy all who fear the Lord. \n\nA voice it has, and helping hand,\nBacksliders to recall;\nAnd cautions those who think they stand,\nLest suddenly they fall. \n\nHe said, Whatever others do,\nWith Jesus I'll abide;\nYet soon amidst a murd'rous crew\nHis suff'ring Lord denied. \n\nHe who had been so bold before,\nNow trembled like a leaf;\nNot only lied, but cursed and swore,\nTo gain the more belief. \n\nWhile he blasphemed he heard the cock,\nAnd Jesus looked in love;\nAt once, as if by lightning struck,\nHis tongue forbore to move. \n\nDelivered thus from Satan's snare\nHe starts, as from a sleep;\nHis Saviour's look he could not bear,\nBut hasted forth to weep. \n\nBut sure the faithful cock had crowed\nA hundred times in vain;\nHad not the Lord that look bestowed,\nThe meaning to explain. \n\nAs I, like Peter, vows have made,\nYet acted Peter's part;\nSo conscience, like the cock, upbraids\nMy base, ungrateful heart. \n\nLord Jesus, hear a sinner's cry,\nMy broken peace renew;\nAnd grant one pitying look, that I\nMay weep with Peter too."}
