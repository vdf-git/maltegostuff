{"subject": "Threshold", "text": "Between the terrible ease\nOf promise and the flowering\nOf regret, I must lay myself bare:\nI have learned desire\nIs a habit, a calling of flesh\nAnd spirit to repeat\nPresences, a need for\nAccumulation\nOf movements,\nOf moments.\n\nIn my room, at the office,\nInside the mall, on the train\nHome, I still wait for the inanities\nOf your texts, for your promises\nOf intimacy, remembering\nWeeks ago, you changed\nYour number and your lover\nSo that you may know\nThe secrets of other bodies.\n\nBut I shall tell you\nThe costs: I am alone\nHere in my apartment\nLearning to unlearn\n\nThe habit of your existence,\nRepeating your absences\u2014\nOh not because nothingness\nIs being\u2019s other self\u2014\nBecause only one body\nIs enough\nIn this faithless world:\nOne body, not ever our own,\nNor ever ours."}
