{"subject": "The Lay Of Marie - Canto Fourth", "text": "Marie, as if upon the brink\nOf some abyss, had paus'd to think;\nAnd seem'd from her sad task to shrink.\nOne hand was on her forehead prest,\nThe other clasping tight her vest;\nAs if she fear'd the throbbing heart\nWould let its very life depart.\nYet, in that sad, bewilder'd mien,\nTraces of glory still were seen;\nTraces of greatness from above,\nOf noble scorn, devoted love;\nOf pity such as angels feel,\nOf clinging faith and martyr'd zeal!\n\nCan one, who by experience knows\nSo much of trial and of woes,\nLate prone to kindle and to melt,\nTo feel whatever could be felt,\nTo suffer, and without complaint,\nAll anxious hopes, depressing fears;\nHer heart with untold sorrows faint,\nEyes heavy with unshedden tears,\nThrough every keen affliction past,\nCan that high spirit sink at last?\nOr shall it yet victorious rise,\nBeneath the most inclement skies,\nSee all it loves to ruin hurl'd,\nSmile on the gay, the careless world;\nAnd, finely temper'd, turn aside\nIts sorrow and despair to hide?\nOr burst at once the useless chain,\nTo seem and be itself again?\n\nWill Memory evermore controul,\nAnd Thought still lord it o'er her soul?\nQueen of all wonders and delight,\nSay, canst not thou possess her quite,\nSweet Poesy! and balm distil\nFor every ache, and every ill?\nLike as in infancy, thy art\nCould lull to rest that throbbing heart!\nCould say to each emotion, Cease!\nAnd render it a realm of peace,\nWhere beckoning Hope led on Surprize\nTo see thy magic forms arise!\n\nOh! come! all awful and sublime,\nArm'd close in stately, nervous rhyme,\nWith wheeling chariot, towering crest\nAnd Amazonian splendors drest!\nOr a fair nymph, with airy grace,\nAnd playful dimples in thy face,\nLight let the spiral ringlets flow,\nAnd chaplet wreath along thy brow--\nThou art her sovereign! Hear her now\nAgain renew her early vow!\nThe fondest votary in thy train,\nIf all past service be not vain,\nMight surely be receiv'd again!\n\nBehold those hands in anguish wrung\nOne instant!--and but that alone!\nWhen, waving grief, again she sang,\nThough in a low, imploring tone.\n\n'Awake, my lyre! thy echoes bring!\nNow, while yon phoenix spreads her wing!\nFrom her ashes, when she dies,\nAnother brighter self shall rise!\n'Tis Hope! the charmer! fickle, wild;\nBut I lov'd her from a child;\nAnd, could we catch the distant strain,\nSure to be sweet, though false and vain,\nMost dear and welcome would it be!--\nThy silence says 'tis not for me!\n\n'With Pity's softer-flowing strain,\nAwake thy sleeping wires again!\nFor she must somewhere wander near,\nIn following danger, death, and fear!\nFrom her regard no shade conceals;\nHer ear e'en sorrow's whisper steals:\nShe leads us on all griefs to find;\nTo raise the fall'n, their wounds to bind--\nOh! not in that reproachful tone,\nAdvise me first to heal my own!\n\n'Alas! I cannot blame the lyre!\nWhat strain, what theme can she inspire,\nWhose tongue a hopeless mandate brings!\nWhose tears are frozen on the strings!\nAnd whose recoiling, languid prayer,\nDenies itself, in mere despair?\nSo tamely, faintly, forth it springs;\nJust felt upon the pliant strings,\nIt flits in sickly languor by,\nNerv'd only with a feeble sigh!\n\n'I yield submissive, and again\nResume my half-abandon'd strain!\nLeading enchain'd sad thoughts along,\nRemembrance prompting all the song!\nBut, in the journey, drawing near\nTo what I mourn, and what I fear,\nThe sad realities impress\nToo deeply; hues of happiness,\nAnd gleams of splendors past, decay;\nThe storm despoiling such a day,\nGives to the eye no clear, full scope,\nBut scatters wide the wrecks of Hope!\nYet the dire task I may not quit--\n'Twas self impos'd; and I submit,\nTo paint, ah me! the heavy close,\nThe full completion of my woes!\nAnd, as a man that once was free,\nWhose fate impels him o'er the sea,\nNow spreads the sail, now plies the oar,\nYet looks and leans towards the shore,\nI feel I may not longer stay,\nYet even in launching court delay.\n\n'Before De Stafford should unfold\nThat secret which must soon be told;\nMy terrors urg'd him to comply;\nFor oh! I dar'd not then be nigh;\nAnd let the wide, tumultuous sea,\nArise between the king and me!\n'O! tell him, my belov'd, I pine away,\nSo long an exile from my native home;\nTell him I feel my vital powers decay,\nAnd seem to tread the confines of the tomb;\nBut tell him not, it is extremest dread\nOf royal vengeance falling on my head!\n\n''Say, if that favour'd land but bless my eyes,\nThat land of sun and smiles which gave me birth,\nLike the renew'd Antaeus I shall rise,\nOn touching once again the parent earth!\nSay this, but whisper not that all delight,\nAll health, is only absence from his sight!'\n\n'My Eustace smil'd--' It shall be so;\nFrom me and love shall Marie go!\nBut on the land, and o'er the sea,\nAttended still by love and me!\nThe eagle's eye, to brave the light,\nThe swallow's quick, adventurous flight,\nThat faithfulness shall place in view,\nThat service, daring, prompt, and true,\nYet insufficient emblems be\nOf zeal for her who flies from me!\n\n''Deserter? hope not thus to scape!\nThy guardian still, in every shape,\nShall covertly those steps pursue,\nAnd keep thy welfare still in view!\nMore fondly hovering than the dove\nShall be my ever watchful love!\nThan the harp's tones more highly wrought,\nShall linger each tenacious thought!\nApt, active shall my spirit be\nIn care for her who flies from me!'\n\n'And, it had been indeed a crime\nTo leave him, had I known the time,\nThe fearful length of such delay,\nProtracting but from day to day,\nWhich reach'd at length two tedious years\nOf dark surmises and of fears!\n\n'How often, on a rocky steep,\nWould I upon his summons keep\nAn anxious watch: there patient stay\nTill light's thin lines have died away\nIn the smooth circle of the main,\nAnd render'd all expectance vain.\n\n'At the blue, earliest glimpse of morn,\nPleas'd with the lapse of time, return;\nFor now, perchance, I might not fail,\nTo see the long expected sail!\nThen, as it blankly wore away,\nCourted the fleeting eye to stay!\nAs they regardless mov'd along,\nWooed the slow moments in a song.\nThe time approaches! but the Hours\nWith languid steps advance,\nAnd loiter o'er the summer flowers,\nOr in the sun-beams dance!\nOh! haste along! for, lingering, ye\nDetain my Eustace on the sea!\n\n'Hope, all on tiptoe, does not fail\nTo catch a cheering ray!\nAnd Fancy lifts her airy veil,\nIn wild and frolic play!\nKind are they both, but cruel ye,\nDetaining Eustace on the sea!\n\n'Sometimes within my cot I staid,\nAnd with my precious infant play'd.\n'Those eyes,' I cried, 'whose gaze endears,\nAnd makes thy mother's flow in tears!\nThose tender lips, whose dimpled stray\nCan even chase suspense away!\nThose artless movements, full of charms,\nThose graceful, rounded, rosy arms,\nShall soon another neck entwine,\nAnd waken transports fond as mine!\nThat magic laugh bespeaks thee prest\nAs surely to another breast!\nThat name a father's voice shall melt,\nThose looks within his heart be felt!\nDrinking thy smiles, thy carols, he\nShall weep, for very love, like me!\n\n'Those who in children see their heirs,\nHave numberless, diverging cares!\nLess pure for them affection glows,--\nLess of intrinsic joy bestows,\nLess mellowing, less enlivening, flows!\nOh! such not even could divine\nA moment's tenderness like mine!\nHad he been destin'd to a throne,\nHis little darling self alone,\nBereft of station, grandeur, aught\nBut life and virtue, love and thought,\nCould wake one anxious thrill, or share\nOne hallow'd pause's silent prayer!\n\n'Ye scenes, that flit my memory o'er,\nDeck'd in the smiles which then ye wore,\nIn the same gay and varied dress,\nI cannot but admire and bless!\nWhat though some anxious throbs would beat,\nSome fears within my breast retreat,\nYet then I found sincere delight,\nWhenever beauty met my sight,\nWhether of nature, chance, or art;\nEach sight, each sound, impress'd my heart,\nGladness undrooping to revive,\nAll warm, and grateful, and alive!\nBut ere my spirit sinks, so strong\nRemembrance weighs upon the song,\nPass we to other themes along!\n\n'Say, is there any present here,\nWhom I can have a cause to fear?--\nWhom it were wrongful to perplex,\nOr faulty policy to vex?\nIn what affrights the quiet mind\nMy bitter thoughts employment find!\nIn what torments a common grief\nDo I alone expect relief!\nOur aching sorrows to disclose,\nOur discontents, our wrongs repeat,\nTo hurl defiance at our foes,\nAnd let the soul respire, is sweet!\nAll that my conscience wills I speak\nAt once, and then my heart may break!\n\n'Too sure King Henry's presage rose;--\nDe Brehan link'd him with our foes:\nYes! ours! the Brehans us'd to be\nPatterns of faith and loyalty:\nAnd many a knightly badge they wore,\nAnd many a trace their 'scutcheons bore,\nOf noble deeds in days of yore,--\nOf royal bounty, and such trust\nAs suits the generous and the just.\n\n'From every record it appears,\nThat Normandy three hundred years\nHas seen in swift succession run\nWith English kings, from sire to son:\nBut which of all those records saith,\nThat we may change and barter faith:\nThat if our favour is not sure,\nOr our inheritance secure;\nIf envy of a rival's fame,\nOr hatred at a foeman's name,\nOr other reason unconfest,\nNow feigning sleep in every breast;\nUpon our minds, our interest weigh,\nWhile any fiercer passion sway;\nWe may invite a foreign yoke,\nAll truth disown'd, allegiance broke?\nPlot, and lay guileful snares to bring,\nAt cost of blood, a stranger king?\nAnd of what blood, if it succeed,\nDo ye atchieve the glorious deed?\nNot of the base! when ye surprize\nA lurking mischief in the eyes,\nDark hatred, cunning prompt to rise,\nAnd leap and catch at any prey,\nSuch are your choice! your comrades they!\nBut if a character should stand\nNot merely built by human hand;\nCommon observances; the ill\nSurrounding all; a wayward will;\nEnvy; resentment; falsehood's ease\nTo win its way, evade, and please:\nIf, turning from this worldly lore,\nAs soul-debasing, servile, poor,\nThe growing mind becomes, at length,\nHealthy and firm in moral strength;\nAllows no parley and no plea,\nThe sources of its actions free,\nThey spring strait forward, to a goal\nWhich bounds, surmounts, and crowns the whole!\nYe seek not to allay such force,\nTo interrupt so bold a course!\nWhat were the use of minds like these,\nThat will not on occasion seize,\nNor stoop to aid the dark design,\nNor follow in the devious line?\nAs soon, in the close twisted brake,\nCould lions track the smooth, still snake,\nAs they the sinuous path pursue\nWhich policy may point to you!\nNay, menace not with eyes, my lords!\nYe could not fright me with your swords.\n\n'E'en threats to punish, and to kill\nWith tortures difficult to bear,\nSeem as they would not higher fill\nThe measure of my own despair!\n\n'Such terrors could not veil the hand\nNow pointing to my husband's bier;\nNor could such pangs a groan command\nThe childless mother should not hear!\n\n'All now is chang'd! all contest o'er,\nHere sea-girt England reigns no more;\nAnd if your oaths are bound as fast,\nAnd kept more strictly than the last,\nYe may, perchance, behold the time\nService to her becomes a crime!\n\n'The troubles calling Eustace o'er,\nRefresh'd my eyes, my heart, once more;\nAnd when I gave, with pleasure wild,\nInto his circling arms our child,\nI seem'd to hold, all evil past,\nMy happiness secure at last;\nBut found, too soon, in every look,\nIn every pondering word he spoke,\nReceding thought, mysterious aim:\nAs I did all his pity claim.\nA watchfulness almost to fear\nDid in each cautious glance appear.\nAnd still I sought to fix his eye,\n\n'And read the fate impending there,--\nIn vain; for it refus'd reply.\n\n''Canst thou not for a moment bear\nEven thy Marie's look,' I cried,\n'More dear than all the world beside?'\nHe answer'd,' Do not thou upbraid!\nAnd blame me not, if thus afraid\nA needful, dear request to make.\nOne painful only for thy sake,\nI hesitate, and dread to speak,\nSeeing that flush upon thy cheek,\nThat shrinking, apprehensive air.--\nOh! born with me some ills to share,\nBut many years of future bliss,\nOf real, tranquil happiness;\nI may not think that thou wouldst choose\nThis prospect pettishly to lose\nFor self-indulgence! Understood,\nLove is the seeking others' good.\nIf we can ne'er resign delight,\nNor lose its object from our sight;\nAnd only present dangers brave,\nThat which we dearest hold to save;--\nIf, when remov'd beyond our eye,\nAll faith in heaven's protection die,\nCan all our tenderness atone\nFor ills which spring from that alone?'\nMy fancy rush'd the pause between--\n'What can this fearful prelude mean?\nArt thou but seeking some pretence,\nSo lately met! to send me hence?\nBeliev'st thou terrors will not shake,\nNor doubts distract, nor fears awake,\nIn absence? when no power, no charm,\nCan grant a respite from alarm!\nUnreal evils manifold,\nOften and differently told,\nScaring repose, each instant rise,\nFalse, but the cause of tears and sighs.\nHow often I should see thee bleed!\nNew terrors would the past succeed,\nWith not a smile to intervene\nOf fair security between!'\n\n''No, Marie, no! my wife shall share\nWith me the trials soldiers bear:\nNo longer and no more we part.---\nThy presence needful to my heart\nI now more evidently know;\nMaking the careful moments flow\nTo happy music! on my brow\nThe iron casque shall lighter prove,--\nThe corslet softer on my breast,\nThe shield upon my arm shall rest\nMore easy, when the hand of love\nThere places them. Our succours soon\nArrive; and then, whatever boon\nI shall think fitting to demand,\nMy gracious monarch's bounteous hand\nAwards as guerdon for my charge,\nAnd bids my wishes roam at large.\nThen if we from these rebels tear\nThe traitor honours which they wear,\nThy father's tides and domain\nShall flourish in his line again!\nAnd Marie's child, in time to come,\nShall call his grandsire's castle, home!\nAlas! poor babe! the scenes of war\nFor him too harsh and frightful are!\nWould that he might in safety rest\nUpon my gentle mother's breast!\nThat in the vessel now at bay,\nIn Hugh de Lacy's care he lay!\nMy heart and reason would be free,\nIf he were safe beyond the sea.\n\n''Nay, let me not my love displease!\nBut is it fit, that walls like these\nThe blooming cherub should inclose!\nAnd when our close approaching foes\nAre skirmishing the country o'er,\nWe must adventure forth no more.'\n\n'At length I gave a half consent,\nResign'd, submissive, not content:\nFor, only in intensest prayer,\nFor, only kneeling did I dare,\nSustaining thus my sinking heart,\nSuffer my infant to depart.\nOh! yet I see his sparkling tears;\nHis parting cries are in my ears,\nAs, strongly bending back the head,\nThe little hands imploring spread,\nHim from my blinding sight they bore,\nDown from the fort along the shore.\n\n'From the watch-tower I saw them sail,\nAnd pour'd forth prayers--of no avail!\nYet, when a tempest howl'd around,\nHurling huge branches on the ground\nFrom stately trees; when torrents swept\nThe fields of air, I tranquil kept.--\n\n'Hope near a fading blossom\nWill often take her stand;\nRevive it on her bosom,\nOr screen it with her wand:\nBut to the leaves no sunbeams press,\nHer fair, thick locks pervading;\nThrough that bright wand no dew-drops bless,\nStill cherish'd, and still fading:--\nBeneath her eye's bright beam it pines,\nFed by her angel smile, declines.\n\n'Eustace, meanwhile, with feverish care,\nSeem'd worse the dire suspense to bear.\nBewilder'd, starting at the name\nOf messenger, when any came,\nWith body shrinking back, he sought,\nWhile his eye seem'd on fire with thought,\nDefying, yet subdued by fear,\nTo ask that truth he dar'd not hear.\n\n'He went his rounds.--The duty done,\nHis mind still tending toward his son;\nWith spirit and with heart deprest,\nA judgment unsustain'd by rest;--\nFainting in effort, and at strife\nWith feelings woven into life;\nAnd with the chains of being twin'd\nBy links so strong, though undefin'd,\nThey curb or enervate the brain,\nWeigh down by languor, rack by pain,\nAnd spread a thousand subtil ties\nAcross the tongue, and through the eyes;\nTill the whole frame is fancy vext,\nAnd all the powers of mind perplext.\n\n'What wonder, then, it sunk and fail'd!\nWhat wonder that your plans prevail'd!\nIn vain by stratagem you toil'd;--\nHis skill and prudence all had foil'd;\nFor one day's vigilance surpast\nSeeming perfection in the last.\nEach hour more active, more intent,\nUnarm'd and unassail'd he went;\nWhile every weapon glanc'd aside,\nHis armour every lance defied.\nThe blow that could that soul subdue\nAt length was struck--but not by you!\nIt fell upon a mortal part--\nA poison'd arrow smote his heart;\nThe winds impelling, when they bore\nWrecks of the vessel to our shore!\n\n'Oh! ever dear! and ever kind!\nWhat madness could possess thy mind,\nFrom me, in our distress, to fly?\nTrue, much delight had left my eye;\nAnd, in the circle of my bliss,\nOne holy, rapturous joy to miss\nWas mine!--Yet I had more than this,\nBefore my wounds were clos'd, to bear!\nSee thee, an image of despair,\nJust rush upon my woe, then shun\nHer who alike deplor'd a son;\nAnd, ere alarm had taken breath,\nBe told, my husband, of thy death!\nAnd feel upon this blighted sphere\nNo tie remain to bind me here!\nStill in my life's young summer see\nA far and weary path to thee!\nAlong whose wild and desert way\nNo sportive tribes of fancy play;\nNo smiles that to the lips arise,\nNo joys to sparkle in the eyes;--\nNo thrills of tenderness to feel,\nNo spring of hope, no touch of zeal.\nAll sources of heart-feeling stopt,\nAll impulse, all sustainment dropt.\nWith aching memory, sinking mind,\nThrough this drear wilderness to find\nThe path to death;--and pining, roam\nMyriads of steps to reach the tomb!\nOf which to catch a distant view,\nThe softest line, the faintest hue,\nAs symbol when I should be free,\nWere happiness too great for me!'\n\nHere clos'd at once, abrupt, the lay!\nThe Minstrel's fingers ceas'd to play!\nAnd, all her soul to anguish given,\nDoubted the pitying care of Heaven.\nBut evil, in its worst extreme,\nIn its most dire, impending hour,\nShall vanish, like a hideous dream,\nAnd leave no traces of its power!\n\nThe vessel plunging on a rock,\nWreck threatening in its fellest shape,\nNo moment's respite from the shock,\nNo human means or power to 'scape,\nSome higher-swelling surge shall free,\nAnd lift and launch into the sea!\nSo, Marie, yet shall aid divine\nRestore that failing heart of thine!\nThough to its centre wounded, griev'd,\nThough deeply, utterly bereav'd.\nThere genial warmth shall yet reside,\nThere swiftly flow the healthful tide;\nAnd every languid, closing vein,\nDrink healing and delight again!\n\nAt present all around her fades,\nHer listless ear no sound pervades.\nHer senses, wearied and distraught,\nPerceive not how the stream of thought,\nRising from her distressful song,\nIn hurrying tide has swept along,\nWith startling and resistless swell,\nThe panic-stricken Isabel!\nWho--falling at her father's feet,\nLike the most lowly suppliant, kneels;\nAnd, with imploring voice, unmeet\nFor one so fondly lov'd, appeals.--\n\n'Those looks have been to me a law,\nAnd solely by indulgence bought,\nWith zeal intense, with deepest awe,\nA self-devoted slave, I caught\nMy highest transport from thy smile;\nAnd studied hourly to beguile\nThe lightest cloud of grief or care\nI saw those gracious features wear!\nIf aught induced me to divine\nA hope was opposite to thine,\nMy fancy paus'd, however gay;\nMy silent wishes sunk away!\nDispleasure I have never seen,\nBut sickness has subdued thy mien;\nWhen, lingering near, I still have tried\nTo cheer thee, and thou didst approve;\nBut something still each act belied,\nMy manner chill'd, restrain'd my love!\nE'en at the time my spirit died\nWith aching tenderness, my eye,\nEncountering thine, was cold and dry!\nTo maim intention, fondness,--came\nThe sudden impotence of shame.\nThy happiness was thriftless wealth,\nFor I could only hoard by stealth!\nAffection's brightly-glowing ray\nShone with such strong, o'erpowering sway,\nThat service fainted by the way!\n\n'But now an impulse, like despair,\nMakes me these inner foldings tear!\nWith desperate effort bids me wrest\nThe yearning secret from my breast!\nFar be the thought that any blame\nCan fix on thy beloved name!\nThe hapless Minstrel may not feign;\nBut thou, I know, canst all explain--\nYet let me from this place depart,\nTo nurse my fainting, sicken'd heart!\nYet let me in a cloister dwell,\nThe veiled inmate of a cell;\nTo raise this cowering soul by prayer!--\nReproach can never enter there!\n\n'Turn quickly hence that look severe!\nAnd, oh! in mercy, not a tear!\nThe most profuse of parents, thou\nDidst every wish fulfil--allow;\nTill that which us'd to please--invite,\nHad ceas'd to dazzle and delight;\nAnd all thy gifts almost despis'd,\nThe love that gave alone I priz'd.\n\n'My yielding spirit bows the knee;\nMy will profoundly bends to thee:\nBut paltry vanities resign'd,\nWealth, gauds, and honours left behind,\nI only wanted, thought to quit\nThis strange, wild world, and make me fit\nFor one of better promise--given\nTo such as think not this their heaven!\nNay, almost in my breast arose\nA hope I scarcely dare disclose;\nA hope that life, from tumult free,--\nA life so harmless and so pure,\nA calm so shelter'd, so secure,\nAt length might have a charm for thee!\nThat supplications, patient, strong,\nMight not remain unanswer'd long!\nAnd all temptations from thee cast,\nThe altar prove thy home at last!'\n\nThe artless Isabel prevails--\nThat hard, unbending spirit fails!\nNot many words her lips had past,\nEre round her his fond arms were cast;\nBut, while his vengeful conscience prais'd,\nHe chid; and, frowning, would have rais'd\nTill her resistance and her tears,\nThe vehemence of youthful grief,\nHer paleness, his paternal fears,\nCompell'd him to afford relief;\nAnd forc'd the agonizing cry--\nThat he could never her deny!\n\nOf what ambition sought, beguil'd,\nHis crimes thus fruitless! and his child,\nThe beautiful, the rich and young--\nNow, in his most triumphant hours!\nThe darling he had nurs'd in flowers!\nHis pride, the prais'd of every tongue!\nSo gentle as she was!--the rein\nOf influence holding, to restrain\nHis harsher power, without pretence,\nIn graceful, gay beneficence--\nAn angel deem'd, her only care\nTo comfort and to please!\nWhose smiling, whose unconscious air,\nBespoke a heart at ease--\nBy her--on whom sweet hopes were built,\nHis cup when fill'd thus rashly spilt!\nThe treasures he had heap'd in vain,\nThrown thankless on his hands again!\nWhile--father to this being blest,\nHe saw a dagger pierce her breast,\nIn knowledge of his former guilt!\nAnd of his projects thus bereft,\nWhat had the wretched parent left?\nOh! from the wreck of all, he bore\nA richer, nobler freight ashore!\nAnd filial love could well dispense\nOn earth a dearer recompense,\nIf he its real worth had known,\nThan full success had made his own.\n\nSo ardent and so kind of late,\nIs Marie careless of their fate,\nThat, wrapt in this demeanour cold,\nHer spirits some enchantments hold?\nThat thus her countenance is clos'd,\nWhere high and lovely thoughts repos'd!\nQuench'd the pure light that us'd to fly\nTo the smooth cheek and lucid eye!\nAnd fled the harmonizing cloud\nWhich could that light benignly shroud,\nSoothing its radiance to our view,\nAnd melting each opposing hue,\nTill deepening tints and blendings meet\nMade contrast' self serene and sweet.\n\nVainly do voices tidings bring,\nThat succours from the former king,\nToo late for that intent,--are come\nTo take the dead and wounded home;\nWaiting, impatient, in the bay,\nTill they can safely bear away,--\nNot men that temporize and yield,\nBut heroes stricken in the field;\nTrue sons of England, who, unmov'd,\nCould hear their fears, their interest plead;\nLed by no lure they disapprov'd,\nStooping to no unsanction'd deed!\nSpirits so finely tun'd, so high,\nThat grovelling influences die\nAssailing them! The venal mind\nCan neither fit inducement find\nTo lead their purpose or their fate--\nTo sway, to probe, or stimulate!\nWhat knowledge can they gain of such\nWhom worldly motives may not touch?\nThose who, the instant they are known,\nEach generous mind springs forth to own!\nJoyful, as if in distant land,\nAmid mistrust, and hate, and guile,\nInsidious speech, and lurking wile,\nThey grasp'd a brother's cordial hand!\nHearts so embued with fire from heaven,\nThat all their failings are forgiven!\nNay, o'er, perchance, whose laurel wreath\nWhen tears of pity shine,\nWe softer, fonder sighs bequeath;\nMore dear, though less divine.\n\nCan kind and loyal bosoms bleed,\nAnd Marie not bewail the deed?\nCan England's valiant sons be slain,\nIn whose fair isle so long she dwelt--\nTo whom she sang, with whom she felt!\nCan kindred Normans die in vain!\nOr, banish'd from their native shore,\nEnjoy their sire's domains no more!\nBrothers, with whom her mind was nurs'd,\nWho shar'd her young ideas first!--\nAnd not her tears their doom arraign?\n\nAlas! no stimulus avails!\nEach former potent influence fails:\nNo longer e'en a sigh can part\nFrom that oppress'd and wearied heart.\n\nWhat broke, at length, the spell? There came\nThe sound of Hugh de Lacy's name!\nIt struck like lightning on her ear--\nBut did she truly, rightly hear?\nFor terror through her senses ran,\nE'en as the song of hope began.--\nHis charge arriv'd on England's coast,\nConsign'd where they had wish'd it most,\nHad brave De Lacy join'd the train\nWhich sought the Norman shores again?--\n_Then_ liv'd her darling and her pride!\nWhat anguish was awaken'd there!\nA joy close mating with despair--\nHe liv'd for whom her Eustace died!\n\nYes! yes! he lives! the sea could spare\nThat Island warrior's infant heir!\nFor whom, when thick-surrounding foes,\nNigh spent with toil, had sought repose,\nSlow stealing forth, with wary feet,\nFrom covert of secure retreat,--\nA soldier leading on the way\nTo where his dear commander lay,--\nOver the field, at dead midnight,\nBy a pale torch's flickering light,\nDid _Friendship_ wander to behold,\nBreathing, but senseless, pallid, cold,\nWith many a gash, and many a stain,\nHim,--whom the morrow sought in vain!\n_Love_ had not dar'd that form to find,\nUngifted with excelling grace!\nNor, thus without a glimpse of mind,\nAcknowledg'd that familiar face!\nDisfigur'd now with many a trace\nOf recent agony!--Its power\nHad not withstood this fatal hour!\n_Friendship_ firm-nerv'd, resolv'd, mature,\nWith hand more steady, strong, and sore,\nCan torpid Horror's veil remove,\nWhich palsies all the force of _Love!_\n\nWhat is _Love's_ office, then? To tend\nThe hero rescued by a friend!\nAll unperceiv'd, with balmy wing\nTo wave away each restless thing\nThat wakes to breathe disturbance round!\nTo temper all in peace profound.\nWith whisper soft and lightsome touch,\nTo aid, assuage,--relieving much\nOf trouble neither seen nor told--\nOf pain, which it alone divines,\nWhich scarcely he who feels defines,\nWhich lynx-like eyes alone behold!\n\nAnd heavy were De Stafford's sighs,\nAnd oft impatient would they rise;\nThough Friendship, Honour's self was there,\nUntil he found a nurse more fair!\nA nicer tact, a finer skill,\nTo know and to perform his will--\nUntil he felt the healing look,\nThe tones that only Marie spoke!\n\nHow patient, then, awaiting ease,\nAnd suffering pain, he cross'd the seas!\nHow patient, when they reach'd the shore,\nA long, long tract he journey'd o'er!\nThough days and months flow'd past, at length,\nEre he regain'd his former strength,\nHe yet had courage to sustain,\nWithout a murmur, every pain!\n'At home once more--with friends so true--\nMy boy recover'd thus'--he cried,\n'His mother smiling by my side--\nResigned each lesser ill I view!\nAs bubbles on the Ocean's breast,\nWhen gloriously calm, will rise;\nAs shadows from o'er-clouded skies,\nOr some few angry waves may dance\nNor ruffle that serene expanse;\nSo lightly o'er my comfort glides\nEach adverse feeling--so subsides\nEach discontent--and leaves me blest!'"}
