{"subject": "Anastasis", "text": "What shall it profit a man\nTo gain the world\u2013if he can\u2013\nAnd lose his soul, as they say\nIn their uninstructed way?\n\nThe whole of the world in gain;\nThe whole of your soul! Too vain\nYou judge yourself in the cost.\n'Tis you\u2013not your soul\u2013is lost.\n\nYour soul! If you only knew\nYou would reach to the heaven's blue,\nTo the heartmost centre sink,\nEre you severed the silver link,\n\nTo be lost in your petty lust\nAnd scattered in cosmic dust.\nFor your soul is a Shining Star\nWhere the Throne and the Angels are.\n\nAnd after a thousand years\nWith the salve of his bottled tears\nYour soul shall gather again\nFrom the dust of a world of pain\n\nThe frame of a slave set free\u2013\nThe man that you ought to be,\nThe man you may be to-night\nIf you turn to the Valley of Light."}
