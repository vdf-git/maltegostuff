{"subject": "Elevated Aims", "text": "O garland not the worthless weeds\nWhich shade the sweet flowers in the meads,\nNeglecting the most bright and fair\nLike undiscerning zealots do,\nWho rather love the false than true,\nAnd to the grain prefer the tare.\nStrange, that so many set their store\nNot on the glorious golden ore,\nBut in the very worthless dross;\nTheir minds with heaps of rubbish filled,\nUntrained-unexercised-unskilled\nTo sever mental gain from loss.\nOurs be a higher, nobler goal,\nTo cultivate the sense and soul,\nNot with the useless and the rude;\nBut with truth's ever-during charm\nThe powers of darkness to disarm,\nAnd fill the world with light and good."}
