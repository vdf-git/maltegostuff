{"subject": "Sonnet-Ii", "text": "'Tis summer still, yet now and then a leaf\nFalls from some stately tree. True type of life!\nHow emblamatic of the pangs that grief\nWrings from our blighted hopes, that one by one\ndropp from us in our wrestle with the strife\nAnd natural passions of our stately youth.\nAnd thus we fall beneath life's summer sun.\nEach step conducts us through an opening door\nInto new halls of being, hand in hand\nWith grave Experience, until we command\nThe open, wide-spread autumn fields, and store\nThe full ripe grain of Wisdom and of Truth.\nAs on life's tott'ring precipice we stand,\nOur sins like withered leaves are blown about the land."}
