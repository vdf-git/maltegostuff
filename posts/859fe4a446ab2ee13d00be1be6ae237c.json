{"subject": "To My Brother", "text": "It's difficult to live, my brother,\namong such thick-skulled blunderheads;\nthe fires of my youth are smothered,\nmy heart is torn to bitter shreds.\nI love the land where I was born\nand I protect its ancient wealth,\nyet when I show these oafs my scorn\nI bring destruction to myself.\nDreams of darkness, thoughts of storm,\nhave nailed my young soul to the cross.\nO, who will place a friendly hand\nupon my heart in its distress?\nNo one, no one. Freedom, joy\nneither does it recognize;\nyet it passionately joins\nits answer to a people's cries.\nBrother, I shed tears in secret\nwhere anguished people are interred;\nbut, tell me, what should I respect\nupon this dead, insidious earth?\nNothing, nothing. To a frank\nand upright voice there's no reply,\nand your soul, too, does not react\nto the voice of God - a people's cry."}
