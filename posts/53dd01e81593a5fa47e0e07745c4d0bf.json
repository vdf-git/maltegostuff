{"subject": "North Among Green Vines", "text": "Where the sun has entered the western hills, \nI look for a monk in his little straw hut; \nBut only the fallen leaves are at home, \nAnd I turn through chilling levels of cloud \nI hear a stone gong in the dusk, \nI lean full-weight on my slender staff \nHow within this world, within this grain of dust, \nCan there be any room for the passions of men?"}
