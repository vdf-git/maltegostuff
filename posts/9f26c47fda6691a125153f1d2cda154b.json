{"subject": "Virtual Fields", "text": "Sun Breaks over Oak, \nPushing back nights dark cloak, \nWho's fingers black the colours do choke. Grass glistens with dew, \nWaits to wet the clumsy shoe, \nCascading out a rainbow hue. Spiders weave silken thread, \nBroken where things do tread, \nTo hunt, browse or cover fled. Fieldmice cling to stalks of rye, \nTo nibble then listen for hawks cry, \nWho's hunting means they may die. Butterfly's dance on flower heads, \nSipping nectar that is shed, \nThen dance to to other pollen beds. Raynard prancing through the fog, \nTo pause at moles earthy sod, \nEars pricked with nose to prod, \nInto mounds where cattle trod. Wondering at what I see, \nMyself I ask, how can this be, \nTo spoil nature's past reality. Save programme, sighing wanting to see more, \nI turn, I leave through the hologram door, \nSaddened by the world we have no more."}
