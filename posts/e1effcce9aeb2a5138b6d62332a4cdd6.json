It's done.\n\nFirst I pushed my eyes in\nand tilted my head back.\nThen I filled up the holes\nwith eau de javel and white spirit.\n\nThat anything goes is a delusion.\nIt's the air that is tenuous.\nGive me time to come round.\n\nBury me where I requested\nwater and let me be - out of reach -\nof fish.\n\nTranslation: John Irons"}
