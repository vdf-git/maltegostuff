{"subject": "A Black-List", "text": "'Resolved that we will post,' the tradesmen say,\n'All names of debtors who do never pay.'\n'Whose shall be first?' inquires the ready scribe\n'Who are the chiefs of the marauding tribe?'\nLo! high Parnassus, lifting from the plain,\nUpon his hoary peak, a noble fane!\nWithin that temple all the names are scrolled\nOf village bards upon a slab of gold;\nTo that bad eminence, my friend, aspire,\nAnd copy thou the Roll of Fame, entire.\nYet not to total shame those names devote,\nBut add in mercy this explaining note:\n'These cheat because the law makes theft a crime,\nAnd they obey all laws but laws of rhyme.'"}
