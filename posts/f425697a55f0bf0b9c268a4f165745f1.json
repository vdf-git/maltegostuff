{"subject": "If Amy Lowell Had Been James Whitcomb Riley", "text": "When you came you were like red wine and honey, \nAnd the taste of you burnt my mouth with its sweetness. \nNow you are like morning bread-- \nSmooth and pleasant, \nI hardly taste you at all, for I know your savour, \nBut I am completely nourished. \n\n--AMY LOWELL, in The Chim\u00e6ra.\n\nWhen I wuz courtin' Annie, she wuz honey an' red wine, \nShe made me feel all jumpy, did that ol' sweetheart o' mine; \nWunst w'en I went to Crawfordsville, on one o' them there trips, \nI kissed her--an' the burnin' taste wuz sizzlin' on my lips. \nAn' now I've married Annie, an' I see her all the time, \nI do not feel the daily need o' bustin' into rhyme. \nAn' now the wine-y taste is gone, fer Annie's always there, \nAn' I take her fer granted now, the same ez sun an' air. \nBut though the honey taste wuz sweet, an' though the wine wuz strong, \nYet ef I lost the sun an' air, I couldn't git along."}
