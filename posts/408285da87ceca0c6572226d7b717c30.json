{"subject": "The Dead Church", "text": "Wild wild wind, wilt thou never cease thy sighing?\nDark dark night, wilt thou never wear away?\nCold cold church, in thy death sleep lying,\nThe Lent is past, thy Passion here, but not thine Easter-day.\n\nPeace, faint heart, though the night be dark and sighing;\nRest, fair corpse, where thy Lord himself hath lain.\nWeep, dear Lord, above thy bride low lying;\nThy tears shall wake her frozen limbs to life and health again."}
