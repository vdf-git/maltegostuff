In The", "text": "And live I still to see Relations gone,\nAnd yet survive to sound this wailing tone;\nAh, woe is me, to write thy Funeral Song,\nWho might in reason yet have lived long,\nI saw the branches lopt the Tree now fall,\nI stood so nigh, it crusht me down withal;\nMy bruised heart lies sobbing at the Root,\nThat thou dear Son hath lost both Tree and fruit:\nThou then on Seas sailing to forreign Coast;\nWas ignorant what riches thou hadst lost.\nBut ah too soon those heavy tydings fly,\nTo strike thee with amazing misery;\nOh how I simpathize with thy sad heart,\nAnd in thy griefs still bear a second part:\nI lost a daughter dear, but thou a wife,\nWho lov'd thee more (it seem'd) then her own life.\nThou being gone, she longer could not be,\nBecause her Soul she'd sent along with thee.\nOne week she only past in pain and woe,\nAnd then her sorrows all at once did go;\nA Babe she left before, she soar'd above,\nThe fifth and last pledg of her dying love,\nE're nature would, it hither did arrive,\nNo wonder it no longer did survive.\nSo with her Children four, she's now a rest,\nAll freed from grief (I trust) among the blest;\nShe one hath left, a joy to thee and me,\nThe Heavens vouchsafe she may so ever be.\nChear up, (dear Son) thy fainting bleeding heart,\nIn him alone, that caused all this smart;\nWhat though thy strokes full sad &amp; grievous be,\nHe knows it is the best for thee and me."}
