{"subject": "Iron Wine", "text": "The ore in the crucible is pungent, smelling like acrid wine,\nIt is dusky red, like the ebb of poppies,\nAnd purple, like the blood of elderberries.\nSurely it is a strong wine - juice distilled of the fierce iron.\nI am drunk of its fumes.\nI feel its fiery flux\nDiffusing, permeating,\nWorking some strange alchemy\u2026\nSo that I turn aside from the goodly board,\nSo that I look askance upon the common cup,\nAnd from the mouths of crucibles\nSuck forth the acrid sap."}
