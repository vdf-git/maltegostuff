With sharp sounds \nShe worked her way through the shelves, \nDisturbing his books. He stood \nStill and watched as they toppled \nAll over the floor. She began to \nTo pull out her clothes, snapping hangers, \nTearing and clutching at the stuffed shelves. \nThe trinkets accumulated over the years, \nMost of them his gifts, spilled out awkwardly, \nDisplaying the ravages of the years. \nThen came the knick-knacks- \nPerfumes, lipsticks, other women's things. \nStill she moved about noisily: \nWhat else was hers and hers alone? \nThese years had blurred the distinctions. \nThere was no way to make a clean getaway: \nStuffing everything into a suitcase, \nZipping it up smartly, and then walking out, \nTriumphant, as in other movies. Here \nEverything was going to be messy and painful. \nEvery little item, every possession, had its \nOwn memory, embalmed by their joint \nOwnership; now each thing that had \nCemented their relationship had to be violated \nIndividually. And for years to come they \nWould relive, in their own separate ways, \nThe agony of that day when they broke \nInto two."}
