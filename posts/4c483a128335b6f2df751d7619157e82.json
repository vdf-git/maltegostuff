{"subject": "Fanny Forester", "text": "A THOUSAND sweet ties bind her here, \u2014 \nO friend! thy fears are vain! \nThe blessed angels will not break \nSo soon this golden chain; \nAnd God, our God, who loveth her, \nShall breathe on her again! \n\nThe languor of her step shall yet \nWith winter snows depart; \nHer feet shall spring o'er carpets wrought \nBy Flora's loving art, \nAnd keep time to the joyous beat \nOf her exulting heart! \n\nSpring flowers, \u2014 they must, to one like her, \nBring life in their perfume; \nThough lilies mind us of the young, \nPale bending to the tomb, \nShe shall tread among the violets \nBefore the lilies bloom! \n\nYes, when the summer roses blush, \nHer cheek shall catch their glow; \nAnd when the summer birds return, \nHer tones, no longer low, \nShall, like their strains, on raptured ears \nIn waves of music flow. \n\nOur souls' arms are around her thrown! \nShe must not pass away \nNow, when, too humble for the proud, \nToo lonely for the gay, \nThe altar of sweet Poesy \nIs falling to decay! \n\nO, there may we behold her yet \nIn her young beauty bow! \nThere may we hear her glad lip breathe \nHer consecration vow, \nEarth's warm life lighting up her eye, \u2014 \nIts glory on her brow! \n\nThere long a priestess may she serve, \nWith vestments pure and fair, \nThere offer up her wing\u00e8d dreams, \nYoung doves from heaven's own air, \nAnd pour the rich wine of her soul \nAs a libation there!"}
