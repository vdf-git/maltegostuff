{"subject": "The Nominy While Riding The Stang", "text": "With a ran, tan, tan,\nOn my old tin can,\nHeigh tinkle, how tinkle, \nHeigh tinkle tang.\n'Tis not for my fault nor thy fault\nThat I Ride the stang- \nBut for Mrs.- -  and her good-man.\nShe bang'd him, she bang'd him,\nFor spending a penny when he stood in need.\nShe up with a three-footed stool;\nShe struck him so hard, and she cut so deep,\nTill the blood ran down like a new stuck sheep!"}
