{"subject": "Poem For A Daughter", "text": "'I think I'm going to have it,'\nI said, joking between pains.\nThe midwife rolled competent\nsleeves over corpulent milky arms.\n'Dear, you never have it,\nwe deliver it.'\nA judgement the years proved true.\nCertainly I've never had you\n\nas you still have me, Caroline.\nWhy does a mother need a daughter?\nHeart's needle, hostage to fortune,\nfreedom's end. Yet nothing's more perfect\nthan that bleating, razor-shaped cry\nthat delivers a mother to her baby.\nThe bloodcord snaps that held\ntheir sphere together. The child,\ntiny and alone, creates the mother.\n\nA woman's life is her own\nuntil it is taken away\nby a first, particular cry.\nThen she is not alone\nbut a part of the premises\nof everything there is:\na time, a tribe, a war.\nWhen we belong to the world\nwe become what we are."}
