{"subject": "The Dark Day", "text": "A three-day-long rain from the east-- \nan terminable talking, talking \nof no consequence--patter, patter, patter. \nHand in hand little winds \nblow the thin streams aslant. \nWarm. Distance cut off. Seclusion. \nA few passers-by, drawn in upon themselves, \nhurry from one place to another. \nWinds of the white poppy! there is no escape!-- \nAn interminable talking, talking, \ntalking . . .it has happened before. \nBackward, backward, backward."}
