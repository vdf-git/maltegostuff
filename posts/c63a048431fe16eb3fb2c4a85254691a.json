And forth I leapt in haste,\nAnd flung a slender birch-bough around the maiden\u2019s waist.\n\nShe blushed and she fluttered,\u2014then turned away to run,\nBut straight into my sturdy arms I caught the little one.\nI put her gently down on the heather at my side, \nWhere tiny crimson flowers the rocky ledges hide.\n\nAnd as the prisoned birdling, when he knows his cage full well,\nPours forth his notes full blithely, and naught his mirth can quell,\nSo little Synn\u00f6;v, striving in vain my hold to flee,\nTurned quick on me her roguish eyes and laughed full heartily. \n\n\u201cMy little Synn\u00f6v,\u201d said I, \u201cif I remember right,\n\u2019T was something that you promised me a year ago to-night.\u201d\nThen straight she stayed her laughter and serious she grew,\nAnd whispered, \u201cDearest Thoralf, you promised something too.\u201d"}
