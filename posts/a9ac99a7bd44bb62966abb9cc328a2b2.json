{"subject": "The Taxidermist", "text": "From other men he stands apart,\nWrapped in sublimity of thought\nWhere futile fancies enter not;\nWith starlike purpose pressing on\nWhere Agassiz and Audubon\nLabored, and sped that noble art\nYet in its pristine dawn.\n\nSomething to conquer, to achieve,\nMakes life well worth the struggle hard;\nIts petty ills to disregard,\nIn high endeavor day by day\nWith this incentive--that he may\nSomehow mankind the richer leave\nWhen he has passed away.\n\nForest and field he treads alone,\nFinding companionship in birds,\nIn reptiles, rodents, yea, in herds\nOf drowsy cattle fat and sleek;\nFor these to him a language speak\nTo common multitudes unknown\nAs tones of classic Greek.\n\nUnthinking creatures and untaught,\nThey to his nature answer back\nSomething his fellow mortals lack;\nAnd oft educe from him the sigh\nThat they unnoticed soon must die,\nLeaving of their existence naught\nTo be remembered by.\n\nMan may aspire though in the slough;\nMay dream of glory, strive for fame,\nThirst for the prestige of a name.\nAnd shall these friends, that so invite\nThe study of the erudite,\nEver as he beholds them now\nPerish like sparks of light?\n\nNay, 'tis his purpose and design\nTo keep them: not like mummies old\nPapyrus-mantled fold on fold,\nBut elephant, or dove, or swan,\nIts native hue and raiment on,\nIn effigy of plumage fine,\nOr skin its native tawn.\n\nWhat God hath wrought thus time shall tell,\nAnd thus endowment rich and vast\nBe rescued from the buried past;\nAnd rare reliques that never fade\nBe in the manikin portrayed\nTill taxidermy witness well\nThe debt to science paid.\n\nLo! one appeareth unforetold--\nThis re-creator, yea, of men;\nMaking him feel as born again\nWho looketh up with reverent eyes,\nThrough wonders that his soul surprise,\nThat great Creator to behold\nAll-powerful, all-wise."}
