{"subject": "Carpe Diem", "text": "Age saw two quiet children \nGo loving by at twilight, \nHe knew not whether homeward, \nOr outward from the village, \nOr (chimes were ringing) churchward, \nHe waited, (they were strangers) \nTill they were out of hearing \nTo bid them both be happy. \n'Be happy, happy, happy, \nAnd seize the day of pleasure.' \nThe age-long theme is Age's. \n'Twas Age imposed on poems \nTheir gather-roses burden \nTo warn against the danger \nThat overtaken lovers \nFrom being overflooded \nWith happiness should have it. \nAnd yet not know they have it. \nBut bid life seize the present? \nIt lives less in the present \nThan in the future always, \nAnd less in both together \nThan in the past. The present \nIs too much for the senses, \nToo crowding, too confusing- \nToo present to imagine."}
