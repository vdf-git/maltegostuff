I ain't got nothin' to say.\nNothin'!\nI told the perlice I hadn't nothin'.\nThey know'd real well 'twas me.\nTher warn't no supposin',\nKetchin' me in the woods as they did,\nAn' me in my house dress.\nFolks don't walk miles an' miles\nIn the drifted snow,\nWith no hat nor wrap on 'em\nEf everythin's all right, I guess.\nAll right? Ha! Ha! Ha!\nNothin' warn't right with me.\nNever was.\nOh, Lord! Why did I do it?\nWhy ain't it yesterday, and Ed here agin?\nMany's the time I've set up with him nights\nWhen he had cramps, or rheumatizm, or somethin'.\nI used ter nurse him same's ef he was a baby.\nI wouldn't hurt him, I love him!\nDon't you dare to say I killed him. 'Twarn't me!\nSomethin' got aholt o' me. I couldn't help it.\nOh, what shall I do! What shall I do!\nYes, Sir.\nNo, Sir.\nI beg your pardon, I - I -\nOh, I'm a wicked woman!\nAn' I'm desolate, desolate!\nWhy warn't I struck dead or paralyzed\nAfore my hands done it.\nOh, my God, what shall I do!\nNo, Sir, ther ain't no extenuatin' circumstances,\nAn' I don't want none.\nI want a bolt o' lightnin'\nTo strike me dead right now!\nOh, I'll tell yer.\nBut it won't make no diff'rence.\nNothin' will.\nYes, I killed him.\nWhy do yer make me say it?\nIt's cruel! Cruel!\nI killed him because o' th' silence.\nThe long, long silence,\nThat watched all around me,\nAnd he wouldn't break it.\nI tried to make him,\nTime an' agin,\nBut he was terrible taciturn, Ed was.\nHe never spoke 'cept when he had to,\nAn' then he'd only say 'yes' and 'no'.\nYou can't even guess what that silence was.\nI'd hear it whisperin' in my ears,\nAn' I got frightened, 'twas so thick,\nAn' al'ays comin' back.\nEf Ed would ha' talked sometimes\nIt would ha' driven it away;\nBut he never would.\nHe didn't hear it same as I did.\nYou see, Sir,\nOur farm was off'n the main road,\nAnd set away back under the mountain;\nAnd the village was seven mile off,\nMeasurin' after you'd got out o' our lane.\nWe didn't have no hired man,\n'Cept in hayin' time;\nAn' Dane's place,\nThat was the nearest,\nWas clear way 'tother side the mountain.\nThey used Marley post-office\nAn' ours was Benton.\nTher was a cart-track took yer to Dane's in Summer,\nAn' it warn't above two mile that way,\nBut it warn't never broke out Winters.\nI used to dread the Winters.\nSeem's ef I couldn't abear to see the golden-rod bloomin';\nWinter'd come so quick after that.\nYou don't know what snow's like when yer with it\nDay in an' day out.\nEd would be out all day loggin',\nAn' I set at home and look at the snow\nLayin' over everythin';\nIt 'ud dazzle me blind,\nTill it warn't white any more, but black as ink.\nThen the quiet 'ud commence rushin' past my ears\nTill I most went mad listenin' to it.\nMany's the time I've dropped a pan on the floor\nJest to hear it clatter.\nI was most frantic when dinner-time come\nAn' Ed was back from the woods.\nI'd ha' give my soul to hear him speak.\nBut he'd never say a word till I asked him\nDid he like the raised biscuits or whatever,\nAn' then sometimes he'd jest nod his answer.\nThen he'd go out agin,\nAn' I'd watch him from the kitchin winder.\nIt seemed the woods come marchin' out to meet him\nAn' the trees 'ud press round him an' hustle him.\nI got so I was scared o' th' trees.\nI thought they come nearer,\nEvery day a little nearer,\nClosin' up round the house.\nI never went in t' th' woods Winters,\nThough in Summer I liked 'em well enough.\nIt warn't so bad when my little boy was with us.\nHe used to go sleddin' and skatin',\nAn' every day his father fetched him to school in the pung\nAn' brought him back agin.\nWe scraped an' scraped fer Neddy,\nWe wanted him to have a education.\nWe sent him to High School,\nAn' then he went up to Boston to Technology.\nHe was a minin' engineer,\nAn' doin' real well,\nA credit to his bringin' up.\nBut his very first position ther was an explosion in the mine.\nAnd I'm glad! I'm glad!\nHe ain't here to see me now.\nNeddy! Neddy!\nI'm your mother still, Neddy.\nDon't turn from me like that.\nI can't abear it. I can't! I can't!\nWhat did you say?\nOh, yes, Sir.\nI'm here.\nI'm very sorry,\nI don't know what I'm sayin'.\nNo, Sir,\nNot till after Neddy died.\n'Twas the next Winter the silence come,\nI don't remember noticin' it afore.\nThat was five year ago,\nAn' it's been gittin' worse an' worse.\nI asked Ed to put in a telephone.\nI thought ef I felt the whisperin' comin' on\nI could ring up some o' th' folks.\nBut Ed wouldn't hear of it.\nHe said we'd paid so much for Neddy\nWe couldn't hardly git along as 'twas.\nAn' he never understood me wantin' to talk.\nWell, this year was worse'n all the others;\nWe had a terrible spell o' stormy weather,\nAn' the snow lay so thick\nYou couldn't see the fences even.\nOut o' doors was as flat as the palm o' my hand,\nTher warn't a hump or a holler\nFer as you could see.\nIt was so quiet\nThe snappin' o' the branches back in the wood-lot\nSounded like pistol shots.\nEd was out all day\nSame as usual.\nAn' it seemed he talked less'n ever.\nHe didn't even say 'Good-mornin'', once or twice,\nAn' jest nodded or shook his head when I asked him things.\nOn Monday he said he'd got to go over to Benton\nFer some oats.\nI'd oughter ha' gone with him,\nBut 'twas washin' day\nAn' I was afeared the fine weather'd break,\nAn' I couldn't do my dryin'.\nAll my life I'd done my work punctual,\nAn' I couldn't fix my conscience\nTo go junketin' on a washin'-day.\nI can't tell you what that day was to me.\nIt dragged an' dragged,\nFer ther warn't no Ed ter break it in the middle\nFer dinner.\nEvery time I stopped stirrin' the water\nI heerd the whisperin' all about me.\nI stopped oftener'n I should\nTo see ef 'twas still ther,\nAn' it al'ays was.\nAn' gittin' louder\nIt seemed ter me.\nOnce I threw up the winder to feel the wind.\nThat seemed most alive somehow.\nBut the woods looked so kind of menacin'\nI closed it quick\nAn' started to mangle's hard's I could,\nThe squeakin' was comfortin'.\nWell, Ed come home 'bout four.\nI seen him down the road,\nAn' I run out through the shed inter th' barn\nTo meet him quicker.\nI hollered out, 'Hullo!'\nBut he didn't say nothin',\nHe jest drove right in\nAn' climbed out o' th' sleigh\nAn' commenced unharnessin'.\nI asked him a heap o' questions;\nWho he'd seed\nAn' what he'd done.\nOnce in a while he'd nod or shake,\nBut most o' th' time he didn't do nothin'.\n'Twas gittin' dark then,\nAn' I was in a state,\nWith the loneliness\nAn' Ed payin' no attention\nLike somethin' warn't livin'.\nAll of a sudden it come,\nI don't know what,\nBut I jest couldn't stand no more.\nIt didn't seem 's though that was Ed,\nAn' it didn't seem as though I was me.\nI had to break a way out somehow,\nSomethin' was closin' in\nAn' I was stiflin'.\nEd's loggin' axe was ther,\nAn' I took it.\nOh, my God!\nI can't see nothin' else afore me all the time.\nI run out inter th' woods,\nSeemed as ef they was pullin' me;\nAn' all the time I was wadin' through the snow\nI seed Ed in front of me\nWhere I'd laid him.\nAn' I see him now.\nThere! There!\nWhat you holdin' me fer?\nI want ter go to Ed,\nHe's bleedin'.\nStop holdin' me.\nI got to go.\nI'm comin', Ed.\nI'll be ther in a minit.\nOh, I'm so tired!\n(Faints)"}
