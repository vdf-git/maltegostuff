{"subject": "You", "text": "Only a long, low-lying lane\nThat follows to the misty sea,\nAcross a bare and russet plain\nWhere wild winds whistle vagrantly;\nI know that many a fairer path\nWith lure of song and bloom may woo,\nBut oh ! I love this lonely strath\nBecause it is so full of you. \n\nHere we have walked in elder years,\nAnd here your truest memories wait,\nThis spot is sacred to your tears,\nThat to your laughter dedicate;\nHere, by this turn, you gave to me\nA gem of thought that glitters yet,\nThis tawny slope is graciously\nBy a remembered smile beset. \n\nHere once you lingered on an hour\nWhen stars were shining in the west,\nTo gather one pale, scented flower\nAnd place it smiling on your breast;\nAnd since that eve its fragrance blows\nFor me across the grasses sere,\nFar sweeter than the latest rose,\nThat faded bloom of yesteryear. \n\nFor me the sky, the sea, the wold,\nHave beckoning visions wild and fair, \nThe mystery of a tale untold,\nThe grace of an unuttered prayer. \nLet others choose the fairer path\nThat winds the dimpling valley through, \nI gladly seek this lonely strath\nCompanioned by my dreams of you."}
