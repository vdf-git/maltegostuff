{"subject": "The Hay Field", "text": "With slender arms outstretching in the sun\nThe grass lies dead; \nThe wind walks tenderly and stirs not one \nFrail fallen head. \nOf baby creepings through the April day\nWhere streamlets wend,\nOf child-like dancing on the breeze of May, \nThis is the end. \nNo more these tiny forms are bathed in dew,\nNo more they reach\nTo hold with leaves that shade them from the blue\nA whispered speech. \nNo more they part their arms and wreathe them close\nAgain, to shield\nSome love-full little nest\u2013a dainty house\nHid in a field. \nFor them no more the splendour of the storm,\nThe fair delights\nOf moon and star-shine, glimmering faint and warm\nOn summer nights. \nTheir little lives they yield in summer death,\nAnd frequently\nAcross the field bereaved their dying breath\nIs brought to me."}
