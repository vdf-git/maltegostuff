{"subject": "The Path That Leads To Home", "text": "The little path that leads to home, \nThat is the road for me, \nI know no finer path to roam, \nWith finer sights to see. \nWith thoroughfares the world is lined \nThat lead to wonders new, \nBut he who treads them leaves behind \nThe tender things and true. \n\nOh, north and south and east and west \nThe crowded roadways go, \nAnd sweating brow and weary breast \nAre all they seem to know. \nAnd mad for pleasure some are bent, \nAnd some are seeking fame, \nAnd some are sick with discontent, \nAnd some are bruised and lame. \n\nAcross the world the gleaming steel \nHolds out its lure for men, \nBut no one finds his comfort real \nTill he comes home again. \nAnd charted lanes now line the sea \nFor weary hearts to roam, \nBut, Oh, the finest path to me \nIs that which leads to home. \n\n'Tis there I come to laughing eyes \nAnd find a welcome true; \n'Tis there all care behind me lies \nAnd joy is ever new. \nAnd, Oh, when every day is done \nUpon that little street, \nA pair of rosy youngsters run \nTo me with flying feet. \n\nThe world with myriad paths is lined \nBut one alone for me, \nOne little road where I may find \nThe charms I want to see. \nThough thoroughfares majestic call \nThe multitude to roam, \nI would not leave, to know them all, \nThe path that leads to home."}
