{"subject": "Rice-Field Road at Dusk", "text": "After Ko Un\n\nIn the village it's the season of dried grass,\nthe smell of \u200a\u200aburned dirt,\ngaslight glinting through blackened stubble.\nI walk home across the rice-fields,\nbrushing insects away from my face,\nremembering old Namdong who was buried yesterday.\nWhat does death ask of us?\nI must change whatever it was I was\nwhen the old man was alive.\nI keep looking at the rice-fields, glinting in the dark.\nBlasted by mildew, more withered than last year\u2009\u2014\nhow much work and love it must have taken.\nIn autumn, no matter how bad the harvest,\nhow big the debts\u2009\u2014\nno thought of \u200a\u200aleaving here, no thought of rest.\nAs life goes on, time isn't the largest thing to think of,\nit's the smallest.\nGrowing, going\nin drought or monsoon, mold or blight\u2009\u2014\nwhat is the rice if \u200anot alive?\n\nWith Sunja Kim Kwock"}
