{"subject": "Sierran Song", "text": "To the California Sierra Club \n\nCome climb the mountain trails with me,\nWhere pine-trees plume the sky, \nWhere snowy peaks salute the sea \nWhen herald winds pass by. \nWah ho! the day is blue, \nThe night with stars aglow; \nAnd all the dreams come true \nUp there\u2014wah ho! \n\nThe stream runs dancing on its way, \nThe meadows flush with flowers. \nThe gay birds sing a roundelay \nThrough all the crystal hours. \nWah ho! the sky is blue, \nThe world is soft as snow; \nAnd all the dreams come true \nUp there\u2014wah ho!\n\nCome hit the trail\u2014the cliff-bound vale\nOur stately house shall be. \nOur feet shall tread beyond the pale \nOf dull mortality. \nWah ho! the world is new, \nAnd heaven is all aglow! \nAnd every dream comes true \nUp there\u2014wah ho!"}
