{"subject": "Burial Of A Fairy Queen", "text": "On a verdant summer islet\nI beheld a wondrous scene,\nIn a trance of dreamy waking-\nBurial of a Fairy Queen!\nFirst I heard some small pipes playing,\nLike faint night-winds on the breeze,\nOr the sound of distant rain-drops,\nAs they fall among the trees.\nFloating softly o'er the waters,\nAnd from every bell of foam,\nThe fairy anthem echoed sweetly,\nSad as thoughts of distant home.\nNext the sound, as if of footsteps,\nO'er the grass plot mov'd along;\nAnd distinctly came the accents\nOf the solemn funeral song.\nLike the melting of the dew-drops,\nWithout words of grief or death,\nWas the soul-enthralling music,\nScarcely louder than a breath.\nThen my dreaming eyes were opened,\nAnd in wonder I espied\nThousands of the fairy creatures\nIn a circle, side by side.\nScarcely taller than the leaflets\nOf the herbage on the plain,\nWhile their heads were bowed with anguish,\nAnd their tear-drops fell like rain.\nIn the middle of the circle,\nOn a plat of grass most green,\nStood a bier of unknown flowers,\nWhereon lay the Fairy Queen.\nAh, she was pale as any lily,\nCold and motionless as snow!\nFainter grew their solemn dirges,\nAnd still deeper grew their wo!\nTwo sisters of the queenly fairy,\nStood at her feet and head,\nAnd sang heart-broken measures,\nTheir requiems o'er the dead.\nScarcely louder than the twittering\nOf the wood-lark's dewy breath-\nBut too full of desolation,\nAnd the dark despair of death!\nThen the flower-bier sank gently,\nAt the spot whereon it lay;\nAnd the magic turf clos'd o'er it-\nThus the dead queen pass'd away!\nBright dew-drops glittered on the sward-\nOne fleet moment more, and then\nThe mystic troop sailed duskily,\nAnd far from mortal ken.\nThe silence of the still midnight\nThe murmuring waters broke;\nThe moon, emerging from a cloud,\nShone on me, and I woke."}
