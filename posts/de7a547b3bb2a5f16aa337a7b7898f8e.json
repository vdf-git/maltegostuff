{"subject": "On A Bank As I Sate A Fishing: A Description Of The Spring", "text": "And now all Nature seem'd in love, \nThe lusty sap began to move;\nNew juice did stir th'embracing Vines,\nAnd Birds had drawn their Valentines:\nThe jealous Trout, that low did lie,\nRose at a well-dissembled flie:\nThere stood my Friend, with patient skill\nAttending of his trembling quill.\nAlready were the Eves possest\nWith the swift Pilgrims daubed nest.\nThe Groves already did rejoyce\nIn Philomels triumphing voice.\nThe showers were short, the weather mild,\nThe morning fresh, the evening smil'd.\nJune takes her neat-rub'd Pale, and now\nShe trips to milk the Sand-red Cow;\nWhere for some sturdy foot-ball Swain,\nJune strokes a sillabub or twain.\nThe Fields and Gardens were beset\nWith Tulip, Crocus, Violet:\nAnd now, though late, the modest Rose\nDid more then half a blush disclose.\nThus all look'd gay, all full of chear,\nTo welcome the New-livery'd year."}
