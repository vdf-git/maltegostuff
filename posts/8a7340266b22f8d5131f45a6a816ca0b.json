{"subject": "To The Miami", "text": "Kiss me, Miami, thou most constant one!\nI love thee more for that thou changest not.\nWhen Winter comes with frigid blast,\nOr when the blithesome Spring is past\nAnd Summer's here with sunshine hot,\nOr in sere Autumn, thou has still the pow'r\nTo charm alike, whate'er the hour.\n\nKiss me, Miami, with thy dewy lips;\nThrobs fast my heart e'en as thine own breast beats.\nMy soul doth rise as rise thy waves,\nAs each on each the dark shore laves\nAnd breaks in ripples and retreats.\nThere is a poem in thine every phase;\nThou still has sung through all thy days.\n\nTell me, Miami, how it was with thee\nWhen years ago Tecumseh in his prime\nHis birch boat o'er thy waters sent,\nAnd pitched upon thy banks his tent.\nIn that long-gone, poetic time,\nDid some bronze bard thy flowing stream sit by\nAnd sing thy praises, e'en as I?\n\nDid some bronze lover 'neath this dark old tree\nWhisper of love unto his Indian maid?\nAnd didst thou list his murmurs deep,\nAnd in thy bosom safely keep\nThe many raging vows they said?\nOr didst thou tell to fish and frog and bird\nThe raptured scenes that there occurred?\n\nBut, O dear stream, what volumes thou couldst tell\nTo all who know thy language as I do,\nOf life and love and jealous hate!\nBut now to tattle were too late,--\nThou who hast ever been so true.\nTell not to every passing idler here\nAll those sweet tales that reached thine ear.\n\nBut, silent stream, speak out and tell me this:\nI say that men and things are still the same;\nWere men as bold to do and dare?\nWere women then as true and fair?\nDid poets seek celestial flame,\nThe hero die to gain a laureled brow,\nAnd women suffer, then as now?"}
