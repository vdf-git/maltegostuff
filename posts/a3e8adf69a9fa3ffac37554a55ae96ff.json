{"subject": "Gently Lead Me, Star Divine.", "text": "Gently lead me, Star Divine,\n    Lead with bright unchanging ray;\n  O'er my lowly pathway shine,\n    I shall never lose my way;\n  Though uncertain be my tread,\nPitfalls deep, and mountains high,\n  Safely shall my feet be led,\n    By Thy beacon, in the sky.\n\n  Long ago, while journeying\n    Westward, o'er the desert wild,\n  Sages sought a promised King\n    In the person of a child;\n  By Thy bright illuminings,\n    To that manger, in the fold,\n  Thou did'st lead those shepherd kings;\n    Lead me, as Thou lead'st of old."}
