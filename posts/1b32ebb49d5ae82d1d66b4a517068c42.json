{"subject": "The Dead Man Walking", "text": "They hail me as one living,\nBut don't they know\nThat I have died of late years,\nUntombed although?\n\nI am but a shape that stands here,\nA pulseless mould,\nA pale past picture, screening\nAshes gone cold.\n\nNot at a minute's warning,\nNot in a loud hour,\nFor me ceased Time's enchantments\nIn hall and bower.\n\nThere was no tragic transit,\nNo catch of breath,\nWhen silent seasons inched me\nOn to this death ...\n\n-- A Troubadour-youth I rambled\nWith Life for lyre,\nThe beats of being raging\nIn me like fire.\n\nBut when I practised eyeing\nThe goal of men,\nIt iced me, and I perished\nA little then.\n\nWhen passed my friend, my kinsfolk,\nThrough the Last Door,\nAnd left me standing bleakly,\nI died yet more;\n\nAnd when my Love's heart kindled\nIn hate of me,\nWherefore I knew not, died I\nOne more degree.\n\nAnd if when I died fully\nI cannot say,\nAnd changed into the corpse-thing\nI am to-day,\n\nYet is it that, though whiling\nThe time somehow\nIn walking, talking, smiling,\nI live not now."}
