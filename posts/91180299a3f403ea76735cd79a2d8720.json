{"subject": "Sonet 87", "text": "Those beauties (Deare) which all thy sexe enuies,\nAs grieu'd men should such sacred wonders view:\nFor pompe apparel'd in a purple hue,\nDo whiles disdaine the pride of mortall eyes,\nWhich, ah, attempting farre aboue their might,\nDo gaze vpon the glorie of those Sunnes,\nWhil'st many a ray that from their brightnesse runnes,\nDoth dazle all that dare looke on their light:\nOr was it this, which \u00f4 I feare me most,\nThat cled with scarlet, so thy purest parts,\nThy face it hauing wounded worlds of harts,\nWould die her Lillies with the bloud they lost:\nThus ere thy cruelties were long conceal'd,\nThey by thy guiltie blush would be reueal'd."}
