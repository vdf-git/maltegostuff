{"subject": "Life", "text": "As late I journey'd o'er the extensive plain\nWhere native Otter sports his scanty stream,\nMusing in torpid woe a Sister's pain,\nThe glorious prospect woke me from the dream.\n\nAt every step it widen'd to my sight -\nWood, Meadow, verdant Hill, and dreary Steep,\nFollowing in quick succession of delight, -\nTill all - at once - did my eye ravish'd sweep!\n\nMay this (I cried) my course through Life portray!\nNew scenes of Wisdom may each step display,\nAnd Knowledge open as my days advance!\nTill what time Death shall pour the undarken'd ray,\nMy eye shall dart thro' infinite expanse,\nAnd thought suspended lie in Rapture's blissful trance."}
