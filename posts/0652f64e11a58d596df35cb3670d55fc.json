{"subject": "Dennis Shand", "text": "THE shadows fall along the wall, \nIt's night at Haye-la-Serre; \nThe maidens weave since day grew eve, \nThe lady's in her chair. \nO passing slow the long hours go \nWith time to think and sigh, \nWhen weary maidens weave beneath \nA listless lady's eye. \nIt's two days that Earl Simon's gone \nAnd it's the second night; \nAt Haye-la-Serre the lady's fair, \nIn June the moon is light. \nO it's \u201cMaids, ye'll wake till I come back,\u201d \nAnd the hound's i' the lady's chair: \nNo shuttles fly, the work stands by, \nIt's play at Haye-la-Serre. \nThe night is worn, the lamp's forlorn, \nThe shadows waste and fail; \nThere's morning air at Haye-la-Serre, \nThe watching maids look pale. \nO all unmarked the birds at dawn \nWhere drowsy maidens be; \nBut heard too soon the lark's first tune \nBeneath the trysting tree. \n\u201cHold me thy hand, sweet Dennis Shand,\u201d \nSays the Lady Joan de Haye, \n\u201cThat thou to-morrow do forget \nTo-day and yesterday. \n\u201cFor many a weary month to come \nMy lord keeps house with me, \nAnd sighing summer must lie cold \nIn winter's company. \n\u201cAnd many an hour I'll pass thee by \nAnd see thee and be seen; \nYet not a glance must tell by chance \nHow sweet these hours have been. \n\u201cWe've all to fear; there's Maud the spy, \nThere's Ann whose face I scor'd, \nThere's Blanch tells Huot everything, \nAnd Huot loves my lord. \n\u201cBut O and it's my Dennis 'll know, \nWhen my eyes look weary dim, \nWho finds the gold for his girdle-fee \nAnd who keeps love for him.\u201d \nThe morrow's come and the morrow-night, \nIt's feast at Haye-la-Serre, \nAnd Dennis Shand the cup must hand \nBeside Earl Simon's chair. \nAnd still when the high pouring's done \nAnd cup and flagon clink, \nTill his lady's lips have touched the brim \nEarl Simon will not drink. \nBut it's, \u201cJoan my wife,\u201d Earl Simon says, \n\u201cYour maids are white and wan.\u201d \nAnd it's, \u201cO,\u201d she says, \u201cthey've watched the night \nWith Maud's sick sister Ann.\u201d \nBut it's, \u201cLady Joan and Joan my bird, \nYourself look white and wan.\u201d \nAnd it's, \u201cO, I've walked the night myself \nTo pull the herbs for Ann: \n\u201cAnd some of your knaves were at the hutch \nAnd some in the cellarage, \nBut the only one that watched with us \nWas Dennis Shand your page. \n\u201cLook on the boy, sweet honey lord, \nHow drooped his eyelids be: \nThe rosy colour's not yet back \nThat paled in serving me.\u201d \nO it's, \u201cWife, your maids are foolish jades, \nAnd you're a silly chuck, \nAnd the lazy knaves shall get their staves \nAbout their ears for luck: \n\u201cBut Dennis Shand may take the cup \nAnd pour the wine to his hand; \nWife, thou shalt touch it with thy lips, \nAnd drink thou, Dennis Shand!\u201d"}
