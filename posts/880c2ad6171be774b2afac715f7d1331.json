{"subject": "L'Amitie: To Mrs. M. Awbrey.", "text": "Soule of my soule! my Joy, my crown, my friend! \nA name which all the rest doth comprehend; \nHow happy are we now, whose sols are grown, \nBy an incomparable mixture, One: \nWhose well acquainted minds are not as neare \nAs Love, or vows, or secrets can endeare. \nI have no thought but what's to thee reveal'd, \nNor thou desire that is from me conceal'd. \nThy heart locks up my secrets richly set, \nAnd my breast is thy private cabinet. \nThou shedst no teare but what but what my moisture lent, \nAnd if I sigh, it is thy breath is spent. \nUnited thus, what horrour can appeare \nWorthy our sorrow, anger, or our feare? \nLet the dull world alone to talk and fight \nAnd with their vast ambitions nature fright; \nLet them despise so innocent a flame, \nWhile Envy, pride, and faction play their game: \nBut we by Love sublim'd so high shall rise, \nTo pitty Kings, and Conquerours despise, \nSince we that sacred union have engrost, \nWhich they and all the sullen world have lost."}
