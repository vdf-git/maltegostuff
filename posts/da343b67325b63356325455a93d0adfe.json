{"subject": "The Natural History of Cockroaches", "text": "Jul 9th, 1755\nGleads kite the Saxon meers and marching hoopoes breed\nbut streams yield nothing but bull's head or miller's thumb;\nthe teams of ducks, widgeons, and multitudes of teal;\nowls like dogs that hide what they cannot eat.\nThree gross-beaks in my fields in the dead season,\nshot with my dreams of swallows on the Isle of Wight\ninstead of cock snipes piping and humming to seed.\nI have had yet no opportunity of procuring mice. \nAug 1st, 1759\nI pass the trappers and thrusters with loaded corves:\nI had rather look than go in pulpits. I write\nrain, ecstatic as a solo. The hood-mould\nshows water on the bulwark's central mullion\nbut the covert of eminence is truly beech,\nmost lovely of forest trees: glossy, pendulous,\nbeyond unmellow clay and crumbling black malm.\nIt seems the bees do not resent my large speaking trumpet.\nJul 14th, 1789\nThe Saxon's wolf-month: the floor sweats in wet weather\nand when the lavants flood, corn will be expensive.\nThe blattae were almost subdued with fly-water,\nsurviving for weeks without heads. Tubbed and pickled\na fat porker, then culled some scummings for rushes.\nParties of ousels canton on the Sussex downs\nand the goat-sucker or churn-owl jarrs on a bough\nwhile the Bastille storms into history and Selbourne."}
