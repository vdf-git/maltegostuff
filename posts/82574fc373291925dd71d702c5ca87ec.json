{"subject": "Birthday Of Daniel Webster", "text": "JANUARY 18, 1856\n\nWHEN life hath run its largest round\nOf toil and triumph, joy and woe,\nHow brief a storied page is found\nTo compass all its outward show!\n\nThe world-tried sailor tires and droops;\nHis flag is rent, his keel forgot;\nHis farthest voyages seem but loops\nThat float from life's entangled knot.\n\nBut when within the narrow space\nSome larger soul hath lived and wrought,\nWhose sight was open to embrace\nThe boundless realms of deed and thought,--\n\nWhen, stricken by the freezing blast,\nA nation's living pillars fall,\nHow rich the storied page, how vast,\nA word, a whisper, can recall!\n\nNo medal lifts its fretted face,\nNor speaking marble cheats your eye,\nYet, while these pictured lines I trace,\nA living image passes by:\n\nA roof beneath the mountain pines;\nThe cloisters of a hill-girt plain;\nThe front of life's embattled lines;\nA mound beside the heaving main.\n\nThese are the scenes: a boy appears;\nSet life's round dial in the sun,\nCount the swift arc of seventy years,\nHis frame is dust; his task is done.\n\nYet pause upon the noontide hour,\nEre the declining sun has laid\nHis bleaching rays on manhood's power,\nAnd look upon the mighty shade.\n\nNo gloom that stately shape can hide,\nNo change uncrown its brow; behold I\nDark, calm, large-fronted, lightning-eyed,\nEarth has no double from its mould.\n\nEre from the fields by valor won\nThe battle-smoke had rolled away,\nAnd bared the blood-red setting sun,\nHis eyes were opened on the day.\n\nHis land was but a shelving strip\nBlack with the strife that made it free\nHe lived to see its banners dip\nTheir fringes in the Western sea.\n\nThe boundless prairies learned his name,\nHis words the mountain echoes knew,\nThe Northern breezes swept his fame\nFrom icy lake to warm bayou.\n\nIn toil he lived; in peace he died;\nWhen life's full cycle was complete,\nPut off his robes of power and pride,\nAnd laid them at his Master's feet.\n\nHis rest is by the storm-swept waves\nWhom life's wild tempests roughly trie\nWhose heart was like the streaming eaves\nOf ocean, throbbing at his side.\n\nDeath's cold white hand is like the snow\nLaid softly on the furrowed hill,\nIt hides the broken seams below,\nAnd leaves the summit brighter still.\n\nIn vain the envious tongue upbraids;\nHis name a nation's heart shall keep\nTill morning's latest sunlight fades\nOn the blue tablet of the deep."}
