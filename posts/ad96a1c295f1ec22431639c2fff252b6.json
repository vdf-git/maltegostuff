{"subject": "When the Clouds Roll In", "text": "On this new day the sky is mad \r\ndarkness seems to doom all man. \r\nThe clouds far up away from this land, \r\nall of life seems to have ran. \r\n\r\nSoaring along with the mourning lark, \r\nwhile all the world is shrouded in dark. \r\nThrough the door my spirit flies, \r\nand up unto the Heaven's high."}
