{"subject": "The Tryphena's Extra Hand", "text": "In the clipper ship \nTryphena\n\nSwingin' nor'ard from the Line, \nWith the Trade wind blowin' steady \nAnd her flyin' kites ashine, \nFive and sixty days from Anjer \nWith her freight of Foochow teas, \nThere a sailorman lay dying, \nAnd the words he spoke were these:\n\n'Many a year I've knowed this packet, \nAnd I've got to like her well, \nAnd I've not much hopes of heaven \nAnd I've not much use for hell: \nBut if so be as they'll let me, \nBy the great hook-block I swear, \nWhen the old \nTryphena\nwants me,\nDead as living I'll be there.'\n\nThere'll be one more at the halyards, \nThere'll be one on the yard \nFisting down them thundering courses \nWhen they're frosted good and hard, \nOne more tallying on the forebrace \nWhen the waist's neck deep in foam, \nOne more hand to sweat the tops'ls up \nAnd sheet t'ga'n's'ls home.\n\nSo, just off the Western Islands, \nWhen he smelt the land he died, \nAnd they laid aback the main y'rd \nAnd they dropped him overside, \nThen they squared away for England, \nPulley-hauling with a will, \nBut, for all they thought they'd left him there, \nHe sailed aboard her still.\n\nAnd the chaps as was his shipmates \nWent the way as all chaps go, \nAnd the folks as was her owners \nSold the old ship long ago, \nBut whoever owned or sold her, \nAnd whoever went or came, \nThe \nTryphena's\nextra hand \nHe sailed aboard her just the same.\n\nAnd he never signed no Articles, \nHe never drawed no pay, \nHe never scoffed no vittles, \nBut by night as well as day, \nThough you'd never know his coming,\nNor you'd never see him go, \nHe'd be always somewheres handy \nAnd it comin' on to blow.\n\nAnd he'd stand by wheel and lookout, \nAnd you'd kind o' feel him near, \nKind o' see him and not see him, \nKind o' hear him and not hear, \nAnd the funny thing about it \nWas you somehow couldn't swear \n(Though you knew it sure as shooting) \nWhen the Extra Hand was there.\n\nAnd in port, when all the chaps had gone \nAshore to take their ease, \nAnd left the ship as lonely \nAnd as quiet as you please, \nNot a blessed soul aboard her \nBut the galley cat and you, \nThen you'd hear a sort o' something - \nMore than once I've heard it too.\n\nLike a feller up aloft there, \nPuttering round among the gear, \nSeizing there another ratline, \nPutting on a mousing here, \nAnd rum-tumming old tunes over \nSuch as shell backs used to know \nIn the good old China tea trade, \nMany and many a year ago."}
