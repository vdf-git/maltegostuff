{"subject": "The Immaculate Descent", "text": "The God refuses to accept\nthe infant universe.\nAfter the elusive cues, there were\nantique radiations to prove\nthat there was a diplomatic suicide.\n\nA bit of grass, \nsome moon, little water \nof eyes, the eternal embrace and \nlife starts earnestly in the \nqualms of terror.\n\nWashed out on the shores, comes \nthe body of liberty. The blood caked\nlimbs will tell you the tale\nof tribal instinct, of mankind to\ndestroy the self, the\nvessel and the sea."}
