{"subject": "By Chance", "text": "Of you, my first glance;\n Was the essence of desire;\n My heart filled with fire;\n This was only by chance.\n A deep-seated need, your eyes impart;\n To me in every possible way;l\n Knowing this was a very special day;\n To discover your work of fine art.\n Moments to treasure, upon your face;\n Signaling me so loud and clear;\n Making me know you are really sincere;\n In luring me over to your place.\n This was only be chance, we both knew.\n Seconds, minutes, and hours would pass;\n Feeling so right; hoping it to last.\n By chance, our love grew and grew."}
