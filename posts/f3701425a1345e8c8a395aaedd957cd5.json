{"subject": "In The Shadow Of The Beeches", "text": "In the shadow of the beeches,\nWhere the fragile wildflowers bloom;\nWhere the pensive silence pleaches\nGreen a roof of cool perfume,\nHave you felt an awe imperious\nAs when, in a church, mysterious\nWindows paint with God the gloom?\n\nIn the shadow of the beeches,\nWhere the rock-ledged waters flow;\nWhere the sun's slant splendor bleaches\nEvery wave to foaming snow,\nHave you felt a music solemn\nAs when minster arch and column\nEcho organ worship low?\n\nIn the shadow of the beeches,\nWhere the light and shade are blent;\nWhere the forest bird beseeches,\nAnd the breeze is brimmed with scent,-\nIs it joy or melancholy\nThat o'erwhelms us partly, wholly,\nTo our spirit's betterment?\n\nIn the shadow of the beeches\nLay me where no eye perceives;\nWhere,-like some great arm that reaches\nGently as a love that grieves,-\nOne gnarled root may clasp me kindly,\nWhile the long years, working blindly,\nSlowly change my dust to leaves."}
