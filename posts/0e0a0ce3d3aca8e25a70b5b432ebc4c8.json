{"subject": "Departure", "text": "IT was not when I plead with her,\nAnd on a tragic day\nClung sobbing to her skirts of rose,\nThat Youth went away; \n\nO not when from the cruel glass\nMy face showed, lined and chill\u2013\nHer eyes burnt wild beneath the mask,\nHer pulse hurt me still. \n\nBut when I saw young lovers pass,\nAnd watched them, well-content,\nNor felt my eyes grow hot with tears\nTo gaze where they went . . . \n\nO then I knew my time was through,\nAnd pleasured in the day,\nAt peace to know of Love and Spring\nAnd Youth gone away."}
