{"subject": "Insomnia", "text": "Between yesterday and tomorrow \nI ride \nthis mare that doesn't belong \nto me, a mare I don't comb\nor feed. \nShe's a stranger to me, \nfrom somewhere other than this city, \nand we share no common memories, \nbut she's kept me on her back by force \nall the night that's gone by \nand the day not quite ready to come.\n        The dream spat me out \n        with vigor \n        with venom \n        the way you'd spit out a fruit pit \n        or an unwanted child.\nAnd I arrived here on this horse's glossy back \nwhere I slide \nas if on mud \nbut don't fall.\nThe night clings to me, \nit's a breeze with little teeth \nthat sink into my skin and remain there. \nThe pain's mild, but it continues on and on. \nMy heels don't yet stick in the asphalt, \nthe trams don't slice the cold air, \ntomorrow's facts still are ripening, \nthey're draped beneath big bed sheets, \nexhibits that have never opened.\n\nAt night, salamis are removed from the shop window \nand stored in a secret location. \nAt night, the world and its salami slices \nare moved elsewhere.\nThe same with the pastries that are my soul. \nI too have to be in another place \u2014my body\u2014an empty carcass \na shop window emptied every evening,\na container no one \nabsolutely no one \nwants to steal.\n\nBut the dream spat me out. \nI'm here \nbetween the day that was and the one still to come. \nThe dream spat me out \nlike a hard, bitter pit. \nLet it be. \nIt was an ugly dream. \nOr I was the ugly one. \nBetween yesterday and tomorrow is a narrow space \nas between the dresser and the wall. \nI stand with my back \nto yesterday's sun, \nto yesterday's fear,\n face to face with something that doesn't yet want to open. \nOn this horse's slick back until \nthe trams, the heels, the workers get a green light \nand start going.\n\nTranslation from Romanian by Claudia Serea"}
