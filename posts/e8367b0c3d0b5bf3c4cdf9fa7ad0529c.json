{"subject": "Maternity", "text": "There once was a Square, such a square little Square,\nAnd he loved a trim Triangle;\nBut she was a flirt and around her skirt\nVainly she made him dangle.\nOh he wanted to wed and he had no dread\nOf domestic woes and wrangles;\nFor he thought that his fate was to procreate\nCute little Squares and Triangles.\n\nNow it happened one day on that geometric way\nThere swaggered a big bold Cube.\nWith a haughty stare and he made that Square\nHave the air of a perfect boob;\nTo his solid spell the Triangle fell,\nAnd she thrilled with love's sweet sickness,\nFor she took delight in his breadth and height -\nBut how she adored his thickness!\n\nSo that poor little Square just died of despair,\nFor his love he could not strangle;\nWhile the bold Cube led to the bridal bed\nThat cute and acute Triangle.\nThe Square's sad lot she has long forgot,\nAnd his passionate pretensions . . .\nFor she dotes on her kids-Oh such cute Pyramids\nIn a world of three dimensions."}
