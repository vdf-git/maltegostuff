{"subject": "On a Painting of Cynaegirus", "text": "The hands that dealt death to the Medes\nWere hewn off by axes as they rested\nOn the curved stern of the ship \nWhich was hastening away,\nThen, Cynaegirus,\nWhen that flying vessel was held\nBy thy hand\nAs if by a cable.\nBut even so,\nGripping tight the ship's timber,\nThey accompanied the Persians,\nA lifeless terror to them.\nSome barbarian took the hands,\nBut their victory remained\nWith the inhabitants of Mopsopia.\n\ntranslated by William Roger Paton"}
