{"subject": "Fate (Savitri, Part Two, Book Seven)", "text": "Fate followed her foreseen immutable road.\nMan's hopes and longings build the journeying wheels\nThat bear the body of his destiny\nAnd lead his blind will towards an unknown goal.\nHis fate within him shapes his acts and rules;\nIts face and form already are born in him,\nIts parentage is in his secret soul:\nHere Matter seems to mould the body's life\nAnd the soul follows where its nature drives.\nNature and Fate compel his free-will's choice.\nBut greater spirits this balance can reverse\nAnd make the soul the artist of its fate.\nThis is the mystic truth our ignorance hides:"}
