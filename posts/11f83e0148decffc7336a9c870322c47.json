{"subject": "On My Sister Joanna's Entrance Into Her 33rd Year", "text": "On this thy natal day permit a friend -\nA brother - with thy joys his own to blend:\nIn all gladness he would wish to share\nAs willing in thy griefs a part to bear. \n\nMeekly attend the ways of higher heav'n!\nIs much deny'd? Yet much my dear is giv'n.\nThy health, thy reason unimpaired remain\nAnd while as new fal'n snows thy spotless fame\nThe partner of thy life, attentive - kind -\nAnd blending e'en the interests of the mind. \n\nWhat bliss is thine when fore thy glistring eye\nThy lovely infant train pass jocund by!\nThe ruddy cheek, the smiling morning face\nDenote a healthy undegenerate race:\nIn them renew'd, you'll live and live again,\nAnd children's children's children lisp thy name. \nBright be the skies where'er my sister goes\nNor scowling tempests injure her repose -\nThe field of life with roses thick be strow'd\nNor one sharp thorn lie lurking in the road.\nThy ev'ry path be still a path of peace\nAnd each revolving year thy joys increase;\nTill hours and years of time itself be o'er\nAnd one eternal day around thee pour."}
