{"subject": "The Republican Genius Of Europe", "text": "Emporers and kings! in vain you strive\nYour torments to conceal--\nThe age is come that shakes your thrones,\nTramples in dust despotic crowns,\nAnd bids the sceptre fail.\n\nIn western worlds the flame began:\nFrom thence to France it flew--\nThrough Europe, now, it takes its way,\nBeams an insufferable day,\nAnd lays all tyrants low.\n\nGenius fo France! pursue the chace\nTill Reason's laws restore\nMan to be Man, in every clime;--\nThat Being, active, great, sublime\nDebas'd in dust no more.\n\nIn dreadful pomp he takes his way\nO'er ruin'd crowns, demolish'd thrones--\nPale tyrants shrink before his blaze--\nRound him terrific lightenings play--\nWith eyes of fire, he looks then through,\nCrushes the vile despotic crew,\nAnd Pride in ruin lays."}
