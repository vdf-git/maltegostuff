{"subject": "Caleb's Vision", "text": "Caleb went, as was his custom,\nOn a quiet Sunday morn,\nTo the house of prayer and worship,\nThither by devotion borne.\nWith his heart to Heaven uplifted,\nAll his soul engaged in prayer,\nCaleb in his inmost being\nFelt God's gracious presence there.\nRose the organ's diapason,\nDeep, majestical and wild,\nAnd the singers sang a chorus\nTo the praise of Mary's child.\nSoon the song to silence melted,\nDied the organ-tones away,\nAnd the pastor in the pulpit\nSaid in low voice, 'Let us pray!'\nIn most earnest supplication\nThen the good man's voice uprose,\nFor a world in darkness lying,\nFor its wickedness and woes,\nAll by one man's sin engendered,\nAll by Adam's fatal fall,\nWhich, the pastor said, hath all men\nWrapped within its fearful pall.\nWhen the pastor ceased his praying,\nIn the pulpit stood up one\nWhose high brow with care was furrowed,\nDarkened by an Orient sun,\nAnd he told, in strains pathetic,\nOf a distant eastern clime,\nWhere, by superstition fettered,\nSunk in ignorance and crime,\nAll the people worshiped idols,\nGods which their own hands had made,\nVainly thinking, in their blindness,\nEarth-born gods could give them aid.\nAnd as Caleb heard the story\nAll his heart within him burned,\nAnd his soul with deep compassion\nFor that wretched people yearned.\nNow before his spirit's vision\nThese sad scenes began to glide:\nMothers their own children casting\nHeadlong 'neath the rolling tide\nOf the Ganges, monster haunted,\nCounting love maternal naught;\nNature's holiest instincts vanquished\nBy the faith which they are taught.\nMultitudes, self-immolating,\nDeeming their salvation bought\nBy a death beneath the pond'rous\nWheels of gory Juggernaut.\nOn the funeral-pyre, the widow,\nLying down beside the dead,\nWhile the red flames, hot and savage,\nLeap in fury overhead.\nAge defenceless, left to perish\nOn the altar-river's bank,\nMid dark vapors thence uprising,\nWith foul, poisonous odors rank;\nNo kind friend to sit beside them,\nOr to close the glazing eye;\nNaught save the cold stars above them,\nKeeping watch, as thus they die.\nStifled cry of drowning infant,\nBleeding victim's dying groan,\nPiercing shriek of burning widow,\nAge's low expiring moan,\nWith a strange and untold horror\nAll his spirit overcast,\nAs the dreadful panorama\nRolled in sad distinctness past.\n'Neither gold nor silver have I,\nBut myself to them I give;\nI will bear to them the Gospel,\nThat they, hearing it, may live.'\nSuch was Caleb's earnest answer\nTo the preacher's solemn call\nOn the worshipers of Him who\nSaid, 'My gospel preach to all.'\nHomeward Caleb went, still burning\nWith a new and holy fire;\nThe salvation of the heathen\nHis most ardent, sole desire.\nHaving first himself committed\nTo the Great All-Father's care,\nAnd his consecration offered,\nAll his purposes laid bare,\nOn his peaceful couch lay Caleb,\nIn a quiet slumber bound,\nWhen had Night her jeweled curtain\nDrawn the weary earth around;\nAnd a vision was vouchsafed him;\nStood an angel by his bed,\nClothed in robes of spotless beauty,\nRadiance streaming from his head;\nAnd he spake in accents softer\nThan the south wind's gentlest sigh,\n'Fear not, Caleb, I am sent thee\nFrom the Lord who rules on High,\n'Sent to say thy consecration\nAnd thy vows have all been heard;\nHe doth graciously accept them,\nIn His book they're registered.\n'Go, on God's own strength relying,\nRaise Immanuel's standard high,\nTeach the poor, benighted millions\nHow to live and how to die.\n'Tell them of God's great compassion;\nOf His tender heart which yearns\nLike a mother's o'er her children;\nOf His love which brightly burns\n'With a steady flame, undying,\nWith an energy divine,\nSeeking all the lost and ruined,\nWho in sin and misery pine.\n'Tell them of His incarnation,\nOf His earthly life and loss,\nHow for them He greatly suffered,\nHow for them He bore the cross.\n'Be thou faithful to the message,\nShrink not, fear not, though thou be\nOften weary of thy life-work,\nThink what Christ hath done for thee.\n'In His strength go forward boldly,\nBear the banner of the Cross,\nAnd its victories shall surely\nCompensate thy every loss.\n'And thy soul's most ardent wishes\nShall be more than satisfied,\nIn the hosts who heed thy message\nAnd accept the Crucified.\n'And when thou thy task hast finished,\nWhen thy earthly work is o'er,\nHeaven its doors shall open to thee, - \nThine its joys for evermore!'"}
