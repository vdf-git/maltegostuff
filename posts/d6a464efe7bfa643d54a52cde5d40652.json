{"subject": "Sonnet Xxx: When To The Sessions Of Sweet Silent Thought", "text": "When to the sessions of sweet silent thought\nI summon up remembrance of things past,\nI sigh the lack of many a thing I sought,\nAnd with old woes new wail my dear times' waste;\nThen can I drown an eye, unus'd to flow,\nFor precious friends hid in death's dateless night,\nAnd weep afresh love's long since cancell'd woe,\nAnd moan the expense of many a vanish'd sight:\nThen can I grieve at grievances foregone,\nAnd heavily from woe to woe tell o'er\nThe sad account of fore-bemoan\u00e9d moan,\nWhich I new pay as if not paid before.\nBut if the while I think on thee, dear friend,\nAll losses are restor'd and sorrows end."}
