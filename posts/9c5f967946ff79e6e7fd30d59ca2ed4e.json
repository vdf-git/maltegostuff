{"subject": "We Two", "text": "A cabin, a porch, two old rocking chairs \nSome work to do but nobody cares.  \nA man and his wife sit holding hands,  \nTalking over their well laid plans.  The toil, the work is now all done,  \nAnd they have planned to have some fun.  \nThey have scrimped and saved, even delayed \nThe time n their lives they would have played.  The old chairs creak as they rock to and fro,  \nThe man smokes his pipe as his wife sits and sews.  \nThey stop a moment, take a breath of clean air \nAnd they settle back in their old rocking chairs.  Their friends stop by to see time spent,  \nBy the two old people who seem so content.  \nThey can't understand how we two could be \nSo peaceful and happy, just you and me.  We worked, we laughed and saved and prayed,  \nGod's call for us would be delayed.  \nWe wanted some years to have some fun \nAnd love them under the mountain sun.  We're happy and content as you can see,  \nTwo old rocking chairs, you and me.  \nGod gave us each other and His love besides,  \nAnd we'll walk down life's pathway with Him at our sides."}
