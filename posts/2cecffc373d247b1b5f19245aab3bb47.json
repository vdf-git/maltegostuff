{"subject": "Living In The Body", "text": "Body is something you need in order to stay\non this planet and you only get one.\nAnd no matter which one you get, it will not\nbe satisfactory. It will not be beautiful\nenough, it will not be fast enough, it will\nnot keep on for days at a time, but will\npull you down into a sleepy swamp and\ndemand apples and coffee and chocolate cake.\n\nBody is a thing you have to carry\nfrom one day into the next. Always the\nsame eyebrows over the same eyes in the same\nskin when you look in the mirror, and the\nsame creaky knee when you get up from the\nfloor and the same wrist under the watchband.\nThe changes you can make are small and\ncostly\u2014better to leave it as it is.\n\nBody is a thing that you have to leave\neventually. You know that because you have\nseen others do it, others who were once like you,\nliving inside their pile of bones and\nflesh, smiling at you, loving you,\nleaning in the doorway, talking to you\nfor hours and then one day they\nare gone.
