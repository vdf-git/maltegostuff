{"subject": "Consequences", "text": "I. Of Choice\nDespair is big with friends I love,\nHydrogen and burning jews.\nI give them all the grief I have\nBut I tell them, friends, I choose, I choose,\n\nDon\u2019t make me say against my glands\nOr how the world has treated me.\nThough gay and modest give offense\nAnd people grieve pretentiously,\n\nMore than I hoped to do, I do\nAnd more than I deserve I get;\nWhat little I attend, I know\nAnd it argues order more than not.\n\nMy desperate friends, I want to tell\nThem, you take too delicate offense\nAt the stench of time and man\u2019s own smell,\nIt is only the smell of consequence.\n\nII. Of Love\nPeople love each other and the light\nOf love gilds but doesn\u2019t alter,\nPeople don\u2019t change one another, can scarcely\nBy taking will and thought add a little\nNow and then to their own statures\nWhich, praise them, they do,\nSo that here we are in all our sizes\nFlooded in the impartial daylight sometimes,\nSpotted sometimes in a light we make ourselves,\nHuman, the beams of attention\nOf social animals at their work\nWhich is loving; and sometimes all dark.\n\nThe only correction is\nBy you of you, by me of me.\nPeople are worth looking at in this light\nAnd if you listen what they are saying is,\nLove me sun out there whoever you are,\nChasing me from bed in the morning,\nSpooking me all day with shadow,\nSurprising me whenever you fall;\nMake me conspicuous as I go here,\nSpotted by however many beams,\nNow light, finally dark. I fear\nThere is meant to be a lot of darkness,\nYou hear them say, but every last creature\nIs the one it meant to be.\n\nIII. My Acts\nThe acts of my life swarm down the street like Puerto Rican kids,\nForeign but small and, except for one, unknived.\nThey do no harm though their voices slash like reeds;\nAll except one they have evidently been loved.\n\nAnd down the hill where I\u2019ve planted spruce and red pine\nIn a gang of spiked shadows they slouch at night.\nI am reasonably brave. I have been, except on one occasion,\nMyself: it is no good trying to be what you are not.\n\nWe live among gangs who seem to have no stake\nIn what we\u2019re trying to do, no sense of property or race,\nYet if you speak with authority they will halt and break\nAnd sullenly, one by one, show you a local face.\n\nI dreamt once that they caught me and, holding me down,\nBurned my genitals with gasoline;\nIn my stupid terror I was telling them names\nSo my manhood kept and the rest went up in flames.\n\n\u2018Now, say the world is a fair place,\u2019 the biggest one said,\nAnd because there was no face worse than my own there\nI said it and got up. Quite a lot of me is charred.\nBy our code it is fair. We play fair. The world is fair."}
