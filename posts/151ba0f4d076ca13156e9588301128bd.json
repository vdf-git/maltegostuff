{"subject": "Through The Nose", "text": "I have seen you in a dream\nrunning towards me\nsurprised and pleased\nto have found me again,\nand I was as happy\nthough I felt\nthat I was\npersuaded by the deceit\nand that the ecstasy\nwas especially my own.\nAnd in the crystal\nof my vision\nthrough the nose\nI have meanwhile\nkissed you against a yellow wall\nholding your perfume in my arms.\nI woke up in a sweat\nand throughout the day\nI was filled with desire\nand burning inside,\nhappy to remain\nroasting in that oven.\n\nTranslated by Boris Peters"}
