{"subject": "How Things Work", "text": "Today it's going to cost us twenty dollars\nTo live. Five for a softball. Four for a book,\nA handful of ones for coffee and two sweet rolls,\nBus fare, rosin for your mother's violin.\nWe're completing our task. The tip I left\nFor the waitress filters down\nLike rain, wetting the new roots of a child\nPerhaps, a belligerent cat that won't let go\nOf a balled sock until there's chicken to eat.\nAs far as I can tell, daughter, it works like this:\nYou buy bread from a grocery, a bag of apples\nFrom a fruit stand, and what coins\nAre passed on helps others buy pencils, glue,\nTickets to a movie in which laughter\nIs thrown into their faces.\nIf we buy a goldfish, someone tries on a hat.\nIf we buy crayons, someone walks home with a broom.\nA tip, a small purchase here and there,\nAnd things just keep going. I guess."}
