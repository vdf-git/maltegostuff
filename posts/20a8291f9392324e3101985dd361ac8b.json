{"subject": "Tasso", "text": "All pale by the dungeon door he stands,\n His own sweet sky above,\nAnd he holds a book in his trembling hands,\n The labour of years and love.\nAnd, lo, as he opens that single book,\n As if by some holy ray,\nThe dungeon shadows grow pale in look\n And forever pass away.\nThey pass away from the dull, drear cell\n To give place to a spirit sweet,\nWho paces its floor as the ages swell\n With sweetly sounding feet.\nAnd wherever their sound has the power to reach,\n They come of the kindred mind\nLike pilgrims to hear that spirit preach\n Which the poet has left behind.\nFrom many a distant and colder land\n They come and in silence look,\nAnd see by the dungeon the poet stand\n Still clasping that single book.\nThey enter in, and the cell grows bright\n As the wings of the cherubim,\nWhile the footsteps grow soft, and sweet, and light,\n Like leaves at their evening hymn.\nThey bow, and their spirit is not alone,\n For swift from the calm past years\nThe dead man's being strikes full on their own,\n And their heart grows big with tears.\nO wonderful unseen power that still\n As the ages roll along\nHeaps scorn on the tyrant's might and will,\n But deifies endless song."}
