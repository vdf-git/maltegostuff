{"subject": "Michaelangelo", "text": "Would I might wake in you the whirl-wind soul \nOf Michelangelo, who hewed the stone \nAnd Night and Day revealed, whose arm alone \nCould draw the face of God, the titan high \nWhose genius smote like lightning from the sky \u2014 \nAnd shall he mold like dead leaves in the grave? \nNay he is in us! Let us dare and dare. \nGod help us to be brave."}
