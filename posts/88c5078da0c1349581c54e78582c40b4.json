{"subject": "Air", "text": "I often thought there was a soul\nUpon the zephyr's wing,\nUpon the zephyr's wing,\nAnd oft I thought it seem'd to sigh\nAs near me hovering,\nSo tenderly,\nSo piteously.\nIts balmy breath\nWas breathed on me,\nThat oft I thought there was a soul\nUpon the zephyr's wing.\n\nIt might not be that spirit bland,\nWas near me hovering.\nWas near me hovering.\nBut I was glad to think him there,\nFor I was sorrowing\u2014\nSo hopelessly.\nWith love for thee\nAnd tenderly.\nIt sigh'd with me,\nAjid thus I thought there was a soul\nUpon the zephyr's wing."}
