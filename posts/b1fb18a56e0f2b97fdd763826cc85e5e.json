{"subject": "America My Country", "text": "It's great to live in a country big and strong \nIt doesn't matter if you are young or old \nOur thoughts are as good as gold \nWhere we go on land or sea \nWe can always be happy and free \nFree to express our thoughts and then \nEven express them over again \nTo different people no matter what color or race \nIn America for them there is always a place \nTo make a home \nFor their families to roam \nThe fields; the woods. \nThe countryside \nEspecially the young man and his bride \nFor seniors and teens \nIn formals or jeans \nWho ever it may be \nRemember we can always be free \nJust like a bird chirping, singing happily. \nLike chipmunks in the wood \nCalling to his mate and being good. \nGood to his family  \nAnd Grandpa talking to his Emily \nPondering over ideas and thoughts galore \nAnd, off to bed and listen to him snore \nTaken up in the morning early light \nWhenever it is nice and bright \nIn America where we are always free \nWhere in New York Harbor stands the Statue of Liberty \nHer hand raised high toward the sky \nWhere our planes in freedom fly \nWhere all of us want to be \nAmerica for you and me \nLiberty and freedom will never end \nI'll get down on both my knees and bend \nTo thank God I am an American \nIn a country great and grand \nWho wants to be anywhere else \nExcept in America where we can do so much expand \nAmerica will always be my land."}
