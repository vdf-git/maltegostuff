{"subject": "The Tombs Of The Regicides", "text": "LUDLOW AND BROUGHTON \n\nALONE on the vine-covered hillside, \nSet gray 'gainst the ivy-clad walnuts, \nStands, sombre as Calvin, and barren \nOf crucifix, altar, and picture, \nThe church of St. Martin. A stranger, \nI stood where the pride of its arches \nLooks scorn on the Puritan's sadness. \nNot prouder for Switzerland's annals. \nThe glory of Morat or Sempach \nThan these darkened tablets that tell us \nHow gladly for Ludlow and Broughton \nShe lifted the shield of protection,. \nHow sternly she answered the summons \nTo render her guests to the headsman. \nThe parents that gave their true soul-life \nWere England and Freedom. Ah, surely \nWith courage and conscience they honored \nThat parentage costly of sorrow, \nAnd did the just deed and abided. \nLong, long were the days that God gave them \nWith friendships and peace in this refuge, \nWhere sadly they yearned for the home-land, \nAnd saw their great Oliver's England \nBowed low in the dust of dishonor."}
