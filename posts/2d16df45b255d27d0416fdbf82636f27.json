{"subject": "Lords Of The Visionary Eye", "text": "I CAME upon a pool that shone,\nClear, emerald-like, among the hills,\nThat seemed old wizards round a stone\nOf magic that a vision thrills.\nAnd as I leaned and looked, it seemed\nVague shadows gathered there and here \u2014\nA dream, perhaps the water dreamed\nOf some wild past, some long-dead year\u2026.\nA temple of a race unblessed \nRose huge within a hollow land,\nWhere, on an altar, bare of breast,\nOne lay, a man, bound foot and hand.\nA priest, who served some hideous god,\nStood near him on the altar stair,\nClothed on with gold; and at his nod\nA multitude seemed gathered there.\nI saw a sword descend; and then\nThe priest before the altar turned;\nHe was not formed like mortal man,\nBut like a beast whose eyeballs burned.\nAmorphous, strangely old, he glared\nAbove the victim he had slain,\nWho lay with bleeding bosom bared,\nFrom which dripped slow a crimson rain.\nThen turned to me a face of stone\nAnd mocked above the murdered dead,\nThat fixed its cold eyes on his own\nAnd cursed him with a look of dread.\nAnd then, it seemed, I knew the place,\nAnd how this sacrifice befell:\nI knew the god, the priest's wild face,\nI knew the dead man \u2014 knew him well.\nAnd as I stooped again to look,\nI heard the dark hills sigh and laugh,\nAnd in the pool the water shook\nAs if one stirred it with a staff.\nAnd all was still again and clear:\nThe pool lay crystal as before,\nTemple and priest were gone; the mere\nHad closed again its magic door.\nA face was there; it seemed to shine\nAs round it died the sunset's flame \u2014\nThe victim's face?\u2014 or was it mine?\u2014\nThey were to me the very same.\nAnd yet, and yet \u2014 could this thing be? \u2014\nAnd in my soul I seemed to know,\nAt once, this was a memory\nOf some past life, lived long ago.\nRecorded by some secret sense,\nIn forms that we as dreams retain;\nSome moment, as experience,\nProjects in pictures on the brain."}
