{"subject": "To The Duchess Of Ferrara", "text": "Royal bride, see the time advance\nThat calls true lovers to the dance,\nTo charm the clear and frosty nights,\nBeneath the soft and pleasing lights.\nNow a young girl dares to hear,\nLove\u2019s secret pain, in her chaste ear,\nAnd leaves her lover uncertain, gently,\nAt war, with life and death, sweetly. \nGreat palaces, painted ceilings high,\nEcho with song: only I weeping make\nThis dark prison ring. And is this then\nYour loyalty? This the great gift, that I\nSo longed for? Ah, then you call a grave,\nAnd prison, your pity, and your recompense?"}
