{"subject": "At Evening Time There Shall Be Light", "text": "THE day was wild with wind and rain, \nOne grey wrapped sky and sea and shore, \nIt seemed our marsh would never again \nWear the rich robes that once it wore. \nThe scattered farms looked sad and chill, \nTheir sheltering trees writhed all awry, \nAnd waves of mist broke on the hill \nWhere once the great sea thundered by. \nThen God remembered this His land, \nThis little land that is our own, \nHe caught the rain up in His hand, \nHe hid the winds behind His throne, \nHe soothed the fretful waves to rest, \nHe called the clouds to come away, \nAnd, by blue pathways, to the west, \nThey went, like children tired of play.\nAnd then God bade our marsh put on \nIts holy vestment of fine gold; \nFrom marge to marge the glory shone \nOn lichened farm and fence and fold; \nIn the gold sky that walled the west, \nIn each transfigured stone and tree, \nThe glory of God was manifest, \nPlain for a little child to see!"}
