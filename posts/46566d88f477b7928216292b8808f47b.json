{"subject": "Sonnet Written After Having Read A. F. Rio\u2019s, Petite Chouaunerie -", "text": "Call not our Bretons backward. What if rude\nOf speech and mien, and rude of fashion\u2014drest;\nYet dwells firm faith beneath each simple vest;\nWith valiant heart, that scorns all servitude,\nBut to the Right. When France's fickler blood\nCrouch'd to the crown\u00ebd pageant of the day,\nNew-fangled homage These disdained to pay;\nBut kept old vows in truth and hardihood.\nAnd with no surface-glare, no facet-light,\nBut the rich inward lustre of the gem,\nWhen tried in shade, were yet more deeply bright.\nAnd therefore, Traveller! call not backward\u2014Them,\nFound never yet, in worst extremity,\nBackward to bear\u2014nor backward when to die."}
