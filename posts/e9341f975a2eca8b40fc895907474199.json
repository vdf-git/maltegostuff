{"subject": "Worth While", "text": "He doesn't care that I'm not rich, \nOr that I'm poorly dressed, \nThat I'm a toiler in the ditch \nHe hasn't even guessed. \nMy faults that other people know \nHe doesn't even see, \nFor every night with eyes aglow \nHe toddles up to me. \n\nAlthough I'm just a common dub,\nAnd ordinary clay, \nHis cheek to mine he's glad to rub \nBefore I go away; \nAnd every night when I return, \nHe's glad as he can be, \nAnd though but little I may earn \nHe toddles up to me.\n\nTo come to me he'd leave a king,\nIf one were sitting near, \nUnto no millionaire he'd cling\nIf only I'd appear. \nAnd though but tattered rags are mine\nWhen I go home to tea \nWith eyes that fairly beam and shine\nHe'd toddle up to me.\n\nAnd so I've reason to be glad,\nAnd reason to rejoice, \nIt's worth the world to be a dad, \nTo be a baby's choice. \nThere is no prize fame can bestow, \nNo joy can ever be \nSo real, as when, with eyes aglow, \nHe toddles up to me."}
