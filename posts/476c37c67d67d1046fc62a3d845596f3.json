{"subject": "To A Lady Asking Foolish Questions", "text": "Why am I sorry, Chloe? Because the moon is far:\nAnd who am I to be straitened in a little earthly star?\n\nBecause thy face is fair? And what if it had not been,\nThe fairest face of all is the face I have not seen.\n\nBecause the land is cold, and however I scheme and plot,\nI cannot find a ferry to the land where I am not.\n\nBecause thy lips are red and thy breasts upbraid the snow?\n(There is neither white nor red in the pleasance where I go.)\n\nBecause thy lips grow pale and thy breasts grow dun and fall?\nI go where the wind blows, Chloe, and am not sorry at all."}
