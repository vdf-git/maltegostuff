{"subject": "Summer Evening At Home", "text": "Come, lovely Evening! with thy smile of peace\nVisit my humble dwelling; welcomed in,\nNot with loud shouts, and the thronged city's din,\nBut with such sounds as bid all tumult cease\nOf the sick heart; the grasshopper's faint pipe\nBeneath the blades of dewy grass unripe,\nThe bleat of the lone lamb, the carol rude\nHeard indistinctly from the village green,\nThe bird's last twitter, from the hedge-row seen,\nWhere, just before, the scattered crumbs I strewed,\nTo pay him for his farewell song;--all these\nTouch soothingly the troubled ear, and please\nThe stilly-stirring fancies. Though my hours\n(For I have drooped beneath life's early showers)\nPass lonely oft, and oft my heart is sad,\nYet I can leave the world, and feel most glad\nTo meet thee, Evening, here; here my own hand\nHas decked with trees and shrubs the slopes around,\nAnd whilst the leaves by dying airs are fanned,\nSweet to my spirit comes the farewell sound,\nThat seems to say: Forget the transient tear\nThy pale youth shed--Repose and Peace are here."}
