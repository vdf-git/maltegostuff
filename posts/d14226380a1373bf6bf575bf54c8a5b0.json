{"subject": "Clouds", "text": "Laughter and song for my cheer,\nLife is so fair.\nNone so happy as I\nAnywhere;\nBirds in the woods carol clear,\nWhite clouds in the sky.\nSong silent and brow with a frown,\nWhy is this so?\nGuiltless am I\nWould you know,\nThe lark from the heavens drops down;\nGrey clouds in the sky.\nSighing and tears for my sorrow,\nLife is so drear,\nNone so weary as I,\n'Tis a mere\nWaste of love, and a wish for to-morrow\u2014\nBlack night in the sky."}
