{"subject": "Encounter", "text": "We were riding through frozen fields in a wagon at dawn.\nA red wing rose in the darkness.\n\nAnd suddenly a hare ran across the road.\nOne of us pointed to it with his hand.\n\nThat was long ago.Today neither of them is alive,\nNot the hare, nor the man who made the gesture.\n\nO my love, where are they, where are they going\nThe flash of a hand, streak of movement, rustle of pebbles.\nI ask not out of sorrow, but in wonder."}
