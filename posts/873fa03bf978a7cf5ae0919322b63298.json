{"subject": "Initial Love", "text": "Venus, when her son was lost,\nCried him up and down the coast,\nIn hamlets, palaces, and parks,\nAnd told the truant by his marks,\nGolden curls, and quiver, and bow;\u2014\nThis befell long ago.\nTime and tide are strangely changed,\nMen and manners much deranged;\nNone will now find Cupid latent\nBy this foolish antique patent.\nHe came late along the waste,\nShod like a traveller for haste,\nWith malice dared me to proclaim him,\nThat the maids and boys might name him.\n\nBoy no more, he wears all coats,\nFrocks, and blouses, capes, cap\u00f4tes,\nHe bears no bow, or quiver, or wand,\nNor chaplet on his head or hand:\nLeave his weeds and heed his eyes,\nAll the rest he can disguise.\nIn the pit of his eyes a spark\nWould bring back day if it were dark,\nAnd,\u2014if I tell you all my thought,\nThough I comprehend it not,\u2014\nIn those unfathomable orbs\nEvery function he absorbs;\nHe doth eat, and drink, and fish, and shoot,\nAnd write, and reason, and compute,\nAnd ride, and run, and have, and hold,\nAnd whine, and flatter, and regret,\nAnd kiss, and couple, and beget,\nBy those roving eye-balls bold;\nUndaunted are their courages,\nRight Cossacks in their forages;\nFleeter they than any creature,\nThey are his steeds and not his feature,\nInquisitive, and fierce, and fasting,\nRestless, predatory, hasting,\u2014\nAnd they pounce on other eyes,\nAs lions on their prey;\nAnd round their circles is writ,\nPlainer than the day,\nUnderneath, within, above,\nLove, love, love, love.\nHe lives in his eyes,\nThere doth digest, and work, and spin,\nAnd buy, and sell, and lose, and win;\nHe rolls them with delighted motion,\nJoy-tides swell their mimic ocean.\nYet holds he them with tortest rein,\nThat they may seize and entertain\nThe glance that to their glance opposes,\nLike fiery honey sucked from roses.\n\nHe palmistry can understand,\nImbibing virtue by his hand\nAs if it were a living root;\nThe pulse of hands will make him mute;\nWith all his force he gathers balms\nInto those wise thrilling palms.\n\nCupid is a casuist,\nA mystic, and a cabalist,\nCan your lurking Thought surprise,\nAnd interpret your device;\nMainly versed in occult science,\nIn magic, and in clairvoyance.\nOft he keeps his fine ear strained,\nAnd reason on her tiptoe pained,\nFor aery intelligence,\nAnd for strange coincidence.\nBut it touches his quick heart\nWhen Fate by omens takes his part,\nAnd chance-dropt hints from Nature's sphere\nDeeply soothe his anxious ear.\n\nHeralds high before him run,\nHe has ushers many a one,\nSpreads his welcome where he goes,\nAnd touches all things with his rose.\nAll things wait for and divine him,\u2014\nHow shall I dare to malign him,\nOr accuse the god of sport?\u2014\nI must end my true report,\nPainting him from head to foot,\nIn as far as I took note,\nTrusting well the matchless power\nOf this young-eyed emperor\nWill clear his fame from every cloud,\nWith the bards, and with the crowd.\n\nHe is wilful, mutable,\nShy, untamed, inscrutable,\nSwifter-fashioned than the fairies,\nSubstance mixed of pure contraries,\nHis vice some elder virtue's token,\nAnd his good is evil spoken.\nFailing sometimes of his own,\nHe is headstrong and alone;\nHe affects the wood and wild,\nLike a flower-hunting child,\nBuries himself in summer waves,\nIn trees, with beasts, in mines, and caves,\nLoves nature like a horned cow,\nBird, or deer, or cariboo.\n\nShun him, nymphs, on the fleet horses!\nHe has a total world of wit,\nO how wise are his discourses!\nBut he is the arch-hypocrite,\nAnd through all science and all art,\nSeeks alone his counterpart.\nHe is a Pundit of the east,\nHe is an augur and a priest,\nAnd his soul will melt in prayer,\nBut word and wisdom are a snare;\nCorrupted by the present toy,\nHe follows joy, and only joy.\n\nThere is no mask but he will wear,\nHe invented oaths to swear,\nHe paints, he carves, he chants, he prays,\nAnd holds all stars in his embrace,\nGodlike, \u2014but 'tis for his fine pelf,\nThe social quintessence of self.\nWell, said I, he is hypocrite,\nAnd folly the end of his subtle wit,\nHe takes a sovran privilege\nNot allowed to any liege,\nFor he does go behind all law,\nAnd right into himself does draw,\nFor he is sovranly allied.\nHeaven's oldest blood flows in his side,\nAnd interchangeably at one\nWith every king on every throne,\nThat no God dare say him nay,\nOr see the fault, or seen betray;\nHe has the Muses by the heart,\nAnd the Parc\u00e6 all are of his part.\n\nHis many signs cannot be told,\nHe has not one mode, but manifold,\nMany fashions and addresses,\nPiques, reproaches, hurts, caresses,\nAction, service, badinage,\nHe will preach like a friar,\nAnd jump like Harlequin,\nHe will read like a crier,\nAnd fight like a Paladin.\nBoundless is his memory,\nPlans immense his term prolong,\nHe is not of counted age,\nMeaning always to be young.\nAnd his wish is intimacy,\nIntimater intimacy,\nAnd a stricter privacy,\nThe impossible shall yet be done,\nAnd being two shall still be one.\nAs the wave breaks to foam on shelves,\nThen runs into a wave again,\nSo lovers melt their sundered selves,\nYet melted would be twain."}
