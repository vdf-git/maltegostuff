{"subject": "The Dream", "text": "The glen of Daghestan, at noon, was hot and gleaming; \nI lay on sand with lead sent to my heart,\nMy deadly wound was deep and easily steaming;  \nAnd, drop by drop, was oozing out blood.\n\nI lay on sand of this small glen, alone;\nHigh cliffs surrounded my motionless head. \nThe sun was scorching their yellow stone\nAnd scorching me; but I was sleeping, dead.\n\nAnd I daydreamed of homeland and evening:\nA feast was glittering with celebrating lights;\nYoung women, garlanded with flowers, were sitting,\nWith gaily talk about me all night. \n\nBut one of them sat there, sunk in musing,\nNot taking part in this light-hearted talk,\nHer youthful soul, the world of real loosing,\nIn jungles of dreams sorrowfully walked.\n\nShe dreamed of Daghestan: the glen was hot and gleaming - \nAnd someone, familiar, lay on the ground, dead,\nThe fatefull wound was black and easily steaming,\nAnd cooling blood was spreading on the sand."}
