A \nmoth takes the flight\u2015 strikes \na hot teardrop shaped light bulb.\nBrick walls hold back the sea.\n\nThe rage attacks a black sun? \n\nWhy do you think of \nvanishing without a cause? \nHairless the moon cries.\n\nPink peony waits for the \nsick gods.\n\nVocal cords vibrate.\nNo vowels come out. A naked \nspeech becomes museum."}
