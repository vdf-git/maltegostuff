{"subject": "Persephone In America", "text": "Because the body is a map\nand because the map I know best\nis the one of this country, I pluck her\nfrom the pages of the book of myth\nand paste her down here,\non a page in my journal,\nin the middle of my life,\nin the middle of the country,\nwind from the end of the century\nwhistling around our face and ears.\n\nI make her walk beside a wagon to get here.\nI pick her up, like Midge or Barbie,\nand say, Listen, I know you're a goddess.\nBut those white robes won't cut it.\nI dress her the way I dressed myself\nin high school so that I can remember\nbefore it is gone - skirts\nrolled up too short, white lipstick,\nblack fishnet stockings that left\nour knees printed with diamonds.\nI teach her to hitchhike\nand take her to Woodstock,\nskin bronzed with Bain de Soleil,\nher hair streaked California blonde\nthe way my own was with Sun-In.\n\nI tell her, In this country\ngirls grow up too young, already\nworried about their weight at ten.\nBut I take her out dancing at midnight\nacross the tawny fields - the Monkey,\nthe Frug, the Swim - all the way up\nthrough break and line dancing,\nthe years humming through us\nlike a fast-forward film,\nwhile she lies down with the boys\nand men I remember, and the delicate,\npink rock roses of our bodies bloom and burn\nbut refuse to die, their petals a flag sewn\nin the shape of a woman printed with stars.\n\nI take her back. I make\nher mother die when she is young\nand hold her in my arms afterwards\nthe way I never was. I give her\na tongue, flickering like a small\ngreen flame or a sprout of corn\nin her mouth, and whisper America,\nAmerica in her ear while she sleeps.\nI snap down the faded oilskin\nMercator projection and teach her\nthe names of the states, letting her love\nCalifornia best for its Mediterranean air,\nher feet fast in a pair of red Keds\nthat carry her all the way\nfrom one coast to the other,\nwestern meadowlark purling\na goldrush in our heads,\nthe history of what the body\ncan become here as spacious\nas the sky arching above us.\n\nI tell her the pause between breaths\nis what she must always return to.\nThese mountains, this blue\nclarity of thought and air,\ngolden poppies and owl's clover\nblooming in the clefts left\nby earthquake, landslide, the flash-\nfire-rape of clinical depression\nthat abducts us but cannot\nkeep us down, air breathed\nfrom my mouth to hers, life\nanimating the pale white form\nof a woman I walk back into daylight\nwith from the world below, making\nof us both something greater\nthan loss, inscribing our names\nbeside those of Homer, Walt Whitman,\nZeus, and God, because it is already\nthe twenty-first century, and this\nis America, where I say\nthings like this can happen."}
