{"subject": "Weep On, Weep On", "text": "Weep on, weep on, your hour is past, \nYour dreams of pride are o'er; \nThe fatal chain is round you cast, \nAnd you are men no more. \nIn vain the hero's heart hath bled; \nThe sage's tongue hath warn'd in vain; \nOh, Freedom! once thy flame hath fled, \nIt never lights again! \n\nWeep on -- perhaps in after days, \nThey'll learn to love your name, \nWhen many a deed may wake in praise \nThat long hath slept in blame. \nAnd when they tread the ruin'd isle, \nWhere rest, at length, the lord and slave, \nThey'll wondering ask, how hands so vile \nCould conquer hearts so brave? \n\n\"'Twas fate,\" they'll say, \"a wayward fate \nYour web of discord wove; \nAnd while your tyrants join'd in hate, \nYou never join'd in love. \nBut hearts fell off that ought to twine, \nAnd man profaned what God had given; \nTill some were heard to curse the shrine \nWhere others knelt in heaven!\""}
