{"subject": "Unanswered Prayers", "text": "Like some school master, kind in being stern, \nWho hears the children crying o\u2019er their slates\nAnd calling, \u201cHelp me master! \u201d yet helps not, \nSince in his silence and refusal lies\nTheir self-development, so God abides\nUnheeding many prayers.  He is not deaf\nTo any cry sent up from earnest hearts, \nHe hears and strengthens when He must deny.\nHe sees us weeping over life\u2019s hard sums\nBut should He give us the key and dry our tears\nWhat would it profit us when school were done\nAnd not one lesson mastered? \n\t\t\tWhat a world\nWhere this if all our prayers were answered.  Not\nIn famed Pandora\u2019s box were such vast ills\nAs lie in human hearts.  Should our desires\nVoiced one by one in prayer ascend to God\nAnd come back as events shaped to our wish\nWhat chaos would result! \n\t\t\tIn my fierce youth\nI sighed out a breath enough to move a fleet\nVoicing wild prayers to heaven for fancied boons\nWhich were denied; and that denial bends\nMy knee to prayers of gratitude each day\nOf my maturer years.  Yet from those prayers\nI rose always regirded for the strife\nAnd conscious of new strength.  Pray on, sad heart, \nThat which thou pleadest for may not be given\nBut in the lofty altitude where souls\nWho supplicate God\u2019s grace are lifted there\nThou shalt find help to bear thy daily lot\nWhich is not elsewhere found."}
