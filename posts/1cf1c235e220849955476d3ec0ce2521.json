{"subject": "To The Tiber", "text": "On its late (in 1871) Inundation of Rome\n\nWell done, old Flood, that, hiding a clear eye\nBeneath thy yellow veil, dost wend among\nThose epic hills and dales of seven-topp'd song,\nTo keep watch on the stone eternity\nWhereof the mortal tenants die and die;\nOne more is gone, the deadliest of the long\nLine, the foul vast of whose unmeasured wrong\nTwined to its summit in the triple Lie\nOf that thrice-curs\u00e8d Crown. And thou, brave flood,\nEnterest a thousand years of carrion\nTo swill away the deeps of dung and blood,\nAnd drown the garbaged tribes that stank thereon,\nThat so, at least, the new investiture\nBe on clean threshold and a hearth-stone pure."}
