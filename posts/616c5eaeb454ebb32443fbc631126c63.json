{"subject": "Vision Of Peace, Joy Without Stain", "text": "Vision of peace, Joy without stain,\nThat on my vext heart sweetly shinest,\nHast thou, too, known the touch of pain,\nCares and dark hours, when in vain\nFor thy lost quiet thou repinest?\n\nHave those eyes, in whose pure spheres\nA refuge seems for all annoy,\nBeen indeed the place of tears?\nAh! grieve with those whom grief endears:\nStill, still to me be only Joy!"}
