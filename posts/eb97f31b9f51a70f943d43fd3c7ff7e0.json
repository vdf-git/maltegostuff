{"subject": "Last August Hours Before The Year 2000", "text": "Spun silk of mercy,\nlong-limbed afternoon,\nsun urging purple blossoms from baked stems.   \nWhat better blessing than to move without hurry   \nunder trees?\nLugging a bucket to the rose that became a twining   \nhouse by now, roof and walls of vine\u2014\nyou could live inside this rose.\nPouring a slow stream around the\nancient pineapple crowned with spiky fruit,   \nI thought we would feel old\nby the year 2000.\nWalt Disney thought cars would fly.\n\nWhat a drama to keep thinking the last summer   \nthe last birthday\nbefore the calendar turns to zeroes.\nMy neighbor says anything we plant\nin September takes hold.\nShe\u2019s lining pots of little grasses by her walk.\n\nI want to know the root goes deep   \non all that came before,\nyou could lay a soaker hose across   \nyour whole life and know\nthere was something\nunder layers of packed summer earth   \nand dry blown grass\nto moisten."}
