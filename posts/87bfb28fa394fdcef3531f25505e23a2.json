{"subject": "A Boy Juggling A Soccer Ball", "text": "after practice: right foot\nto left foot, stepping forward and back, \n to right foot and left foot,\nand left foot up to his thigh, holding \n it on his thigh as he twists\naround in a circle, until it rolls \n down the inside of his leg,\nlike a tickle of sweat, not catching \n and tapping on the soft\nside of his foot, and juggling\n once, twice, three times,\nhopping on one foot like a jump-roper \n in the gym, now trapping\nand holding the ball in midair, \n balancing it on the instep\nof his weak left foot, stepping forward \n and forward and back, then\nlifting it overhead until it hangs there; \n and squaring off his body,\nhe keeps the ball aloft with a nudge \n of his neck, heading it\nfrom side to side, softer and softer, \n like a dying refrain,\nuntil the ball, slowing, balances \n itself on his hairline,\nthe hot sun and sweat filling his eyes \n as he jiggles this way\nand that, then flicking it up gently, \n hunching his shoulders\nand tilting his head back, he traps it \n in the hollow of his neck,\nand bending at the waist, sees his shadow, \n his dangling T-shirt, the bent\nblades of brown grass in summer heat; \n and relaxing, the ball slipping\ndown his back...and missing his foot.\n\n He wheels around, he marches \nover the ball, as if it were a rock\n he stumbled into, and pressing\nhis left foot against it, he pushes it\n against the inside of his right \nuntil it pops into the air, is heeled\n over his head- the rainbow! -  \nand settles on his extended thigh before\n rolling over his knee and down \nhis shin, so he can juggle it again\n from his left foot to his right foot\n- and right foot to left foot to thigh- \n as he wanders, on the last day\nof summer, around the empty field."}
