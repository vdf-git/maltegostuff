{"subject": "Love", "text": "O power of Love, O wondrous mystery! \nHow is my dark illumined by thy light, \nThat maketh morning of my gloomy night, \nSetting my soul from Sorrow\u2019s bondage free \nWith swift-sent revelation! yea, I see \nBeyond the limitation of my sight \nAnd senses, comprehending now, aright, \nTo-day\u2019s proportion to Eternity. \nThrough thee, my faith in God is made more sure, \nMy searching eyes have pierced the misty veil; \nThe pain and anguish which stern Sorrow brings \nThrough thee become more easy to endure. \nLove-strong I mount; and Heaven\u2019s high summit scale; \nThrough thee, my soul has spread her folded wings."}
