{"subject": "Homosexuality", "text": "First I saw the round bill, like a bud;\nthen the sooty crested head, with avernal eyes\nflickering, distressed, then the peculiar\nlong neck wrapping and unwrapping itself,\nlike pity or love, when I removed the stovepipe\ncover of the bedroom chimney to free\nwhat was there and a duck crashed into the room\n(I am here in this fallen state), hitting her face,\nbending her throat back (my love, my inborn\nturbid wanting, at large all night), backing away,\ngnawing at her own wing linings (the poison of my life,\nthe beast, the wolf), leaping out the window,\nwhich I held open (now clear, sane, serene),\nbefore climbing back naked into bed with you."}
