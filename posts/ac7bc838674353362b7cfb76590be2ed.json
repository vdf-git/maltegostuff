{"subject": "Compensation", "text": "O RICH young lord, thou ridest by\nWith looks of high disdain;\nIt chafes me not thy title high,\nThy blood of oldest strain.\nThe lady riding at thy side\nIs but in name thy promised bride,\nRide on, young lord, ride on! \n\nHer father wills and she obeys,\nThe custom of her class;\n'Tis Land not Love the trothing sways-\nFor Land he sells his lass.\nHer fair white hand, young lord, is thine,\nHer soul, proud fool, her soul is mine,\nRide on, young lord, ride on! \n\nNo title high my father bore;\nThe tenant of thy farm,\nHe left me what I value more:\nClean heart, clear brain, strong arm\nAnd love for bird and beast and bee\nAnd song of lark and hymn of sea,\nRide on, young lord, ride on! \n\nThe boundless sky to me belongs,\nThe paltry acres thine;\nThe painted beauty sings thy songs,\nThe lavrock lilts me mine;\nThe hot-housed orchid blooms for thee,\nThe gorse and heather bloom for me,\nRide on, young lord, ride on!"}
