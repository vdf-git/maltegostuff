{"subject": "The Servant Of The Lord", "text": "Servant of God! thy soul's pure spring of life\nDisturb, defile not, with unholy strife;\nGentle to all, as it becomes thee well;\nFor what wert thou, ere dews of mercy fell\nUpon thy lifeless soul? From gracious heaven\nTo thee were life, and power, and pardon given;\n'Freely thou hast received,' oh 'freely give.'\nBe ever apt to teach; why should'st thou live\nAlone aloof, when vice and ignorance stalk\nAbroad with blushless cheek, crossing thy walk\nWith frequent horrors? Teach, and pray, and strive,\nAnd work with heaven in saving souls alive;\nPatient with men, and patient 'neath the rod,\nFor He who chastens is thy Father, God. \nMeekly instruct; God will thy work approve,\nAnd haters of the truth shall learn to love\nAnd own her sway, while bright through contrite tears,\nHope, smiling, points to heaven's eternal years.\nHow high the honour! how supreme the joy!\nHow great the gain! How blessed to destroy\nThe snares of Satan, teach the slaves of sin\nTo break their chains, and life and freedom win;\nThy slaves no more, dread author of all ill!\nNo more thy captives, taken at thy will."}
