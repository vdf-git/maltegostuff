{"subject": "God's Mourning Dove", "text": "Early in the morning a dove nestles in a lovely tall tree.\n I watch with delight wondering if this beautiful dove senses me.\n The feathers seem to be untouched as the dove remains silent.\n I feel the peace and solitude from the dove.\n Is GOD'S dove here for me to enjoy and feel peace in my heart?\n The answer lies in the face of GOD'S mourning dove."}
