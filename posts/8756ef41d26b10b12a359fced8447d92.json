{"subject": "For The Dedication Of The New City Library, Boston", "text": "PROUDLY, beneath her glittering dome,\nOur three-hilled city greets the morn;\nHere Freedom found her virgin home,--\nThe Bethlehem where her babe was born.\n\nThe lordly roofs of traffic rise\nAmid the smoke of household fires;\nHigh o'er them in the peaceful skies\nFaith points to heaven her clustering spires.\n\nCan Freedom breathe if ignorance reign?\nShall Commerce thrive where anarchs rule?\nWill Faith her half-fledged brood retain\nIf darkening counsels cloud the school?\n\nLet in the light! from every age\nSome gleams of garnered wisdom pour,\nAnd, fixed on thought's electric page,\nWait all their radiance to restore.\n\nLet in the light! in diamond mines\nTheir gems invite the hand that delves;\nSo learning's treasured jewels shine\nRanged on the alcove's ordered shelves.\n\nFrom history's scroll the splendor streams,\nFrom science leaps the living ray;\nFlashed from the poet's glowing dreams\nThe opal fires of fancy play.\n\nLet in the light! these windowed walls\nShall brook no shadowing colonnades,\nBut day shall flood the silent halls\nTill o'er yon hills the sunset fades.\n\nBehind the ever open gate\nNo pikes shall fence a crumbling throne,\nNo lackeys cringe, no courtiers wait,\nThis palace is the people's own!\n\nHeirs of our narrow-girdled past,\nHow fair the prospect we survey,\nWhere howled unheard the wintry blast,\nAnd rolled unchecked the storm-swept bay!\n\nThese chosen precincts, set apart\nFor learned toil and holy shrines,\nYield willing homes to every art\nThat trains, or strengthens, or refines.\n\nHere shall the sceptred mistress reign\nWho heeds her meanest subject's call,\nSovereign of all their vast domain,\nThe queen, the handmaid of them all!"}
