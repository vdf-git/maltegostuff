This always happened when\nI came close to a truth. Months passed. Years. Nights. \n\nShall I accommodate myself again,\na humble aquarium of lordly\nthumbs, some fin de species? Of course each word \n\nthe blackout-moth mutters to my keyboard\nshows the snowiest letter on this page is \u201cI\u201d\u2014\nmust I now plumb its one remaining pane?"}
