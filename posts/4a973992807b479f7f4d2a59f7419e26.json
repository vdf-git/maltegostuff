{"subject": "Ornithology", "text": "Walking toward the library, I pass three children\nstaring down at a dead crow and daring each other\nto poke it with a stick.\nI stop, too, because I know a little about crows -\nhow, for instance, they are different from ravens.\nI could tell these well-dressed children that:\nravens are black a with purple tint while crows\nare denied that royal hue. A crow's tale is squared-off\nlike the crew-cut on the boy at Menchie's who hands\nthem the expensive frozen yogurt\nwhile a raven's tale is triangular, a shape discovered\nby the Persians and beloved by the 17th century\nmathematician Blaise Pascal. Furthermore, ravens\nlove solitude and prefer remote hills and woods\nwhile a crow will perch on a stop sign and brag\nabout it endlessly.\nBut that isn't what they are concerned about.\nThey want to know about Death. And for that\nI would have to fetch the skull from my desktop\nand ask the sun to hide its face behind a dark,\ngalleon-shaped cloud and then -\nOh, wait. They're offering me the stick. All\nthey really want to know is will I poke the corpse.\nOf course. And when I do and it moves, they\nrun away shrieking and delighted. More alive,\nif possible, than before."}
