{"subject": "Psalm 6", "text": "Complaint in sickness.\n\nIn anger, Lord, rebuke me not;\nWithdraw the dreadful storm;\nNor let thy fury grow so hot\nAgainst a feeble worm.\n\nMy soul's bowed down with heavy cares,\nMy flesh with pain oppressed;\nMy couch is witness to my tears,\nMy tears forbid my rest.\n\nSorrow and pain wear out my days,\nI waste the night with cries,\nCounting the minutes as they pass,\nTill the slow morning rise.\n\nShall I be still tormented more?\nMine eye consumed with grief?\nHow long, my God, how long before\nThine hand afford relief?\n\nHe hears when dust and ashes speak,\nHe pities all our groans;\nHe saves us for his mercy's sake,\nAnd heals our broken bones.\n\nThe virtue of his sovereign word\nRestores our fainting breath;\nFor silent graves praise not the Lord,\nNor is he known in death."}
