{"subject": "When In Shaam The Caravan Of Widows Arrived", "text": "When in Shaam the caravan of widows arrived \nIn embarrassment they bowed their heads and cried \nSeeing spectators lined up on the streets \nTears of humiliation filled their eyes \nHaving trailed through the roads, shops and streets \nThe ladies reached the court of the evil Yazid \n\nThere Yazid conversed with Abid at length \nHearing Abid\u2019s responses, the courtiers wept  \nDisgraced, Yazid brought the discussion to a close \nEnraged at Sajjad\u2019s character and strength \nWhile everyone dispersed and returned to their homes \nTo prison the kin of the Prophet went on \nIn the dark prison, they sat heads bowed \nFrightened of the darkness, Sakina looked around \nSo exhausted was Abid from His journeys on foot \nHe dropped to the floor without a sound \nMany nights He had stayed up, many miles He had walked \nHe slept now, resting His ahead against the wall \n\u201cWhy is it so dark?\u201d Sakina wanted to know \n\u201cWhat place is this mother, where no air flows? \nThe darkness is smothering, I can\u2019t see a thing \nNot the earth beneath or the sky above\u201d \n\u201cWe cannot stay here, no one will survive \nWill lamps be lit when evening arrives?\u201d \u201cIf it stays this dark, I will certainly not last \nI\u2019m convinced that this night will not pass \nMy father would cradle me on his chest at night \nNow sleep on the dirt? I cannot alas\u201d \n\u201cIf a lamp blew out, I\u2019d wake with a start \nHave I ever, Oh Mother, slept in the dark?\u201d \nBanu replied, wiping Sakina\u2019s tears \n\u201cHush my little one, lest the guards hear \nThe sun will rise soon, the darkness will be gone \nOr moonlight will illumine this place my dear\u201d \n\u201cYou will soon feel a breeze, the night will cool down \nI\u2019ll hold you in my arms, rest Oh little one\u201d \nThus the mother consoled, cajoled and calmed \nThe girl was restless, the night stretched on \nSakina, restless and weary, sobbed through the night \nCurled up and wrapped in her mother\u2019s arms \nHer body frail and weak, she finally slept \nAnd Bano held Sakina in her arms and wept \nWithin moments Sakina was restless again \nShe felt her father\u2019s presence, of him she dreamt \nStretching wide her arms, she awoke with a start \nAnd peered in the darkness, her eyes seeking him \nShe cried \u201cOh Mother, not a thing I can see \nMy Father was here, tell me where is he?\u201d \nEveryone wept at Sakina\u2019s state \nAs did the prison guard, concealing his face \nNews of Sakina\u2019s distress was brought to Yazid  \nThat she weeps for her father, for him she prays \nInconsolable, distraught, nothing calms her down \nShe wants her father, she wants him now \u201cTake his head, show it to her\u201d Yazid ordered his men \nAnd Husain\u2019s severed head was carried thence \nIts glory and radiance lighting the path \nFragrant and glorious Its noble presence \nSensing the haloed arrival, the prisoners hastily rose \nImpatiently Sakina waited by the door  \nAnxious to see Him, smiling through her tears \nThe air grew fragrant as His head drew near  \nWith His aura the prison air transformed \nGone with the gloom was Sakina\u2019s fear \nIn reception the prisoners lined up at the door \nIn respect and salutation Abid arose \nAnxious to hold Him, Sakina spread her tattered dress \nAnd hugged His head close to her chest \nShe kissed His forehead, His cheeks, His lips \nThe prisoners sat around her in awe and respect \nZainab sat forlorn, hair strewn, head bare \nHusain\u2019s glance was affixed to his sister\u2019s face \nHolding her dear father\u2019s severed head \nSakina sat on the floor, whispered and pled \nSpoke words of love, of her loss, her pain \nThen all went quiet as though she were dead \nHer face resting on her father\u2019s face \nShe sighed and shuddered then took her last breath \nAt first, her silence gave no one alarm \nFor everyone thought she was feeling calm \nBut as the silence stretched, the mother cried out \n\u201cWake up dear Sakina, pass the head to you aunt\u201d  \nHearing no response, terror filled Banu\u2019s heart \n\u201cShe\u2019s fainted\u201d said everyone, \u201cBanu take heart\u201d Banu lifted Sakina into her arms \nSaw the lifeless limbs, eyes shut, face calm \nNeck limp, face drooping to her chest, not a sound \n\u201cWhat is this?\u201d She cried, \u201cWhat is this now?\u201d \n\u201cWhat healer do I consult, where do I go? \nI am locked in prison door, what do I do?\u201d \nShe fanned Sakina\u2019s chest, lifting her shirt \n\u201cPray my lady,\u201d she turned to Zainab and urged \nShe called out to Abid in utter distress \n\u201cHelp me my son, your sister won\u2019t stir\u201d \n\u201cI am trying to wake her but I see no response \nShe may have passed out, yet her breathing has stopped\u201d \nFeeling his sister\u2019s pulse Abid sighed and tensed \nAnd the mother cried \u201cI have no more strength\u201d \n\u201cYet I\u2019ll face the truth, do not hide from me son\u201d \nAbid replied \u201cDear mother, Sakina is dead\u201d \n\u201cLay her down on the sand, let her body rest \nHer body is bruised, yet she\u2019s peaceful in death\u201d \n\u201cIn this dark prison my daughter is dead?\u201d \nBanu cried \u201cThis death I can never forget\u201d \nAnd Fizza ran to the door and asked the guards \nFor a lamp to light the house of the dead \n\u201cNo one keeps a body laying so in the dark \nYet our little girl lies in the prison pitch black\u201d \nWith the coming of dawn, the prison was lit \nAnd Banu bent over Sakina and looked \nSaw the bruised ears, dried blood on her neck  \nHer dress blood-stained, torn and burnt \nFace pale, Sakina rested on the dirt floor \nHair laden with dust, crying no more \u201cMy dearest\u201d She cried, \u201cCome wake up now \nIts time for prayers, your head you must bow\u201d \n\u201cYou\u2019ve never needed to be awoken for prayers before \nYou awoke on your own, what has happened now? \nYou know the guards\u2019 fury, do not so doze \nThis is not home Sakina, they\u2019ll come to the door\u201d \n\u201cThe darkness troubled you, you couldn\u2019t rest \nYou\u2019d pray for a breeze, you\u2019d get upset \nThe breeze from heaven will cool you tonight \nIn your new home Sakina my dear sleep well\u201d \n\u201cI hope you find comforts you couldn\u2019t find here \nMay your grave be roomier than this prison my dear\u201d"}
