{"subject": "At Sea", "text": "Now the tide is safe and high,\nIn the fresh'ning morning breeze,\nOver the harbour bar we hie\nOut into the open seas.\nWith these fisher lads so strong\nAnd knowing in the water ways,\nI'll try to make a summer song,\nThe fisher's summer life to praise.\nIt seems to me the rounded sea\nBegins to swell above the shore,\nAnd the great gull, that fisher free,\nDives right down a yard or more.\n\nWith main and jib we bound along,\nThrough showers of spray we rise and dip,\nBut as for making any song,\nThat needs a sea apprenticeship.\nAnd now we meet the ocean swell,\nThe bow swings high up in the air;\nMy breath goes with it! I know well\nThe land is best for me, not there!\nWe islanders should love the sea,\nThe fresh wind, coiled nets, ballast heap,\nAnd full brown sail; but as for me,\nAgain within that harbour's lee,\nI let the sea-song go to sleep!"}
