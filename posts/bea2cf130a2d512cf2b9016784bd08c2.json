{"subject": "Canada", "text": "It was formerly believed, on a sea-battered shore\nthough the storm at home blasted,\nthat in the distant west there still lay lands,\nwhere calm and sun never ended,\nfor there the good season had found it's retreat\nand freedom and compassion - all that is best.\n\nThey set no sail, but thought high,\nby the ocean they dreaming stood,\nas the sun slid into the lowest west\nin the evening's blue-misted spring dusk,\nthen hope and desire glide out with the breeze\non the still-blank, sun gilt, wide armed sea.\n\nThough oceans still flood, that separate lands,\nthe passage across is effortless.\nAnd our Markland, Canada, its genius and care\nthe world held out to you over the sea.\nTo the Greeks you could only appear in a poem -\nbut to Icelandic sea kings you gave yourself first.\n\nStill human hope turns its tired eyes\nfrom the east, to dream about you -\nyou proved good to all, who loved you fervently,\nwho possess here rapture and home.\nAnd all with you is fullfilled and able to root\nwhich the unquiet spirit has dreamed best."}
