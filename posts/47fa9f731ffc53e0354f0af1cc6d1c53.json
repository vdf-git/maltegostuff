{"subject": "An Elegy On The Death Of Montgomery Tappen", "text": " An elegy on the death of MONTGOMERY TAPPEN who dies at Poughkeepsie on the 20th of Nov. 1784 in the ninth year of his age.\nThe sweetest, gentlest, of the youthful train,\nHere lies his clay cold upon the sable bier!\nHe scarce had started on life's varied plain,\nFor dreary death arrested his career. \n\nHis cheek might vie with the expanded rose,\nAnd Genius sparkled in his azure eyes!\nA victim so unblemish'd Heaven chose,\nAnd bore the beauteous lambkin to the skies. \n\nAdieu thou loveliest child! Adieu adieu!\nOur wishes fain would follow thee on high.\nWhat more can friendship - what more fondness do,\nBut drop the unbidden tear &amp; heave the sigh? \n\nYe youths whose ardent bosoms virtue fires,\nWho eager wish applause and pant for fame,\nPress round MONTGOMERY'S hearse, the NAME inspires\nAnd lights in kindred souls its native flame. \n\nCOLUMBIA grateful hails the tender sound\nAnd when MONTGOMERY'S nam'd still drops a tear,\nFrom shore to shore to earth's remotest bound\nWhere LIBERTY is known that NAME is dear."}
