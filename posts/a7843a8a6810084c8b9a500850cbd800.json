{"subject": "David's Lament For Jonathan", "text": "Thou wast hard pressed, yet God concealed this thing\nFrom me; and thou wast wounded very sore,\nAnd beaten down, O son of Israel's king,\nLike wheat on threshing-flour.\n\nThou, that from courtly and from wise for friend\nDidst choose me, and in spite of ban and sneer,\nRebuke and ridicule, until the end\nDidst ever hold me dear!\n\nAll night thy body on the mountain lay:\nAt morn the heathen nailed thee to their wall.\nSurely their deaf gods hear the songs to-day\nO'er the slain House of Saul!\n\nOh! if that witch were here thy father sought,\nMethinks I e'en could call thee from thy place,\nTo shift thy mangled image from my thought,\nSeeing thy soul's calm face.\n\nI sorrowed for the words the prophet spoke,\nThat set me rival to thy father's line;\nBut o'er thy spirit no repining broke\nFor what had else been thine.\n\nThou wast not like to me, so rude, so hot;\nThe world was not in thine, as in my sight,\nLike the proud giant who from Israel sought\nA champion to fight.\n\nI thought to ask, nor looked to be denied,\nOf God, that in my days there might ascend\nHis House; not from my hands, so redly dyed,\nBut thine, pure-hearted friend.\n\nMy friend, within God's House thou dwellest now;\nThy wounds are healed, thou need'st no Gilead-balm;\nDefeated and degraded, yet thy brow\nIs crowned, with death and calm.\n\nO God, this is Thy black and bitter sea\nWhich buffets so and blinds my struggling soul:\nOut of the depths I cry, O God, to Thee,\nWhose grief-waves o'er me roll.\n\nGod give to me the spirit that was his,\nThe patience, that he needs no more to blend\nWith the wild eagerness that mars my bliss;\nI would be like my friend.\n\nThrough the dark valley soon, to where he stands,\nGod summon me! Till then the sword shall shine\nThat comes from his dead grasp into my hands:\nHis children be as mine!"}
