{"subject": "The Rock", "text": "Here the inscrutable purpose of my God\nSet me, to be to men a thing of hate,\nWatching the way where the weary steamers plod,\nDoomed to the end to slay and desolate.\n\nPassive I stand and slay thro' the shouting night,\nWhen doomed ships drive against my stirless frame,\nAnd windy seas, lashed mad to a shimmer of white,\nCurtain my brows as if to hide my shame.\n\nYet, when the sea rolls calm to the skyline's edge,\nFading, a magic realm, in sunset's glow,\nAnd the seabirds bask and nestle on hollow and ledge,\nAlmost I dream It will be always so.\n\nAlmost I dream that the seas will never awake,\nTossing their manes of foam against the sky,\nWhere now, 'neath the trail of smoke that the liners make,\nMen look on me, and know the land is nigh.\n\nTho' mine be a name of sorrow, a word of fear,\nEven on my brows the wandering seabirds rest;\nAnd, when men see me heralding home so near,\nEven the race I slay salute me blest."}
