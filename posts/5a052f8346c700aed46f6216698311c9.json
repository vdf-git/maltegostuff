{"subject": "The Aloe Plant", "text": "HAVE YOU HEARD the tale of the aloe plant, \nAway in the sunny clime? \nBy humble growth of a hundred years \nIt reaches its blooming time; \nAnd then a wondrous bud at its crown \nBreaks into a thousand flowers; \nThis floral queen in its blooming seen \nIs the pride of the tropical bowers; \nBut the plant to the flower is a sacrifice, \nFor it blooms but once, and in blooming dies. \n\nHave you heard the tale of the pelican, \nThe Arab's Gomel el Bahr, \nThat dwells in the African solitudes \nWhere the birds that live lonely are? \nHave you heard how it loves its tender young, \nAnd cares and toils for their good? \nIt brings them water from fountains afar \nAnd fishes the seas for their food. \nIn famine it feeds them what love can devise \u2014 \nThe blood of its bosom \u2014 and, feeding them, dies. \n\nHave you heard the tale they tell of the swan, \nThe snow-white bird of the lake? \nIt noiselessly floats on the silvery wave, \nIt silently sits in the brake; \nFor it saves its song till the end of life, \nAnd then, in the soft, still even, \n'Mid the golden light of the setting sun \nIt sings as it soars into heaven, \nAnd the blessed notes fall back from the skies \u2014 \n'Tis its only song, for in singing it dies. \n\nYou have heard the tales. Shall I tell you one, \nA greater and better than all? \nHave you heard of Him whom the Heavens adore, \nBefore whom the hosts of them fall? \nHow He left the choirs and anthems above \nFor earth in its wailings and woes, \nAnd suffered the shame and pain of the cross \nTo die for the life of His foes. \nHis death is our life, His loss is our gain \u2014 \nThe joy for the tear \u2014 the peace for the pain."}
