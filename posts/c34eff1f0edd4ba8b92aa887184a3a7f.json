{"subject": "Sonnet Lxxxviii:  Hero's Lamp.", "text": "That lamp thou fill'st in Eros' name to-night,\nO Hero, shall the Sestian augurs take\nTo-morrow, and for drowned Leander's sake\nTo Anteros its fireless lip shall plight.\nAye, waft the unspoken vow: yet dawn's first light\nOn ebbing storm and life twice ebb'd must break;\nWhile 'neath no sunrise, by the Avernian Lake,\nLo where Love walks, Death's pallid neophyte.\nThat lamp within Anteros' shadowy shrine\nShall stand unlit (for so the gods decree)\nTill some one man the happy issue see\nOf a life's love, and bid its flame to shine:\nWhich still may rest unfir'd; for, theirs or thine,\nO brother, what brought love to them or thee?"}
