{"subject": "It's Always Strange to Sleep in Cities", "text": "It's always strange to sleep in cities\nyou haven't seen in daylight.\nYou could be anywhere, anyone\ncould breathe next door while\nunder used blankets you dream\nof waking to the world's highest spires,\nfastest clouds, brightest snow.\n\nYou dream of drunken rooftops\nstrewn with shards of broken stars\nand you dream of the people you loved\na long time ago, when you still could.\nAnd suddenly, they're down in the streets,\nin this city of shadows and light.\nIt seems they've always been here.\n\nAnd you tell them without words\nbecause words are not\nin the nature of this dream\nhow much has happened since.\nHow strange you find it to be here,\nneither in the future, nor the past.\n\nThey thank you for your visit,\neverything is fine, they say,\ntheir mouths opening without a voice,\ntheir manner growing distant and suspicious,\neverything is fine. Then dawn\nbreaks over the city, and they are gone."}
