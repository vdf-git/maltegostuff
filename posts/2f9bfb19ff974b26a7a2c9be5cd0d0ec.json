{"subject": "Bengali Market", "text": "Dear Mr. Gandhi\nIt was cold the day the masjid\nwas torn down stone by stone,\ncolder still at the heart of Delhi\n\nTen years later entering Bengali market\nI saw a street filled with bicycles\ngirls with rushing hair,  boys in bright caps\nI heard a voice cry\n\nCan you describe this?\nIt sounded like a voice \nfrom a city crusted with snow\nto the far north of the Asian continent.\n\nI saw him then, your grandson \nin a rusty three wheeler \nwrapped up in what wools he could muster.\nBehind  him in red letters \n\na sign: Dr. Gandhi's Clinic.\nSo he said, embracing me, you've come back. \nThen pointing to the clinic - \nIts not that I'm sick\n\nthat gentleman gets my mail and I his. \nThat is why I am perched in this contraption. \nI cannot stay long, it is Id ul Fitr. \nI must greet friends in Old Delhi, wish them well.\n\nLater he sought  me out in dreams.\nin a high kitchen in sharp sunlight\ndressed in a khadi kurta, baggy jeans.\nHe touched my throat in greeting.\n\nListen my sweet, for half of each year, \nafter the carriage was set on fire \nafter the Gujarat  killings,\nI disappear into darkness..\n\nIn our country there are two million dead \nand more for whom no rites were said.\nNo land on earth can bear this.\nRivers are criss-crossed with blood.\n\nAll day I hear the scissor bird cry \ncut cut cut cut cut\nIt is the bird Kalidasa heard\nas he stood singing of  buried love.\n\nNow our boys and girls take \nflight on rusty bicycles.\nWill we be cured? I cried\nAnd he: We have no tryst with destiny.\n\nMy hands like yours are stained \nwith the juice of the pomegrante.\nPlease don't ask for my address. \nI am in and out of Bengali market."}
