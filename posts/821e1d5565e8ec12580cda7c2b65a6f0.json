{"subject": "Theoretikos", "text": "THIS mighty empire hath but feet of clay:\n            Of all its ancient chivalry and might\n            Our little island is forsaken quite:\n          Some enemy hath stolen its crown of bay,\n          And from its hills that voice hath passed away\n            Which spake of Freedom: O come out of it,\n            Come out of it, my Soul, thou art not fit\n          For this vile traffic-house, where day by day\n            Wisdom and reverence are sold at mart,\n            And the rude people rage with ignorant cries\n          Against an heritage of centuries.\n            It mars my calm: wherefore in dreams of Art\n            And loftiest culture I would stand apart,\n          Neither for God, nor for his enemies."}
