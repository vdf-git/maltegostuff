{"subject": "Sweeping Meadows Arranged In Cryptic Message Forms", "text": "Out of nowhere comes the call above ominous cloud storm\n Fleeting waves sail across swells of sunset's amber glow\n Mauve tinged skies stretched beyond space seen catched in tow\n Faced with ever the dilemma to turn to just one for trust\n How can a heart choose to lose the one returned to dust\n There is the dream now can come true\n Only in one eternity of two\n Forlorn secret memory gone in time to wait\n Fails disappointment the instant turned to hate\n Stories transformed recall a sweet reunion\n To remember love's sonnets extreme unction\n Bring back soul beloved of the original\n To merge its handiwork behalf life's jumble\n Songs eons ago with inner themes in mind\n Give happy a heart full blessed favor in kind\n Once again embrace joy found\n Through rapture free unbound\n Fashion not a mystic illusion pristine\n Grasp life's real passion, \"love\" for Christine"}
