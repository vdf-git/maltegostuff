{"subject": "Triangle Of Love", "text": "Three people, all different.\n Yet each one the same.\n Confusion is known\n Rejoicing in pain.\n Two are in love,\n At least so they think.\n A girl and a boy,\n Words said in hate.\n The third is a boy,\n New to the game he plays.\n She cares for them both,\n In two separate ways.\n Which will she choose,\n When she loves them both so.\n She'd tell you now,\n But she still doesn't know."}
