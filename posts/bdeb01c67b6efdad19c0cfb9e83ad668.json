{"subject": "Growing Old", "text": "Little by little the year grows old,\nThe red leaves drop from the maple boughs;\nThe sun grows dim, and the winds blow cold,\nDown from the distant arctic seas.\n\nOut of the skies the soft light dies,\nAnd the shadows of autumn come creeping over,\nAnd the bee and the bird are no longer heard\nIn grove or meadow, or field of clover.\n\nLittle by little our lives grow old,\nOur faces no longer are fair to see;\nFor gray creeps into the curls of gold,\nAnd the red fades out of the cheeks, ah me!\n\nAnd the birds that sang till our heart strings rang\nWith strains of hope, and joy, and pleasure,\nHave flown away; and our hearts today\nHear only the weird wind's solemn measure.\n\nYouth and summer, and beauty and bloom,\nDroop and die in the autumn weather,\nBut up from the gloom of the winter's tomb,\nThey shall rise, in God's good time, together."}
