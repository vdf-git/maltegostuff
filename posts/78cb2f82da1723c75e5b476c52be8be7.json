{"subject": "The Fugitive", "text": "The air is perfumed with the morning's fresh breeze,\n From the bush peer the sunbeams all purple and bright,\nWhile they gleam through the clefts of the dark-waving trees,\n And the cloud-crested mountains are golden with light.\n\nWith joyful, melodious, ravishing, strain,\n The lark, as he wakens, salutes the glad sun,\nWho glows in the arms of Aurora again,\n And blissfully smiling, his race 'gins to run.\n\nAll hail, light of day!\nThy sweet gushing ray\nPours down its soft warmth over pasture and field;\nWith hues silver-tinged\nThe meadows are fringed,\nAnd numberless suns in the dewdrop revealed.\n\nYoung Nature invades\nThe whispering shades,\n   Displaying each ravishing charm;\nThe soft zephyr blows,\nAnd kisses the rose,\n   The plain is sweet-scented with balm.\n\nHow high from yon city the smoke-clouds ascend!\nTheir neighing, and snorting, and bellowing blend\nThe horses and cattle;\nThe chariot-wheels rattle,\nAs down to the valley they take their mad way;\n   And even the forest where life seems to move,\n   The eagle, and falcon, and hawk soar above,\nAnd flutter their pinions, in heaven's bright ray.\n\nIn search of repose\nFrom my heart-rending woes,\n   Oh, where shall my sad spirit flee?\nThe earth's smiling face,\nWith its sweet youthful grace,\n   A tomb must, alas, be for me!\n\nArise, then, thou sunlight of morning, and fling\n O'er plain and o'er forest thy purple-dyed beams!\nThou twilight of evening, all noiselessly sing\n In melody soft to the world as it dreams!\n\nAh, sunlight of morning, to me thou but flingest\n Thy purple-dyed beams o'er the grave of the past!\nAh, twilight of evening, thy strains thou but singest\n To one whose deep slumbers forever must last!"}
