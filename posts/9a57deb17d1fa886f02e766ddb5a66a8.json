{"subject": "Song Xli.  Dearly I Love Johnny, O", "text": "When Sandy first a wooing came,\nHe fondly try'd to win my heart,\nAnd blush'd whene'er he own'd his flame;\nBut soon I guess'd his wily art.\nTho' ilka lad in tartan plaid\nShould ca' me blythe and bonie, O,\nThey'd try in vain my heart to gain,\nSo dearly I love Johnny, O.\n\nTho' Johnny canna boast of wealth,\nContentment crowns his lowly state;\nHis ruddy cheeks denote sweet health,\nAnd goodness mak's the laddie great.\nIn Aberdeen sure ne'er was seen\nA youth sae blythe and bonie, O;\nHis flatt'ring tale can aye prevail,\nSo dearly I love Johnny, O.\n\nThe ither morn upo' the bent\nI met my lad sae brisk and gay;\nHe vow'd, unless I'd gi'e consent,\nHe'd o'er the hills and far away.\nAs hame we stray'd his pipes he play'd,\nAnd sang of love sae bonie, O,\nI made a vow to buckle to,\nSo dearly I love Johnny, O."}
