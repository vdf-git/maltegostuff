{"subject": "Farewell", "text": "Can I see thee stand\nOn the looming land?\nDost thou wave with thy white hand\nFarewell, farewell?\nI could think that thou art near,\nThy sweet voice is in mine ear,\nFarewell, farewell!\nWhile I listen, all things seem\nSinging in a singing dream,\nFarewell, farewell!\nEchoing in an echoing dream,\nFarewell, farewell!\nYon boat upon the sea,\nIt floats 'twixt thee and me,\nI see the boatman listless lie;\nHe cannot hear the cry\nThat in mine ears doth ring\nFarewell, farewell!\nDoth it pass him o'er and o'er,\nHeard upon the shore behind,\nFarewell, farewell!\nHeard upon the ship before,\nFarewell, farewell!\nLike an arrow that can dart\nViewless thro' the viewless wind,\nPlain on the quivering string,\nAnd plain in the victim's heart?\nAre there voices in the sky,\nFarewell, farewell?\nAm I mocked by the bright air,\nFarewell, farewell?\nThe empty air that everywhere\nSilvers back the sung reply,\nFarewell, farewell!\nWhile to and fro the tremulous accents fly,\nFarewell, farewell!\nNow shown, now shy,\nFarewell, farewell!\nNow song, now sigh,\nFarewell, farewell!\nToy with the grasping heart that deems them nigh,\nCome like blown bells in sudden wind and high,\nOr far on furthest verge in lingering echoes die,\nFarewell, farewell!\nFarewell, farewell, farewell!\nOh, Love! what strange dumb Fate\nHath broken into voice to see us hope?\nSurely we part to meet again?\nLike one struck blind, I grope\nIn vain, in vain;\nI cannot hold a single sense to tell\nThe meaning of this melancholy bell,\nFarewell, farewell!\nI touch them with my thought, and small and great\nThey join the swaying swell,\nFarewell, farewell!\nFarewell, farewell, farewell!\nAye, when I felt thee falling\nOn this heaving breast-\nAye, when I felt thee prest\nNearer, nearer, nearer,\nDearer, dearer, dearer-\nAye, while I saw thy face,\nIn that long last embrace,\nThe first, the last, the best-\nAye, while I held thee heart to heart,\nMy soul had pushed off from the shore,\nAnd we were far apart;\nI heard her calling, calling,\nFrom the sea of nevermore\nFarewell, farewell!\nFainter, fainter, like a bell\nRung from some receding ship,\nFarewell, farewell!\nThe far and further knell\nDid hardly reach my lip,\nFarewell, farewell!\nFarewell, farewell, farewell!\nAway, you omens vain!\nAway, away!\nWhat! will you not be driven?\nMy heart is trembling to your augury.\nHence! Like a flight of seabirds at a gun,\nA thousand ways they scatter back to Heaven,\nWheel lessening out of sight, and swoop again as one!\nFarewell, farewell!\nFarewell, farewell, farewell!\nOh, Love! what fatal spell\nIs winding, winding round me to this singing?\nWhat hands unseen are flinging\nThe tightening mesh that I can feel too well?\nWhat viewless wings are winging\nThe siren music of this passing bell?\nFarewell, farewell!\nFarewell, farewell, farewell!\nArouse my heart! arouse!\nThis is the sea: I strike these wooden walls:\nThe sailors come and go at my command:\nI lift this cable with my hand:\nI loose it and it falls:\nArouse! she is not lost,\nThou art not plighted to a moonlight ghost,\nBut to a living spouse.\nArouse! we only part to meet again!\nOh thou moody main,\nAre thy mermaid cells a-ringing?\nAre thy mermaid sisters singing?\nThe saddest shell of every cell\nRinging still, and ringing\nFarewell, farewell!\nTo the sinking sighing singing,\nTo the floating flying singing,\nTo the deepening dying singing,\nIn the swell,\nFarewell, farewell!\nAnd the failing wailing ringing,\nThe reaming dreaming ringing\nOf fainter shell in deeper cell,\nTo the sunken sunken singing,\nFarewell, farewell!\nFarewell, farewell!\nFarewell, farewell, farewell?"}
