{"subject": "The Last Chrysanthemum", "text": "Why should this flower delay so long \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To show its tremulous plumes? \nNow is the time of plaintive robin-song, \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When flowers are in their tombs. \n\nThrough the slow summer, when the sun \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Called to each frond and whorl \nThat all he could for flowers was being done, \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Why did it not uncurl? \n\nIt must have felt that fervid call \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although it took no heed, \nWaking but now, when leaves like corpses fall, \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And saps all retrocede. \n\nToo late its beauty, lonely thing, \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The season's shine is spent, \nNothing remains for it but shivering \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In tempests turbulent. \n\nHad it a reason for delay, \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Dreaming in witlessness \nThat for a bloom so delicately gay \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Winter would stay its stress? \n\n- I talk as if the thing were born \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With sense to work its mind; \nYet it is but one mask of many worn \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By the Great Face behind."}
