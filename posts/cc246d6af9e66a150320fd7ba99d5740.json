{"subject": "The Boss Over The Board", "text": "When he\u2019s over a rough and unpopular shed,\nWith the sins of the bank and the men on his head;\nWhen he musn\u2019t look black or indulge in a grin,\nAnd thirty or forty men hate him like Sin\u2014\nI am moved to admit\u2014when the total is scored\u2014\nThat it\u2019s just a bit off for the Boss-of -the-board.\nI have battled a lot,\nBut my dream\u2019s never soared\nTo the lonely position of Boss-of-the-board. \n\u2019Twas a black-listed shed down the Darling: the Boss\nWas a small man to see\u2014though a big man to cross\u2014\nWe had nought to complain of\u2014except what we thought,\nAnd the Boss didn\u2019t boss any more than he ought;\nBut the Union was booming, and Brotherhood soared,\nSo we hated like poison the Boss-of-the-board.\nWe could tolerate \u2018hands\u2019\u2014\nWe respected the cook;\nBut the name of a Boss was a blot in our book. \n\nHe\u2019d a row with Big Duggan\u2014a rough sort of Jim\u2014\nOr, rather, Jim Duggan was \u2018laying for\u2019 him!\nHis hate of Injustice and Greed was so deep\nThat his shearing grew rough\u2014and he ill-used the sheep.\nAnd I fancied that Duggan his manliness lower\u2019d\nWhen he took off his shirt to the Boss-of-the-board,\nFor the Boss was ten stone,\nAnd the shearer full-grown,\nAnd he might have, they said, let the crawler alone. \n\nThough some of us there wished the fight to the strong,\nYet we knew in our hearts that the shearer was wrong.\nAnd the crawler was plucky, it can\u2019t be denied,\nFor he had to fight Freedom and Justice beside,\nBut he came up so gamely, as often as floored,\nThat a blackleg stood up for the Boss-of-the-board!\nAnd the fight was a sight,\nAnd we pondered that night\u2014\n\u2018It\u2019s surprising how some of those blacklegs can fight!\u2019 \n\nNext day at the office, when sadly the wreck\nOf Jim Duggan came up like a lamb for his cheque,\nSaid the Boss, \u2018Don\u2019t be childish! It\u2019s all past and gone;\n\u2018I am short of good shearers. You\u2019d better stay on.\u2019\nAnd we fancied Jim Duggan our dignity lower\u2019d\nWhen he stopped to oblige a damned Boss-of-the-board.\nWe said nothing to Jim,\nFor a joke might be grim,\nAnd the subject, we saw, was distasteful to him. \n\nThe Boss just went on as he\u2019d done from the first,\nAnd he favoured Big Duggan no more than the worst;\nAnd when we\u2019d cut out and the steamer came down\u2014\nWith the hawkers and spielers\u2014to take us to town,\nAnd we\u2019d all got aboard, \u2019twas Jim Duggan, good Lord!\nWho yelled for three cheers for the Boss-of-the-board.\n\u2019Twas a bit off, no doubt\u2014\nAnd with Freedom about\u2014\nBut a lot is forgot when a shed is cut out. \n\nWith Freedom of Contract maintained in his shed,\nAnd the curse of the Children of Light on his head,\nHe\u2019s apt to long sadly for sweetheart or wife,\nAnd his views be inclined to the dark side of life.\nThe Truth must be spread and the Cause must be shored\u2014\nBut it\u2019s just a bit rough on the Boss-of-the-board.\nI am all for the Right,\nBut perhaps (out of sight)\nAs a son or a husband or father he\u2019s white."}
