{"subject": "Sonnet Xiv. The Telegraph And Telephone.", "text": "FLEETER than time, across the Continent,\nThrough unsunned ocean depths, from beach to beach,\nAround the rolling globe Thought's couriers reach.\nThe new-tuned earth like some vast instrument\nTingles from zone to zone; for Art has lent\nNew nerves, new pulse, new motion \u2014 all to each,\nAnd each to all, in swift electric speech\nBound by a force unwearied and unspent.\nNow lone Katahdin talks with Caucasus;\nThe Arctic ice-fields with the sultry South,\nThe sun-bathed palm thrills to the pine-tree's call.\nWe for all realms were made, and they for us.\nFor all there is a soul, an ear, a mouth;\nAnd Time and Space are naught. The mind is all."}
