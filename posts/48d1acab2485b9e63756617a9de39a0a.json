{"subject": "Symphonic Expanse", "text": "If you'd seen \nthe Gaillardots' mullein in the Cedars of the Shouf; \nif you'd seen the Aleppo dock, red with iron, \nin Bcharre where the Adonis River's said to run as red \n\nwith what was \nthought his blood; if you'd seen the bearded oat in Burjein, \nthe rayed white horehound in Tripoli; or maybe \nthe milkwort in Ehden, as often I saw the strigose bellflower \n\nand the cyclamen, \nyou might have been the more awed by a mallow-leaved \nbindweed in Aley on your way to the brunnera in Baalbek. \nThe Mediterranean poppy in Nabatieh, Beirut mullein \n\nin nearby Baabda, \nconnate Alexanders in Qadisha, fodder vetch in Zgharta,\nwhite rocket in Sour, Gypsywort in Marjeyoun, \nheaded Ziziphora in Baakleen, bladder skullcap in Barouk. \n\nThe viscid catchfly, \nah, vying with bats at evening in Zahle\u2014for these the earth \nof continuous habitation since the Chalcolithic Age \nsalivates at dawn. But not a reed grows where no grave is. \n\nIn Sacandaga Valley,\ntwo thousand bodies were trans-buried by the boneyard gang. \nThey ceded the pitted ground to the dentist gang, \nwhose jackhammers drilled the rock beneath.\n\nPowder monkeys tamped \nthe holes with dynamite. The beaver-tooth gang's axes \nand cross-cut saws cleared the trees. Bush burners followed. \nThe fires burned for two years. The patience of dam builders \n\nbuilt a force \nequal to the water: It flooded the ashes, the railroad station, \nand a train, which I saw transposed in the steely swells, \nor so it seemed. But iron turns a torrent red."}
