{"subject": "Michael's Wine", "text": "Winter again and we want\nthe same nocturnal rocking,\nwatching cedar spit\nand sketch its leafy flames,\nour rooms steamy with garlic\nand greasy harvest stew.\nOutside frosted windows--\nclaw marks on yellow pine,\n\nVenus wobbling in the sky,\nthe whole valley a glare of ice.\nWe gather in the kitchen\nto make jam from damsons\nand blue Italian prunes,\nlast fruit of the orchard,\nsweetest after frost, frothy bushels\nsteeping in flecked enamel pots.\n\nMichael, our neighbor,\ndecants black cherry wine,\nfruit he ground two years ago,\nbound with sugar, then racked\nand racked again. It's young and dry.\nWe toast ourselves, our safety,\ntime the brandied savory\nof late November.\n\nI killed a man this day last year,\nsays Michael, while you were away.\nComing home from town alone,\nyou know the place in Lolo where the road\ncurves, where the herd of horses got loose\nNew Year's Eve, skidded around\nwhite-eyed, cars sliding into them?\nDidn't see the man until my windshield broke.\n\nCould have been any one of us.\nTwenty-nine years old, half-drunk,\nhalf-frozen. Red and black hunting jacket.\nLucky I was sober. We stand there\nplum-stained as Michael's face\nfractures into tics and lines.\nHe strokes his wine red beard.\nMichael with no family,\n\ngentle farmer's hands, tilts the bottle,\npours a round, as if to toast.\nIt was so cold, he says,\nthat when it was over,\nhe swirls the distilled cherries\nunder a green lamp, there was less\nblood on the pavement than you see\nthis moment in my glass."}
