{"subject": "Madness", "text": "Through alleys of sunset, a woman does hover,\nShe weeps: Give me back the straw, my lover.\n\nBehind her a crowd, with water and rope,\nThat would not give back her straw and her hope.\n\nHer yellow shawl slips off of her shoulder,\nFrom afar \u2014 a firetruck comes, ringing bolder.\n\nAnd no one in the crowd, shouting and raw,\nWill grasp: can you fall in love with a straw?\n\n1940"}
