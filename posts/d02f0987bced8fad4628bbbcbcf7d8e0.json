{"subject": "Olney Hymn 64: Praise For Faith", "text": "Of all the gifts Thine hand bestows, \nThou Giver of all good! \nNot heaven itself a richer knows \nThan my Redeemer's blood. \n\nFaith too, the blood-receiving grace, \nFrom the same hand we gain; \nElse, sweetly as it suits our case, \nThat gift had been in vain. \n\nTill Thou Thy teaching power apply, \nOur hearts refuse to see, \nAnd weak, as a distemper'd eye, \nShut out the view of Thee. \n\nBlind to the merits of Thy Son, \nWhat misery we endure! \nYet fly that Hand from which alone \nWe could expect a cure. \n\nWe praise Thee, and would praise Thee more, \nTo Thee our all we owe: \nThe precious Saviour, and the power \nThat makes Him precious too."}
