{"subject": "Seven Years Old", "text": "I.\n\nSEVEN white roses on one tree,\nSeven white loaves of blameless leaven,\nSeven white sails on one soft sea,\nSeven white swans on one lake\u2019s lee,\nSeven white flowerlike stars in heaven,\nAll are types unmeet to be\nFor a birthday\u2019s crown of seven.\n\nII.\n\nNot the radiance of the roses,\nNot the blessing of the bread,\nNot the breeze that ere day grows is\nFresh for sails and swans, and closes\nWings above the sun\u2019s grave spread,\nWhen the starshine on the snows is\nSweet as sleep on sorrow shed,\n\nIII.\n\nNothing sweetest, nothing best,\nHolds so good and sweet a treasure\nAs the love wherewith once blest\nJoy grows holy, grief takes rest,\nLife, half tired with hours to measure,\nFills his eyes and lips and breast\nWith most light and breath of pleasure\n\nIV.\n\nAs the rapture unpolluted,\nAs the passion undefiled,\nBy whose force all pains heart-rooted\nAre transfigured and transmuted,\nRecompensed and reconciled,\nThrough the imperial, undisputed,\nPresent godhead of a child.\n\nV.\n\nBrown bright eyes and fair bright head,\nWorth a worthier crown than this is,\nWorth a worthier song instead,\nSweet grave wise round mouth, full fed\nWith the joy of love, whose bliss is\nMore than mortal wine and bread,\nLips whose words are sweet as kisses,\n\nVI.\n\nLittle hands so glad of giving,\nLittle heart so glad of love,\nLittle soul so glad of living,\nWhile the strong swift hours are weaving\nLight with darkness woven above,\nTime for mirth and time for grieving,\nPlume of raven and plume of dove,\n\nVII.\n\nI can give you but a word\nWarm with love therein for leaven,\nBut a song that falls unheard\nYet on ears of sense unstirred\nYet by song so far from heaven,\nWhence you came the brightest bird,\nSeven years since, of seven times seven."}
