{"subject": "Present And Future", "text": "Look, as a mother bending o'er her boy,\nThe sleeping boy that in her bosom lies,\nGazes upon him in a trance of joy\nWith earnest, infinitely tender eyes,\nLost in her deep love, and aware of nought,\nEarth and the sunlight, men and trees and skies\nQuite faded out from her impassioned thought;\nYet knows one day it will be otherwise,\nWhen, laid alone within the narrow tomb,\nDeath leaves her none to love; but in youth's bloom,\nOr grown to manhood and to strength, her son\nOver the same earth that has closed on her\nRejoicing wanders on,\nAnd strikes fresh tracks of thronged and fruitful life,\nNor frets at the sweet need for change and strife,\nWith eager mind and glowing heart astir\nIn ardour ever to pursue\nPassions and actions, and adventures new:\nSo is the Present Age,\nSo strives she for that Age to come, her child.\nWhich knows not yet the pain, the sacrifice,\nShe for its sake endures; it knows not yet,\nBut must one day, the battles it must wage.\nAnd she, if it within its sleep have smiled,\nIs happy in her woes: no vain regret\nSaps the sad strength with which she labours still\nFor that imagined bliss she shall not see,\nSo dear, so deeply hoped--for though it be.\nAnd ever with unconquerable will,\nBearing her burden, toward one distant star\nShe moves in her desire; and though with pain\nShe labour, and the goal she dreams be far,\nProud is she in her passionate soul to know\nThat from her tears, her very sorrows grow\nThe joy, the hope, the peace of future men."}
