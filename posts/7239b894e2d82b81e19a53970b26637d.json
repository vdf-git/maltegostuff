{"subject": "Baby's Dreams (Second Version)", "text": "WHAT doth the Moon, so lily white,\nBusily weave this summer night?\n'Silver ropes and diamond strands\nFor Baby's pink and dimpled hands;\nCords for her rosy palms to hold\nWhile she floats, she flies,\nTo Dreamland, set with its shores of gold,\nWith its buds like stars shaken out of the skies,\nWhere the trees have tongues and the flowers have lips\nTo coax, to kiss\nThe velvet cheek of the Babe who slips\nThro' the Dream-gate up to a land like this.'\n\nWhat is the mild Sea whispering clear\nIn the rosy shell of Baby's ear?\nSee! she laughs in her dimpled sleep.\nWhat does she hear from the shining deep?\n'Thy father comes a-sailing, a-sailing, a-sailing,\nSafely comes a-sailing from islands fair and far.\nO Baby, bid thy mother cease her tears and bitter\nwailing:\nThe sailor's wife's his only port, his babe his beacon\nstar!'\n\nSoftly the Wind doth blow;\nWhat say its murmurs low?\nWhat doth it bring\nOn the wide, soft plume of its dewy wing?\n'Only scented blisses\nOf innocent, sweet kisses\nFor such a cheek as this is,\nOf Baby in her nest,\nFrom all the dreaming flowers,\nA-nodding in their bowers,\nOr bright on leafy towers,\nWhere the fairy monarchs rest.\nBut chiefly I bring,\nOn my fresh, sweet mouth,\nHer father's kiss,\nAs he sails from the south.\nHe hitherward blew it at break of day;\nI lay it, Babe, on thy tender lip;\nI'll steal another and hie away,\nAnd kiss it to him on his wave-rocked ship.\n\n'I saw a fairy twine,\nOf star-white jessamine,\nA dainty seat, shaped like an airy swing,\nWith two round yellow stars\nAgainst the misty bars\nOf night; she nailed it high\nIn the pansy-purple sky,\nWith four taps of her little rainbow wing.\nTo and fro\nThat swing I'll blow.\n'The baby moon in the amethyst sky\nWill laugh at us as we float and fly,\nAnd stretch her silver arms and try\nTo catch the earth-babe swinging by.'"}
