{"subject": "Dunce Songs : 9", "text": "Love me little, love me long,\nThen we neither can be wrong:\nYou in giving, I in taking;\nThere is nor a heart breaking\nBut remembers one touch,\nOr maybe seven, of too much.\n\nLove me more than halfway, though.\nLet me think, then let me know.\nAnd I promise you the same:\nA little wild, a little tame;\nLest it ever seem long:\nTick, tock, ding, dong."}
