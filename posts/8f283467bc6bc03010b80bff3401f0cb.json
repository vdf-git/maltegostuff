{"subject": "I Find No Peace", "text": "I find no peace, and all my war is done.\nI fear and hope. I burn and freeze like ice.\nI fly above the wind, yet can I not arise;\nAnd nought I have, and all the world I season.\nThat loseth nor locketh holdeth me in prison\nAnd holdeth me not-yet can I scape no wise-\nNor letteth me live nor die at my device,\nAnd yet of death it giveth me occasion.\nWithout eyen I see, and without tongue I plain.\nI desire to perish, and yet I ask health.\nI love another, and thus I hate myself.\nI feed me in sorrow and laugh in all my pain;\nLikewise displeaseth me both life and death,\nAnd my delight is causer of this strife."}
