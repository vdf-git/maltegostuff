{"subject": "A Worldly Death-Bed", "text": "Hush! speak in accents soft and low,\nAnd treat with careful stealth\nThro\u2019 that rich curtained room which tells\nOf luxury and wealth;\nMen of high science and of skill\nStand there with saddened brow,\nExchanging some low whispered words\u2014\nWhat can their art do now? \n\nFollow their gaze to yonder couch\nWhere moans in fitful pain\nThe mistress of this splendid home,\nWith aching heart and brain.\nThe fever burning in her veins\nTinges with carmine bright\nThat sunken cheek\u2014alas! she needs\nNo borrowed bloom to-night. \n\nThe masses of her raven hair\nFall down on either side\nIn tangled richness\u2014it has been\nThrough life her care and pride;\nAnd those small perfect hands on which\nHer gaze complacent fell,\nNow, clenched within her pillow\u2019s lace,\nOf anguish only tell. \n\nSad was her restless, fev\u2019rish sleep,\nMore sad her waking still,\nAs with wild start she looks around\nHer chamber darkened\u2014still;\nIts silence and the mournful looks\nOf those who stand apart,\nSome awful fear seem to suggest\nTo that poor worldly heart. \n\n\u201cDoctor, I\u2019m better, am I not?\u201d\nShe gasps with failing breath\u2014\nAlas! the answer sternly tells\nThat she is \u201cill to death.\u201d\n\u201cWhat! dying!\u201d and her eyes gleam forth\nA flashing, fearful ray,\n\u201cI, young, rich, lovely, from this earth\nTo pass so soon away? \n\n\u201cNo, no, it must not, cannot be,\nSurely your skill can save\u2014\nCan stand between me and the gloom,\nThe horrors, of the grave!\u201d\nBreathless she listens, but no word\nBreaks that dull pause of grief,\u2014\nHer pitying listeners turn away,\nThey cannot give relief \n\nTossing aloft, in fierce despair,\nHer arms, with frenzied cry,\nShe gasps forth, \u201cSave me\u2014help, O help!\nI must not, will not die.\u201d\nBut One can grant that wild appeal,\nCan stay her failing breath\u2014\nOf Him she never thought in life\nNor thinks she now in death. \n\nWithout one prayer, one contrite tear,\nFor past faults to atone\u2014\nFor wasted talents, misspent life,\nShe\u2019s gone before God\u2019s throne!\nPrying that wilful, wayward heart\nThat leaned on gods of clay,\nFor calmer, holier death than hers\nWith solemn heart we pray."}
