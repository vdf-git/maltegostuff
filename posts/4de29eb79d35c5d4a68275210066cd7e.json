{"subject": "The Ballad Of The Harp-Weaver", "text": "\"Son,\" said my mother,\nWhen I was knee-high,\n\"you've need of clothes to cover you,\nand not a rag have I.\n\n\"There's nothing in the house\nTo make a boy breeches,\nNor shears to cut a cloth with,\nNor thread to take stitches.\n\n\"There's nothing in the house\nBut a loaf-end of rye,\nAnd a harp with a woman's head\nNobody will buy,\"\nAnd she began to cry.\n\nThat was in the early fall.\nWhen came the late fall,\n\"Son,\" she said, \"the sight of you\nMakes your mother's blood crawl,\u2014\n\n\"Little skinny shoulder-blades\nSticking through your clothes!\nAnd where you'll get a jacket from\nGod above knows.\n\n\"It's lucky for me, lad,\nYour daddy's in the ground,\nAnd can't see the way I let\nHis son go around!\"\nAnd she made a queer sound.\n\nThat was in the late fall.\nWhen the winter came,\nI'd not a pair of breeches\nNor a shirt to my name.\n\nI couldn't go to school,\nOr out of doors to play.\nAnd all the other little boys\nPassed our way.\n\n\"Son,\" said my mother,\n\"Come, climb into my lap,\nAnd I'll chafe your little bones\nWhile you take a nap.\"\n\nAnd, oh, but we were silly\nFor half and hour or more,\nMe with my long legs,\nDragging on the floor,\n\nA-rock-rock-rocking\nTo a mother-goose rhyme!\nOh, but we were happy\nFor half an hour's time!\n\nBut there was I, a great boy,\nAnd what would folks say\nTo hear my mother singing me\nTo sleep all day,\nIn such a daft way?\n\nMen say the winter\nWas bad that year;\nFuel was scarce,\nAnd food was dear.\n\nA wind with a wolf's head\nHowled about our door,\nAnd we burned up the chairs\nAnd sat upon the floor.\n\nAll that was left us\nWas a chair we couldn't break,\nAnd the harp with a woman's head\nNobody would take,\nFor song or pity's sake.\n\nThe night before Christmas\nI cried with cold,\nI cried myself to sleep \nLike a two-year old.\n\nAnd in the deep night\nI felt my mother rise,\nAnd stare down upon me\nWith love in her eyes.\n\nI saw my mother sitting\nOn the one good chair,\nA light falling on her\nFrom I couldn't tell where.\n\nLooking nineteen,\nAnd not a day older,\nAnd the harp with a woman's head\nLeaned against her shoulder.\n\nHer thin fingers, moving\nIn the thin, tall strings,\nWere weav-weav-weaving\nWonderful things.\n\nMany bright threads,\nFrom where I couldn't see,\nWere running through the harp-strings\nRapidly,\n\nAnd gold threads whistling\nThrough my mother's hand.\nI saw the web grow,\nAnd the pattern expand.\n\nShe wove a child's jacket,\nAnd when it was done\nShe laid it on the floor\nAnd wove another one.\n\nShe wove a red cloak\nSo regal to see,\n\"She's made it for a king's son,\"\nI said, \"and not for me.\"\nBut I knew it was for me.\n\nShe wove a pair of breeches\nQuicker than that!\nShe wove a pair of boots\nAnd a little cocked hat.\n\nShe wove a pair of mittens,\nShw wove a little blouse,\nShe wove all night\nIn the still, cold house.\n\nShe sang as she worked,\nAnd the harp-strings spoke;\nHer voice never faltered,\nAnd the thread never broke,\nAnd when I awoke,\u2014\n\nThere sat my mother\nWith the harp against her shoulder,\nLooking nineteeen,\nAnd not a day older, \n\nA smile about her lips,\nAnd a light about her head,\nAnd her hands in the harp-strings\nFrozen dead.\n\nAnd piled beside her\nAnd toppling to the skies,\nWere the clothes of a king's son,\nJust my size."}
