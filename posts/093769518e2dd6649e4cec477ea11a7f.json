{"subject": "Never Or Now", "text": "AN APPEAL\n\nLISTEN, young heroes! your country is calling!\nTime strikes the hour for the brave and the true!\nNow, while the foremost are fighting and falling,\nFill up the ranks that have opened for you!\n\nYou whom the fathers made free and defended,\nStain not the scroll that emblazons their fame\nYou whose fair heritage spotless descended,\nLeave not your children a birthright of shame!\n\nStay not for questions while Freedom stands gasping!\nWait not till Honor lies wrapped in his pall!\nBrief the lips' meeting be, swift the hands' clasping,--\n'Off for the wars!' is enough for them all!\n\nBreak from the arms that would fondly caress you!\nHark! 't is the bugle-blast, sabres are drawn!\nMothers shall pray for you, fathers shall bless you,\nMaidens shall weep for you when you are gone!\n\nNever or now! cries the blood of a nation,\nPoured on the turf where the red rose should bloom;\nNow is the day and the hour of salvation,--\nNever or now! peals the trumpet of doom!\n\nNever or now! roars the hoarse-throated cannon\nThrough the black canopy blotting the skies;\nNever or now! flaps the shell-blasted pennon\nO'er the deep ooze where the Cumberland lies!\n\nFrom the foul dens where our brothers are dying,\nAliens and foes in the land of their birth,--\nFrom the rank swamps where our martyrs are lying\nPleading in vain for a handful of earth,--\n\nFrom the hot plains where they perish outnumbered,\nFurrowed and ridged by the battle-field's plough,\nComes the loud summons; too long you have slumbered,\nHear the last Angel-trump,--Never or Now!"}
