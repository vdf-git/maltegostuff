{"subject": "A Song Of The Degrees", "text": "I\nRest me with Chinese colours,\nFor I think the glass is evil.\n\nII\nThe wind moves above the wheat-\nWith a silver crashing,\nA thin war of metal.\n\nI have known the golden disc,\nI have seen it melting above me.\nI have known the stone-bright place,\nThe hall of clear colours.\n\nIII\nO glass subtly evil, O confusion of colours !\nO light bound and bent in, soul of the captive,\nWhy am I warned? Why am I sent away?\nWhy is your glitter full of curious mistrust?\nO glass subtle and cunning, O powdery gold!\nO filaments of amber, two-faced iridescence!"}
