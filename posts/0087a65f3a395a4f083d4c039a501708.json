{"subject": "Poem", "text": "This poem is not addressed to you. \nYou may come into it briefly, \nBut no one will find you here, no one. \nYou will have changed before the poem will. \n\nEven while you sit there, unmovable, \nYou have begun to vanish. And it does not matter. \nThe poem will go on without you. \nIt has the spurious glamor of certain voids. \n\nIt is not sad, really, only empty. \nOnce perhaps it was sad, no one knows why. \nIt prefers to remember nothing. \nNostalgias were peeled from it long ago. \n\nYour type of beauty has no place here. \nNight is the sky over this poem. \nIt is too black for stars. \nAnd do not look for any illumination. \n\nYou neither can nor should understand what it means. \nListen, it comes with out guitar, \nNeither in rags nor any purple fashion. \nAnd there is nothing in it to comfort you. \n\nClose your eyes, yawn. It will be over soon. \nYou will forge the poem, but not before \nIt has forgotten you. And it does not matter. \nIt has been most beautiful in its erasures. \n\nO bleached mirrors! Oceans of the drowned! \nNor is one silence equal to another. \nAnd it does not matter what you think. \nThis poem is not addressed to you."}
