{"subject": "Hotel Insomnia", "text": "I liked my little hole,\nIts window facing a brick wall.\nNext door there was a piano.\nA few evenings a month\na crippled old man came to play\n\"My Blue Heaven.\"\n\nMostly, though, it was quiet.\nEach room with its spider in heavy overcoat\nCatching his fly with a web\nOf cigarette smoke and revery.\nSo dark,\nI could not see my face in the shaving mirror.\n\nAt 5 A.M. the sound of bare feet upstairs.\nThe \"Gypsy\" fortuneteller,\nWhose storefront is on the corner,\nGoing to pee after a night of love.\nOnce, too, the sound of a child sobbing.\nSo near it was, I thought\nFor a moment, I was sobbing myself."}
