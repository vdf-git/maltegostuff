{"subject": "Hymn 100", "text": "Believe and be saved.\n\nJohn 3:16-18. \n\nNot to condemn the sons of men,\nDid Christ, the Son of God, appear;\nNo weapons in his hands are seen,\nNo flaming sword nor thunder there.\n\nSuch was the pity of our God,\nHe loved the race of man so well,\nHe sent his Son to bear our load\nOf sins, and save our souls from hell.\n\nSinners, believe the Savior's word,\nTrust in his mighty name and live;\nA thousand joys his lips afford,\nHis hands a thousand blessings give.\n\nBut vengeance and damnation lies\nOn rebels who refuse the grace;\nWho God's eternal Son despise,\nThe hottest hell shall be their place."}
