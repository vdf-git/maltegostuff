{"subject": "Self", "text": "This is my chiefest torment, that behind\nThe brave and subtle spirit, the swift brain,\nThere sits and shivers, in a cell of pain,\nA groping atom, melancholy, blind,\nWhich is myself; -- though, when spring suns are kind,\nAnd rich leaves riot in the genial rain,\nI cheat him, dreaming: slip my rigorous chain,\nFree as a skiff before the dancing wind.\nThen he awakes: and vexed that I am glad,\nIn dreary malice strains some nimble cord,\nPricks his thin claw within some delicate nerve;\nAnd all at once I falter, start, and swerve\nFrom my true course, to fall, unmanned and sad,\nInto gross darkness, tangible, abhorred."}
