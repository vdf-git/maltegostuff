{"subject": "Even-Star", "text": "First-born and final relic of the night,\nI dwell aloof in dim immensity;\nThe grey sky sparkles with my fairy light;\nI mix among the dancers of the sea;\nYet stoop not from the throne I must retain\nHigh o'er the silver sources of the rain.\nVicissitude I know not, nor can know,\nYet much discern strewed everywhere around;\nThe ever-stirring race of men below\nMuch do I watch, and wish I were not bound\nThe chainless captive of this lonely spot,\nWhere light-winged Mutability is not.\nI see great cities rise, which being hoar\nAre slowly rendered unto dust again;\nAnd roaring billows preying on the shore;\nAnd virgin isles ascending from the main;\nThe passing wave of the perpetual river;\nAnd men depart, and man remaining ever.\nThe upturned eyes of many a mortal maid\nGlass me in gathering tears, soon kissed away;\nThen walks she for a space, and then is laid\nSwelling the bosom of the quiet clay.\nI muse what this all-kindling Love may be,\nAnd what this Death that never comes to me."}
