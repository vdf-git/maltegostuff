{"subject": "Early Kansas Impressionists", "text": "Silly now, when she visits\ndreams, or I visit her, my mother,\nin new condos at brief's edge\nwhere the neon restaurant's lawn\nshallows with winter. She laughs\nin the expanse, wordless, collapsing\ninto snow to wave arms and legs,\ncraft a figure. I do the same,\nlike an infant learning its body.\nDusting off, I rise and she's gone\nevery time. I see our shapes\nthen, mine a mimicry of myself,\nhers a rectangular silence,\ninhuman, without room\nfor rage shame guilt or scold,\nthe curves that let us recognize\neach other in the air, O,\nin our dynamic world today."}
