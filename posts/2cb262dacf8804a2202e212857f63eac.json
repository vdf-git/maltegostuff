{"subject": "Our Rampant Coat-Of-Arms", "text": "The Lion and the Unicorn\nOf England's Coat-of-Arms\nSeldom make bold, so we are told,\nTo ravage English farms.\nIn fact, 'tis said by travellers\nWho lately have been there,\nThat lions hardly ever roam\nAbout the dales and dells at Home,\nAnd unicorns are rare.\n\nBut in this topsy-turvy land\nWhere often - inter alia \nStrange forms of bird, in ways absurd,\n Are grafted to mammalia.\nAnd beasts have bills to fit the goose,\nOur crazy Coat-of-Arms breaks loose\nTo roam at night and play the deuce\n'Mid farmers in Australia.\n\nThe Lion and the Unicorn\nStay put and emplematic;\nBut kangaroos bluntly refuse\nTo function, staid and static.\nAnd emus stray to ruin farms,\nRaising excursions and alarms;\nWhich proves such things, on Coats-of-Arms\nAre plainly too erratic.\n\nFar better chain them to the shield\nLike unicorns in Britain.\nElse, by what chance may we 'advance'\nAs in the motto written?\nIf not, and they get out of hand,\nBefore the nations we must stand\nEver a topsy-turvy land\nBy its own emblem smitten."}
