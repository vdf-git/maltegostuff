{"subject": "The Foolish Harebell", "text": "A harebell hung her wilful head:\n'I am tired, so tired! I wish I was dead.'\n\nShe hung her head in the mossy dell:\n'If all were over, then all were well!'\n\nThe Wind he heard, and was pitiful,\nAnd waved her about to make her cool.\n\n'Wind, you are rough!' said the dainty Bell;\n'Leave me alone-I am not well.'\n\nThe Wind, at the word of the drooping dame,\nSighed to himself and ceased in shame.\n\n'I am hot, so hot!' she moaned and said;\n'I am withering up; I wish I was dead!'\n\nThen the Sun he pitied her woeful case,\nAnd drew a thick veil over his face.\n\n'Cloud go away, and don't be rude,'\nShe said; 'I do not see why you should!'\n\nThe Cloud withdrew. Then the Harebell cried,\n'I am faint, so faint!-and no water beside!'\n\nThe Dew came down its millionfold path:\nShe murmured, 'I did not want a bath!'\n\nThe Dew went up; the Wind softly crept;\nThe Night came down, and the Harebell slept.\n\nA boy ran past in the morning gray,\nPlucked the Harebell, and threw her away.\n\nThe Harebell shivered, and sighed, 'Oh! oh!\nI am faint indeed! Come, dear Wind, blow.'\n\nThe Wind blew gently, and did not speak.\nShe thanked him kindly, but grew more weak.\n\n'Sun, dear Sun, I am cold!' she said.\nHe shone; but lower she drooped her head.\n\n'O Rain, I am withering! all the blue\nIs fading out of me!-come, please do!'\n\nThe Rain came down as fast as he could,\nBut for all his good will he could do her no good.\n\nShe shuddered and shrivelled, and moaning said,\n'Thank you all kindly!' and then she was dead.\n\nLet us hope, let us hope when she comes next year\nShe'll be simple and sweet! But I fear, I fear!"}
