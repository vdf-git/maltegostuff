The companions had become weary of his reproaches but had no other remedy than to bear them; and one of them who was a pious man remarked: \u2018It is more easy to pacify a hungry stomach with promises of food than a grain dealer with promises of money.\u2019\n\n            It is preferable to be without the bounty of a gentleman  \n            Than to bear the insults of the gate-keepers.  \n            It is better to die wishing for meat  \n            Than to endure the expostulations of butchers."}
