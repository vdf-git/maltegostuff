{"subject": "Filio Desideratissimo", "text": "When I paint thee what thou might'st be,\nWhen I think on what thou art,\nTrace thine image in my memory,\nSearch that memory through mine heart,--\nThen I feel, how widely parted\nIs that other side from this:\nWhat a gulf divides our fancy\nFrom that unimagined bliss.\n\nSometimes by my side thou walkest,\nGrown a stripling tall and fair,\nGodlike in thine youthful beauty,\nBut oh not as thou art there!\nAll thine interests springing in thee,\nGushing toward me fresh and clear,\nFancy--drawn from things around me,\nSpeak not of that nobler sphere.\n\nDay by day, and every moment\nAlways present, never sought,\nStanding, looking, speaking, loving,\nGliding through the realms of thought,\nO my child, my spirit's presence,\nDearest comfort, nearest joy,\nAll these nine long years where art thou,\nWhere, and what, mine angel boy?"}
