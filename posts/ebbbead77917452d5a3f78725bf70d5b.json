{"subject": "Winter Evening", "text": "Behind yellow windows shadows drink hot tea.\nYearning people sway on a hardened pond\nWorkers find a soft woman's corpse.\nGlowing blue snows cast a howling darkness.\nOn high poles a scarecrow, implored, hangs.\nStores flicker dimly through frosted windows,\nIn front of which human bodies move like ghosts.\nStudents carve a frozen girl.\nHow lovely, the crystalline winter evening burning!\nA platinum moon now streams through a gap in the houses.\nNext to green lanterns under a bridge\nLies a gypsy woman. And plays an instrument."}
