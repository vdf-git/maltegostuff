{"subject": "The Open Door", "text": "O Mystery of life,\nThat, after all our strife,\nDefeats, mistakes,\nJust as, at last, we see\nThe road to victory,\nThe tired heart breaks.\n\nJust as the long years give\nKnowledge of how to live,\nLife's end draws near;\nAs if, that gift being ours,\nGod needed our new powers\nIn worlds elsewhere.\n\nThere, if the soul whose wings\nWere won in suffering, springs\nTo life anew,\nJustice would have some room\nFor hope beyond the tomb,\nAnd mercy, too.\n\nAnd since, without this dream\nNo light, no faintest gleam\nAnswers our 'why';\nBut earth and all its race\nMust pass and leave no trace\nOn that blind sky;\n\nShall reason close that door\nOn all we struggled for,\nSeal the soul's doom;\nMake of this universe\nOne wild answering curse,\nOne lampless tomb?\n\nMine be the dream, the creed\nThat leaves for God, indeed,\nFor God, and man,\nOne open door whereby\nTo prove His world no lie\nAnd crown His plan."}
