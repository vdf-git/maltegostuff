{"subject": "The Couple", "text": "They switch off the light and its white shade\n\nglimmers for a moment before dissolving\n\nlike a tablet in a glass of darkness. Then up.\n\nThe hotel walls rise into the black sky.\n\nThe movements of love have settled, and they sleep\n\nbut their most secret thoughts meet as when\n\ntwo colors meet and flow into each other\n\non the wet paper of a schoolboy\u2019s painting.\n\nIt is dark and silent. But the town has pulled closer\n\ntonight. With quenched windows. The houses have approached.\n\nThey stand close up in a throng, waiting,\n\na crowd whose faces have no expressions.\nTranslation by Robin Fulton"}
