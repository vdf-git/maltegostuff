{"subject": "Your Last Drive", "text": "Here by the moorway you returned,\nAnd saw the borough lights ahead\nThat lit your face - all undiscerned\nTo be in a week the face of the dead,\nAnd you told of the charm of that haloed view\nThat never again would beam on you.\nAnd on your left you passed the spot\nWhere eight days later you were to lie,\nAnd be spoken of as one who was not;\nBeholding it with a cursory eye\nAs alien from you, though under its tree\nYou soon would halt everlastingly.\nI drove not with you\u2026. Yet had I sat\nAt your side that eve I should not have seen\nThat the countenance I was glancing at\nHad a last-time look in the flickering sheen,\nNor have read the writing upon your face,\n'I go hence soon to my resting-place;\n'You may miss me then. But I shall not know\nHow many times you visit me there,\nOr what your thoughts are, or if you go\nThere never at all. And I shall not care.\nShould you censure me I shall take no heed\nAnd even your praises I shall not need.'\nTrue: never you'll know. And you will not mind.\nBut shall I then slight you because of such?\nDear ghost, in the past did you ever find\nMe one whom consequence influenced much?\nYet the fact indeed remains the same,\nYou are past love, praise, indifference, blame."}
