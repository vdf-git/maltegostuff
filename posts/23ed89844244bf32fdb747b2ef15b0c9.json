{"subject": "A Passage In The Moriae Encomium Of Erasmus. Imitated", "text": "In awful pomp and melancholy state,\nSee settled Reason on the judgement-seat;\nAround her crowd Distrust, and Doubt, and Fear,\nAnd thoughtful Foresight, and tormenting Care;\nFar from the throne the trembling Pleasures stand,\nChain'd up or exiled by her stern command.\nWretched her subjects, gloomy sits the queen,\nTill happy chance reverts the cruel scene;\nAnd apish Folly, with her wild resort\nOf wit and jest, disturbs the solemn court.\n\nSee the fantastic Minstrelsy advance\nTo breathe the song and animate the dance.\nBless'd the usurper! happy the surprise!\nHer mimic postures catch our eager eyes;\nHer jingling bells affect our captive ear,\nAnd in the sights we see and sounds we hear,\nAgainst our judgement she our sense employs,\nThe laws of troubled reason she drestroys,\nAnd in their place rejoices to indite\nWild schemes of mirth and plans of loose delight."}
