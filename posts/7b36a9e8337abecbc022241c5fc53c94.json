{"subject": "The Castle Ruins At Balaklava", "text": "These castles, whose remains are strewn in heaps for miles, \nOnce graced and guarded you, Crimea the ungrateful! \nToday they sit upon the hills, each like a great skull\nIn which reptiles reside or men worse than reptiles.\n\u00a0\nLet\u2019s climb a tower, search for crests upon worn tiles, \nFor an inscription or a hero\u2019s name, the fateful\nBane of armies now forgotten by the faithful, \nA wizened beetle wrapped in vines below the aisles.\n\u00a0\nHere Greeks wrought Attic ornaments upon the walls, \nFrom which Italians would cast Mongols into chains, \nAnd where the Mecca-bound once stopped to pray and beg.\n\u00a0\nToday above the tombs the shadow of night falls, \nThe black-winged buzzards fly like pennants over plains, \nAs if towards a city ever touched by plague.\n\n\n\u2014 translated from the Polish by Leo Yankevich\nfirst appeared in the Sarmatian Review \n                        \n"}
