{"subject": "The Comet", "text": "SPECTRAL, mysterious, flame-like thing\n  Cleaving the western night,\nWaking from chrysalis-dream to fling\nOut of thy spirit's long chastening\n  Far-flashing streams of light,\n\nTell us thy thought of the things that are;\n  How doth the morning sing?\nWhat hast thou seen in the worlds afar?\nTell us thy dream, O thou silvery star,\n  Bird with the white-flame wing.\n\nWhat though the glow of thy fading ray\n  Dim and elusive seem,\nConstant thou art to the sun's bright sway\nFaithful and true in thy tireless way,\n  True in thy spectral gleam.\n\nRising anew from thine ancient pyre,\n  Vapour and dust thy frame,\nStill art thou Psyche, the soul's desire,\nWingless, save when from reefs of fire\n  Mounting in shaft of flame."}
