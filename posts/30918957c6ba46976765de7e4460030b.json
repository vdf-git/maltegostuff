{"subject": "So Slow To Die", "text": "THE RAINBOW on the ocean\nA moment bright,\nThe nightingale\u2019s devotion \nThat dies on night,\n\nEve\u2019s rosy star a-tremble\nIts hour of light,\u2014\nAll things that love resemble\nToo soon take flight. \n\nThe violets we cherish\nDied in the spring;\nRoses and lilies perish\nIn what they bring;\nAnd joy and beauty wholly \nWith life depart;\nBut love leaves slow, how slowly!\nLife\u2019s empty heart.\n\nO, strange to me, and wondrous,\nThe storm passed by, \nWith sound of voices thund\u2019rous\nSwept from the sky;\nBut stranger, love, thy fashion,\u2014\nO, tell me why\nArt thou, dark storm of passion, \nSo slow to die?\n\nAs roll the billowy ridges\nWhen the great gale has blown o\u2019er;\nAs the long winter-dirges\nFrom frozen branches pour; \nAs the whole sea\u2019s harsh December\nPounds on the pine-hung shore;\nSo will love\u2019s deep remember,\nSo will deep love deplore."}
