{"subject": "Brazilian Telephone", "text": "In the peach orchard in an old bathtub\nthe children are standing someone\nin a bath of salt water, and one\ngently attaches electrodes\nto the nipples of the one\nin the bath. Out of the weeds runs one\nwith a rescued battery from the old\nmotor home, which they had gotten\nto rev its engine like the sad bleating\nof a goat. If, later, anyone asks\nhow they learned to do this, in a striped shirt one\nwill say, Oh, I was looking for science\nexperiments in those old textbooks someone\ngot from the library book sale last year.\nI have been baking all day,\nand in a few minutes will start to wonder\nwhat happened to that box of coarse kosher salt\nI got just last week.\nThe children are all singing\nsome ditty from a musical\nwe saw at the community theater\na few days ago, and, in the tub the one\nwith electrodes affixed so gently\nto his chest is calling\nout little mews of uncertainty,\nis calling and calling into the sundown\npast the knotted trees with their hairy\nfruits, green and hard. Hush,\nhush, don't worry, another one\nis saying, fingernail following a line of text\nin a complicated book. I think this one\nis called the Brazilian Telephone, one\nsays, connecting finally,\nafter all this build-up, the ends of two\nwires to the battery terminals\nwhich, with steel wool stolen from the kitchen,\nthey had cleaned so carefully\nearlier in the day."}
