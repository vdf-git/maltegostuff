{"subject": "Numa Pompilius", "text": "O well is thee! King Numa,\nWithin thy secret cave,\nWhere thy bones are ever moistened\nBy sad Egeria\u2019s wave;\nNone now have power to pilfer\nThe treasure of thy tomb,\nAnd reveal the institutions\nAnd secret Rites of Rome.\nO blessed be the Senate\nThat stowed those books away,\nCurst be the attempt of Niebuhr\nTo drag them into day;\nLight be the pressure, Numa,\nAround thy watery bed,\nMay no perplexing problems\nInfest thy kingly head!\nAs thus I blessed King Numa\nAnd struggled hard with sleep,\nI felt unwonted chillness\nO\u2019er all my members creep;\nBefore mine eyes in fragments\nThe fireplace seemed to roll,\nThe chillness left my body\nAnd slid into my soul.\nDeep in Egeria's grotto\nI saw the darksome well;\nI slowly sunk to Numa,\nBut why I cannot tell.\n\n\"What! Livest thou still, old Sabine,\nWith thy mysterious wife?\"\n\"Yes, here beneath the surface,\nWe lead a torpid life.\nBut little think the Critics\nWho nullify old Rome,\nThat in these benumbing waters\nI always lived at home.\nNever was I a Sabine,\nOr lived like men above;\nNo mortal wight was Numa,\nWho quelled the fear of Jove.\nBefore my day the Romans\nServed gods of wood and stone,\nBut what each man had fashioned\nThat worshipped he alone;\nWith care he saved the silver,\nWith pains the mould designed,\nHe loved and feared the offspring\nOf his pocket and his mind.\nTo him he went for counsel\nAnd then to Common Sense;\nWhen both of these had failed him\nHe took to tossing pence;\nBut I forbade all tossing,\nMade men enquire of beasts,\nPulled down all private idols\nAnd set up public priests.\nBirds, too,\u2019 said I, \u2018are holy,\nThey show us things to come,\nThey have more subtle spirits\nThan wooden idols dumb.\nNo longer burn your incense\nBefore your private shrine,\nMy Vestals are most careful\nTo feed the flame divine;\nDismiss all fear of idols,\nOf demons, and of gods,\nMy Augurs will protect you\nWith their long crooked rods.\n(With such the careful shepherd\nDrags lambs from ditches deep;\nWith such he points to heaven\nWhen they are fast asleep.)\nO, trust me, those same Augurs\nKnow more about the stars\nThan you whose only business\nIs everlasting wars.\nHow can you be religious,\nHow can they work for bread?\nYou sinners must be shriven,\nMy Augurs must be fed.\nYou know dividing labour\nTo nations riches brings,\nSo let my Augurs shrive you\nWhile you mind earthly things.\nYour case I\u2019ve set before you,\nYou see the thing to do,\nIf you fork out the needful,\nThey do your job for you.\u2019\nWith this and other speeches\nI brought the people round,\nTill not a single Roman\nIn Jove\u2019s house can be found.\nFor well he knows each evening\nWhen bells in steeples toll,\n\u2019Tis a sign that well-paid Augurs\nAre helping on his soul.\n\u2019Twas this that kept \u2019em quiet\nThrough all my fabled reign,\nTill quarrelsome young Tullus\nBrought battles back again.\nThus my cold-blooded doctrines\nThe fear of Jove could quell,\nWonder not then to find me\nAlive here in a well.\""}
