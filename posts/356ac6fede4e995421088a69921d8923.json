{"subject": "Confederate Memorial Day", "text": "The marching armies of the past\nAlong our Southern plains,\nAre sleeping now in quiet rest\nBeneath the Southern rains.\n\nThe bugle call is now in vain\nTo rouse them from their bed;\nTo arms they'll never march again-\nThey are sleeping with the dead.\n\nNo more will Shiloh's plains be stained\nWith blood our heroes shed,\nNor Chancellorsville resound again\nTo our noble warriors' tread.\n\nFor them no more shall reveille\nSound at the break of dawn,\nBut may their sleep peaceful be\nTill God's great judgment morn.\n\nWe bow our heads in solemn prayer\nFor those who wore the gray,\nAnd clasp again their unseen hands\nOn our Memorial Day."}
