{"subject": "The Daughters Of Time", "text": "The daughters of Time have shot me, from where I do not see\nAnd what of him who is shot at, and he's not shooting?\nHad they been arrows I would have averted them\nBut I am being shot at by what is not darts.\nIf people saw they would say: Wasn't he\nYouthful, sharp-sighted, unflagging?\nSo I waste away and I don't waste even a single night of Time\nYet it did not yield, what I wasted, even a stringing-thread\nAnd it has worn me out the hoping for a night and a day\nAnd the hoping for a year, thereafter, and a year."}
