{"subject": "An Acrostic On Sir Peter Warren, Admiral, On Board The Invincible At Sea.", "text": "Sadly dejected, fair Britannia sat,\nImploring thus the Genius of her State,\nRise to my Aid, she cry'd, some Hero rise,\n\nProtect my Person, and my Foes chastize:\nEach Bosom heav'd a Sigh, with Fear dismay'd,\nTill George arose to save the drooping Maid:\nElate with Joy, Britannia view'd the Chief,\nResolv'd to perish, or to end her Grief:\n\nWarren, he said, 's my Substitute to save,\nAs cool in Council, as in Action brave;\nRouz'd to the War, my Thunder he shall pour,\nRound Gallia's Coast, and proud Iberia's Shore;\nExacting Vengeance with so strict a Hand,\nNor more thy Foes can give, nor Thou demand."}
