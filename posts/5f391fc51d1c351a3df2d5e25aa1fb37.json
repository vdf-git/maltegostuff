{"subject": "Tranquility", "text": "Holding the thought before it\nis born. Let the void become\npregenant first-\nand it starts raining.\n\nIt was a serene melting\npoint, when I accepted the price\nof giving away. I will not\ntake any mantra, any hand.\n\nA perfect blending with\nunknown; to put back the\nsea in a bowl. Even the cloud\nwill enter into a blade of grass.\n\nNo faith. No ritual. I believe\nin roving dust, which makes\nthe stars, the blaze, and\nthe brilliant light."}
