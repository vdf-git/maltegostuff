{"subject": "Sonnet 99: When Far-Spent Night", "text": "When far-spent night persuades each mortal eye, \nTo whom nor art nor nature granted light, \nTo lay his then mark-wanting shafts of sight, \nClos'd with their quivers, in sleep's armory; \n\nWith windows ope then most my mind doth lie, \nViewing the shape of darkness and delight, \nTakes in that sad hue which the inward night \nOf his maz'd powers keeps perfect harmony; \n\nBut when birds charm, and that sweet air which is \nMorn's messenger, with rose enamel'd skies, \nCalls each wight to salute the flower of bliss, \n\nIn tomb of lids then buried are mine eyes, \nForc'd by their lord, who is asham'd to find \nSuch light in sense, with such a darken'd mind."}
