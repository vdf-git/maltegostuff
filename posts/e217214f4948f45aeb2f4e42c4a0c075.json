{"subject": "Pause For A Moment And Just Pray", "text": "When I am confused and discouraged and nothing \nSeems to go right, pause for a moment and  \nSeek your advice. When I don't have the answers and I know not \nWhat to do, Pause for a moment and confide \nIn you. You taught me not to wander or to stray, but \nTo pause for a moment and just pray. We live in a world filled with anger, rage \nAnd despair; All it takes is to pause for \nA moment to pray, because you care. Thank you, dear Lord, knowing that you are \nNear, when I pause for a moment to pray, life \nIsn't so much to fear."}
