{"subject": "Here Will Be Echoes In The Mountains...", "text": "Here will be echoes in the mountains,\nThe distant landslides' rumbling boom,\nThe rocks, the dwellings in the village,\nThe sorry little inn, the gloom\n\nOf something black beyond the Terek,\nClouds moving heavily. Up there\nThe day was breaking very slowly;\nIt dawned, but light was nowhere near.\n\nOne sensed the heaviness of darkness\nFor miles ahead around Kazbek\nWound on the heights: though some were trying\nTo throw the halter from their neck.\n\nAs if cemented in an oven,\nIn the strange substance of a dream,\nA pot of poisoned food, the region\nOf Daghestan there slowly steamed.\n\nIts towering peaks towards us rolling,\nAll black from top to foot, it strained\nTo meet our car, if not with clashing\nOf daggers, then with pouring rain.\n\nThe mountains were preparing trouble.\nThe handsome giants, fierce and black,\nEach one more evil than the other\nWere closing down upon our track."}
