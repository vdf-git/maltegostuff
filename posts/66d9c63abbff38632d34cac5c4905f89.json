{"subject": "Landscape", "text": "(for a picture)\nWith all its branches a slender tree casts\nThe shine of darkness around poor crosses.\nThe earth stretches out painfully black and broad.\nA small moon slips slowly out of space.\nAnd next to it strange, unapproachable, huge\nAirplanes hover heavenward!\nSinners filled with longing look up, with belief\nAnd tear themselves out of their tombs."}
