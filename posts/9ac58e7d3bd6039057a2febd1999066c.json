{"subject": "A Picture Seen In A Dream", "text": "I saw the Goddess of the Evening pause\nBetween two mountain pillars. Tall as they\nAppeared her stature, and her outstretched hands\nLaid on those luminous cold summits, hung\nTouching, and lingered. Earth was at her feet.\nHer head inclined: then the slow weight of hair,\nIn distant hue like a waved pine--forest\nUpon a mountain, down one shoulder fell.\nShe gazed, and there were stars within her eyes;\nNot like those lights in heaven which know not what\nThey shine upon; but like far human hopes,\nThat rise beyond the end of thwarting day\nIn deep hearts, wronged with waste and toil, they rose;\nAnd while beneath her from the darkening world\nA vapour and a murmur silently\nFloated, there came into those gazing eyes,\nWhat should have been, were she a mortal, tears."}
