{"subject": "My Mother's Hands", "text": "My Mother's hands, oh, the memories of them bring a sadness to my soul! \nAged, wrinkled and worn, My Mother's hands; oh, the memories, how I love them so \nThe coolness of my Mother's hands upon my fevered brow... \nMy Mother's hands, where are they now? \nA time to be remembered; a time to be forgotten; \nThe memories as my mother's hands held me, broken. \nA time to cherish, a time to adore. \nThe memories of my Mother's hands when I came back from war. \nInjured from service in faraway lands, \nI was soothed with the touch of my Mother's hands. \nI know My Mother's hands were folded in prayer at my bed. \nI felt the Spirits touch caress my heated head. \nMy Mother's hands built her soldier, who lay like dead. \nMy Mother's hands upon my wounded head. \nTo love my God with all my heart; \nTo love my neighbor, her lesson will never depart! \nOnce fallen, I live to serve again \nIn another Force, that will have no end. \nMy Mother's hands, so used of God, I have no fear \nWill touch me again in that land so dear."}
