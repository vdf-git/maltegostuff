{"subject": "Poem", "text": "Live not with thy head showing in the clouds,\nThou art by birth the offspring of this earth,\nThe stream that passed the sluice cannot again flow back,\nNor can again return the misspent time that sped,\nConsider well the deeds of the good and bad,\nWhether in this thy profit lieth or in that"}
