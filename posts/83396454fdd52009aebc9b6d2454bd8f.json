{"subject": "Sonet 55", "text": "I enuie Neptune oft, not that his hands\nDid build that loftie Ilions stately towers,\nNor that he Emperour of the liquid pow'rs,\nDoth brooke a place amongst the immortall bands,\nBut that embracing her whom I loue best,\nAs Achilous with Alcides once,\nStill wrestling with the riuall earth he grones,\nFor earnestnes t'ouerflow her happie nest:\nThus would he barre me from her presence still,\nFor when I come afield, he fann'd my sailes,\nWith mild Zephires faire yet prosprous gailes,\nAnd like t'Vlysses gaue me wind at will:\nBut when I would returne, O what deceit,\nWith tumbling waues thou barr'st the glassie gate!"}
