{"subject": "The Tide Rock", "text": "How sleeps yon rock, whose half-day's bath is done.\nWith broad blight side beneath the broad bright sun,\nLike sea-nymph tired, on cushioned mosses sleeping.\nYet, nearer drawn, beneath her purple tresses\nFrom drooping brows we find her slowly weeping.\nSo many a wife for cruel man's caresses\nMust inly pine and pine, yet outward bear\nA gallant front to this world's gaudy glare.\nIlfracombe, 1849."}
