{"subject": "Where Love Is", "text": "By the rosy cliffs of Devon, on a green hill's crest, \nI would build me a house as a swallow builds its nest; \nI would curtain it with roses, and the wind should breathe to me \nThe sweetness of the roses and the saltness of the sea. \n\nWhere the Tuscan olives whiten in the hot blue day, \nI would hide me from the heat in a little hut of gray, \nWhile the singing of the husbandman should scale my lattice green \nFrom the golden rows of barley that the poppies blaze between. \n\nNarrow is the street, Dear, and dingy are the walls \nWherein I wait your coming as the twilight falls. \nAll day with dreams I gild the grime till at your step I start -- \nAh Love, my country in your arms -- my home upon your heart!"}
