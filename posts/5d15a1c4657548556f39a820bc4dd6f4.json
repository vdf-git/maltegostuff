{"subject": "Man", "text": "I KNOW my soul hath power to know all things, \nYet she is blind and ignorant in all: \nI know I'm one of Nature's little kings, \nYet to the least and vilest things am thrall. \n\nI know my life 's a pain and but a span; \nI know my sense is mock'd in everything; \nAnd, to conclude, I know myself a Man-- \nWhich is a proud and yet a wretched thing."}
