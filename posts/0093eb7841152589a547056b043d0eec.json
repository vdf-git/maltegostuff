{"subject": "The Love You Bring To Me", "text": "There is a love that brought two hearts together \nwith sweet strands secured endearingly, \n'til the ties, seeming at first so fragile \nhave grown strong binding me with thee. There's a love bonding two hearts with caring, \nthat the eyes of love alone can see. \nbut the love, making each day enchanting, \nis your love shining bright for me. There's a love, spun tenderly entrancing,  \netching dreams you bring beguilingly, \nyet the dreams that are the most endearing, \nare the dreams you would weave for me. There's a love bringing our hearts true meaning \nboth our hearts will share eternally, \nbut the love brimming my heart with rapture \nis the love that you bring to me."}
