{"subject": "Cloudy Day", "text": "It is windy today. A wall of wind crashes against,\nwindows clunk against, iron frames\nas wind swings past broken glass\nand seethes, like a frightened cat\nin empty spaces of the cellblock.\n\nIn the exercise yard\nwe sat huddled in our prison jackets,\non our haunches against the fence,\nand the wind carried our words\nover the fences,\nwhile the vigilant guard on the tower\nheld his cap at the sudden gust.\n\nI could see the main tower from where I sat,\nand the wind in my face\ngave me the feeling I could grasp\nthe tower like a cornstalk,\nand snap it from its roots of rock.\n\nThe wind plays it like a flute,\nthis hollow shoot of rock.\nThe brim girded with barbwire\nwith a guard sitting there also,\nlistening intently to the sounds\nas clouds cover the sun.\n\nI thought of the day I was coming to prison,\nin the back seat of a police car,\nhands and ankles chained, the policeman pointed,\n    \u201cSee that big water tank? The big\n    silver one out there, sticking up?\n    That\u2019s the prison.\u201d\n\nAnd here I am, I cannot believe it.\nSometimes it is such a dream, a dream,\nwhere I stand up in the face of the wind,\nlike now, it blows at my jacket,\nand my eyelids flick a little bit,\nwhile I stare disbelieving. . . .\n\nThe third day of spring,\nand four years later, I can tell you,\nhow a man can endure, how a man\ncan become so cruel, how he can die\nor become so cold. I can tell you this,\nI have seen it every day, every day,\nand still I am strong enough to love you,\nlove myself and feel good;\neven as the earth shakes and trembles,\nand I have not a thing to my name,\nI feel as if I have everything, everything."}
