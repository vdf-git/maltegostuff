{"subject": "Evil Influence", "text": "'Tis not the violent hands alone that bring\nThe curse, the ravage, and the downward doom,\nAlthough to these full oft the yawning tomb\nOwes deadly surfeit; but a keener sting,\nA more immortal agony will cling\nTo the half fashioned sin which would assume\nFair Virtue's garb; the eye that sows the gloom\nWith quiet seeds of Death henceforth to spring\nWhat time the sun of passion burning fierce\nBreaks through the kindly cloud of circumstance;\nThe bitter word, and the unkindly glance,\nThe crust and canker coming with the years,\nAre liker Death than arrows and the lance\nWhich through the living heart at once doth pierce."}
