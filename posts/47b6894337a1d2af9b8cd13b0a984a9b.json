{"subject": "Revelation at Cap Ferrat", "text": "It's not solely the dance\nof the juggler but his spirit:\nwith its turkey wings, perfect thighs,\nsensuous hips, large round flat eye.\nThis eye smiles like lips.\nWatch this eye\u2014\nit's not a donkey eye.\n\nIt's not solely the dancer\nwho moves like a circus animal\nas though to children's music\u2014no,\nit's the girl in the swing's rhythm,\nthe ticking of the clock at night,\nthe strut of the cock, the flight\nof the holy family to the remains.\nThe nipple that feeds\nthe infant is an eye looking\ninto his future.\n\nIt's not even the village square\nwith its musicians and happy faces\nthat makes the difference\u2014no,\nbecause if it were, weddings\nwith violins, harps, flutes\nwould have settled the question:\nno, it is the rising and lifting,\nthe failing and catching of\nthat unknown sense of self\nbefore it crashes, that matters."}
