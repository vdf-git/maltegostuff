{"subject": "The Elementary Scene", "text": "Looking back in my mind I can see \nThe white sun like a tin plate \nOver the wooden turning of the weeds; \nThe street jerking --a wet swing-- \nTo end by the wall the children sang. \n\nThe thin grass by the girls' door, \nTrodden on, straggling, yellow and rotten, \nAnd the gaunt field with its one tied cow-- \nThe dead land waking sadly to my life-- \nStir, and curl deeper in the eyes of time. \n\nThe rotting pumpkin under the stairs \nBundled with switches and the cold ashes \nStill holds for me, in its unwavering eyes, \nThe stinking shapes of cranes and witches, \nTheir path slanting down the pumpkin's sky. \n\nIts stars beckon through the frost like cottages \n(Homes of the Bear, the Hunter--of that absent star, \nThe dark where the flushed child struggles into sleep) \nTill, leaning a lifetime to the comforter, \nI float above the small limbs like their dream: \n\nI, I, the future that mends everything."}
