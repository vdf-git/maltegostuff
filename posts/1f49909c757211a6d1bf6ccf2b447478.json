{"subject": "Down From The Mountain", "text": "As down Mount Emerald at eve I came,\n       The mountain moon went all the way with me.\nBackward I looked, to see the heights aflame\n       With a pale light that glimmered eerily.\n\nA little lad undid the rustic latch\n       As hand in hand your cottage we did gain,\nWhere green limp tendrils at our cloaks did catch,\n       And dim bamboos o'erhung a shadowy lane.\n\nGaily I cried, \"Here may we rest our fill!\"\n       Then choicest wines we quaffed; and cheerily\n\"The Wind among the Pines\" we sang, until\n       A few faint stars hung in the Galaxy.\n\n       Merry were you, my friend: and drunk was I,\n       Blissfully letting all the world go by."}
