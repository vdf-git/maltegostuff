{"subject": "Spring Song Of The Swallow", "text": "Oh, the days are growing longer;\nSo rang the jubilant song of the swallow;\nI come a-bringing beauty into the land,\nThe sky of the West grows warm and yellow,\nOh, gladness comes with my light-winged band,\nAnd the days are growing longer.\n\nOh, the days are growing longer,\nThe wavy gleam of fluttering wings,\nTouching the silent earth so lightly,\nWill wake all the sleeping, beautiful things,\nThe world will glow so brightly--brightly;\nAnd the days are growing longer.\n\nOh, the days are growing longer,\nAll the rivulets dumb will laugh, and run\nOver the meadows with dancing feet;\nFollowing the silvery plough of the sun,\nWill be furrows filled with wild flowers sweet:\nAnd the days are growing longer.\n\nOh, the days are growing longer;\nOver whispering streams will rushes lean,\nTo answer the waves' soft murmurous call;\nThe lily will bend from its watch-tower green,\nTo list to the lark's low madrigal,\nAnd the days are growing longer.\n\nOh, the days are growing longer;\nWhen they lengthen to ripe and perfect prime,\nThen, oh, then, I will build my happy nest;\nAnd all in that pleasant and balmy time,\nThere never will be a bird so blest;\nAnd the days are growing longer."}
