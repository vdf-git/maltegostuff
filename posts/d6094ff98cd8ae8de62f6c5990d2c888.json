{"subject": "Selfish", "text": "I am selfish in my wishin' every sort o' joy for you;\nI am selfish when I tell you that I'm wishin' skies o' blue\nBending o'er you every minute, and a pocketful of gold,\nAn' as much of love an' gladness as a human heart can hold.\nCoz I know beyond all question that if such a thing could be\nAs you cornerin' life's riches you would share 'em all with me.\n\nI am selfish in my wishin' every sorrow from your way,\nWith no trouble thoughts to fret you at the closin' o' the day;\nAn' it's selfishness that bids me wish you comforts by the score,\nAn' all the joys you long for, an' on top o' them, some more;\nCoz I know, old tried an' faithful, that if such a thing could be\nAs you cornerin' life's riches you would share 'em all with me."}
