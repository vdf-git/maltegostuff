{"subject": "Bass Line", "text": "He needs a bigger body, bull fiddle\nto make that thump, that deeper pulse, he needs\n\nfour fat inflexible strings made of gut \nwrapped by steel so he can pluck each night\n\nthat tree and its strange fruit, its slumped shoulders, \nand bulging eyes... As he fingers the neck,\n\nas he frets, keeps the time, he can take\nthose naked feet hung like weights on a stopped clock.\n\nIf it's too much to say one sight winds up \na life and keeps it running, still\n\nsome things are burned into the eyes \nlike a maker's mark seared into walnut\n\nbelly or back, history always there, \nno matter how the body is patched\n\nand reglued, the gut and steel fine-tuned. \nIt's a deep groove in the brain,\n\nwhether you play on top or behind the beat,\nwalk the line or break out: to know a man can be\n\nwaiting for a train and because the crowd's \nriled up get taken \u2014 If death unmakes him,\n\nmaybe music's a way of weeping, \nof cradling the broken body,\n\nits strained neck, its eyes that tried to jump \nat what they saw, the sad hands, sad hands\n\nthat couldn't lift to brush a fly.\nNight after night, rhythm wants to unwind\n\nthe wire cable from that tree, sway \nthe mob away from its drunken rush.\n\nSo if he humps that stiff body night \nafter night, if he slaps and slaps? It's to\n\naccent the offbeat, strengthen the weak, swing \nlike somebody who knows, who knows what it is."}
