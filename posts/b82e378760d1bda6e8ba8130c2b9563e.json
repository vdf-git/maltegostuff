{"subject": "Elegy Ii. On Posthumous Reputation - To A Friend", "text": "O grief of griefs! that Envy's frantic ire\nShould rob the living virtue of its praise;\nO foolish Muses! that with zeal aspire\nTo deck the cold insensate shrine with bays.\n\nWhen the free spirit quits her humble frame,\nTo tread the skies with radiant garlands crown'd;\nSay, will she hear the distant voice of Fame?\nOr, hearing, fancy sweetness in the sound?\n\nPerhaps even Genius pours a slighted lay;\nPerhaps even Friendship sheds a fruitless tear;\nEven Lyttleton but vainly trims the bay,\nAnd fondly graces Hammond's mournful bier.\n\nThough weeping virgins haunt his favour'd urn,\nRenew their chaplets, and repeat their sighs;\nThough near his tomb Sab\u00c3\u00a6an odours burn,\nThe loit'ring fragrance will it reach the skies?\n\nNo; should his Delia votive wreaths prepare,\nDelia might place the votive wreaths in vain:\nYet the dear hope of Delia's future care\nOnce crown'd his pleasures, and dispell'd his pain.\n\nYes-the fair prospect of surviving praise\nCan every sense of present joys excel;\nFor this, great Hadrian chose laborious days;\nThrough this, expiring, bade a gay farewell.\n\nShall then our youths, who Fame's bright fabric raise,\nTo life's precarious date confine their care?\nO teach them you to spread the sacred base,\nTo plan a work through latest ages fair!\n\nIs it small transport, as with curious eye\nYou trace the story of each Attic sage,\nTo think your blooming praise shall time defy?\nShall waft, like odours, through the pleasing page?\n\nTo mark the day when, through the bulky tome,\nAround your name the varying style refines?\nAnd readers call their lost attention home,\nLed by that index where true genius shines?\n\nAh! let not Britons doubt their social aim,\nWhose ardent bosoms catch this ancient fire;\nCold interest melts before the vivid flame,\nAnd patriot ardours but with life expire."}
