{"subject": "The Crab Feast", "text": "I \n\nThere is no getting closer \nthan this. My tongue slips into \nthe furthest, sweetest corner \nof you. I know all \n\nnow all your secrets. \nWhen the shell \ncracked there was nothing \nbetween us. I taste moonlight \n\ntransformed into flesh \nand the gas bubbles rising \noff sewage. I go down \nunder the mangrove roots and berries, under the moon's \n\nashes; it is cool \ndown there. I always knew that there was more \nto the Bay than its glitters, \nknew if you existed \n\nI could also \nenter it; I'd caught so deeply all \nyour habits, knowing the ways \nwe differ I'd come to think we must be one. \n\nI took you \nto me. Prepared \na new habitat under the coral \nreef of my ribs. You hang there, broken like the sun. \n\nII \n\nNoon that blinding glass did not reveal us \nas we were. It cast us variant selves \nmore real than \nreflections, forms \n\nwith a life of their own, \nstalk eye a periscope \nthat determined horizons, Doulton claws \nthat could snap of a thumb. \n\nI liked that. Hence the deep afternoons \nwith pole and net, the deeper \nnights when I went down after the tropic \nsun. Hence too the Latin \n\nnames, a dangerous clawhold. I wanted the whole of you, raw \npoundage \nin defiance of breathlessness \nor the power of verbal charms, \non my palm, on my tongue. \n\nIII \nThis the Place. I come back \nnightly to find it \n- still, sleepy, sunlit, presided over \n\nby old-timers, waterbirds whose one \nthin leg props up clouds, \nthe ruck of open water \n\nahead, and the hours \nof deepening blue on blue the land wades into afternoon. \nThese then the perspectives: \nmatchwood pier, a brackish estuary \nthat flows on into \nthe sun, a rip of light over the dunes. \n\nI enter. It is all \naround me, the wash \nof air, clear-spirit country. It goes on \n\nall day like this. The tide \nhovers and withdraws. Under the sun, under the moon's \ncross-currents, shadows \n\nfall into place \nand are gathered to the dark. This hunt \nis ritual, all the parties to it lost. Even the breaths \n\nwe draw between cries \nare fixed terms in what is celebrated, \nthe spaces in a net. \n\nAmong mangrove trunks the fire \n-flies like small hot love-crazed \nplanets switch on, \n\nswitch off. They too \nhave caught something. A chunk of solid midnight \nthrashes in the star-knots of their mesh. \n\nIV \nYou scared me with your stillness and I scared \nmyself. Knowing \nthat everything, even the footsoles of the dead, where your small \nmouths \nnudged them, would feed \n\nthe airy process of it. \nThe back of my head \nwas open to the dream \ndark your body moves in. I hunted you \n\nlike a favourite colour, \nindigo, to learn \nhow changeable we are, what rainbows \nwe harbour with us \n\nand how I should die, cast wheezing into \na cauldron of fog. \nThat was the plan: \nto push on through \n\nthe spectrum to that perfect \nprimary death colour, out \ninto silence and a landscape \nof endings, with the brute sky pumping red. \n\nV. \nI watch at a distance \nof centuries, in the morning \nlight of another planet \nor the earliest gloom \n\nof this one, your backward \nsubmarine retreat, \nas hovering across \nthe seabed \u2014 courtly, \n\nelate, iron-plated \u2014 \nyou practice the Dance. \nI watch and am shut out. \nThe terrible privacies! \n\nYou move slow motion sideways, \nan unsteady astronaut: \nstep and counter \nstep, then the clash, \n\nsoundless, of tank engagement; \nyou might be angels \nin the only condition \nour senses reach them in. I observe \n\nyour weightless, clumsy-tender \nrelease. I observe \nthe rules; cut off \nhere in the dimension \n\nof pure humanity, my need for air \na limiting factor, \nI look through into \nyour life. Its mysteries \n\ndisarm me. Turning \naway a second time \nto earth, to air, I leave you \nto your slow-fangled order, \n\ntaking with me \nmore than I came for \nand less. You move back into \nmy head. No, it does not finish here. \n\nVI \nWe were horizons \nof each other's consciousness. All transactions \nat this distance are small \nblurred, uninsistent. Drawn \n\nby unlikeness, I grew \nlike you, or dreamed I did, sharing your cautious \nsideways grip on things, not to be broken, \nyour smokiness of blood, as kin \n\nto dragons we guarded \nin the gloom of mangrove trunks \nour hoard. I crossed the limits \ninto alien territory. One of us \n\nwill die of this, I told myself; and one of us \ndid. The other \nswam off to lick warm stones and sulk with clouds along a \nshoreline, \nregretting the deep \n\nshelves and downward spaces, \nbreathing easy, \nbut knowing something more \nwas owed and would take place. I go down \n\nin the dark to that encounter, the sun \nat my back. On the sea-bed \nyour eyes on their sticks \nclick white in the flattened shadow of my head. \n\nVII \n\nA dreamy phosphorescence \npaddles towards me. The moon drowses, \nfeeds, its belly white, its tough shell \nblack. We are afloat \n\ntogether. You are \nmy counterweight there, I hand above you \nin sunlight and a balance \nis struck. No, the end \n\nwill not be like this. \nWe belong to different orders, and are trapped \nby what we chose. Our kinship \nis metaphorical, but no less deadly for all that, \n\nold Dreadnought; as if I wore \nblack and carried death clenched in my fist. I do \nwear black. My hand is open. It is my teeth \nthat seek you in the dark. And I approach bearing a death. \n\nVIII \n\nIt was always like this: you \nbroken before me, \nbeautiful in all \nthe order of your parts, an anatomy lesson, \n\nthe simple continent \nour bodies broke away from. \nBecause you are so open, because \nthe whole of your life \n\nis laid out here, a chamber \nto be entered and stripped. You have nothing \nto hide. That sort of power \nkills us, for whom \n\nmoonlight, the concept blue, \nis intolerably complex as \nour cells are, each an open universe \nexpanding beyond us, the tug \n\nof immortality. \nWe shall reach it and still die. \nI will be \nbroken after you, that was the bargain \n\nall this \na compact between us, who love \nour privacies. I play \nmy part. Bent over you I dip my hand \n\nin the bowl, I shake my cuffs, out in the open \nand lost. Deep down \nI am with you in the dark. The secret flesh of \nmy tongue enters a claw. \n\nBecause you are so open. Because you are. \n\nIX \n\nIt is your weight \nthat hangs upon me. How \nto deal with it. Hooded, claws locked \nto your body like a star \n\nyou drag me under \nthe light of this occasion \nto others. I've dreamed you once \ntoo often. So this \n\nis what it is to drown, this suffocating \ntorpor, giving up to \nthe drug of, the drag of \nthe moon. Here in your kingdom \n\nI feel night harden over \nmy skull. That we should have come \nso far out of the dark \ntogether. I try to drown \n\nwell, I hold my breath, \nno thrashing. Blue, majestic, \nyou blaze in my thoughts. Displacing more \nthan your real weight, making less \n\nthan the usual disturbance, \nyou plunge and take me with you. \nI go out \nin silence, in full view \n\nof waiters; having learned \nthis much at least; to die true \nto my kind \u2014 upright, smiling \u2014 \nand like, beyond speech. \n\nX \n\nNo I am not ashamed \nof our likeness, of what is in it that betrays me, \na smell of salt \n\nbackwaters, a native \ngrasp of the gist \nof things, our local patch \n\nof not-quite-solid earth from which the vast swing of the sky \nis trackable. Night \ncomes on and I am caught \n\nwith a whole life in my hands, \nin my mouth raw words, \nthe taste of so much air, so much water, \n\nflesh. It was never to be weighed, \nthis dull shore and its landscape, water \npoised above water \n\nand all its swarming creatures, against the kingdom of cloud castles \nwe build with our breath. \nBut words made you \n\na fact in my head. You were \nmyself in another species, brute \nblue, a bolt of lightning, maybe God. \n\nNow all has been made plain \nbetween us, the weights are equal, though the sky \ntilts, and the sun \n\nwith a splash I do no hear breaks into \nthe dark. We are one at last. Assembled here \nout of earth, water, air \n\nto a love feast. You lie open \nbefore me. I am ready. \nBegin."}
