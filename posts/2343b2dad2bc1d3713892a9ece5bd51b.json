{"subject": "To A Painter: Drawing Her Picture.", "text": "Let All that's charming, All that's good, appear\nIn ev'ry Touch:--Thou can'st not flatter here.\nWith trembling Awe trace out each beauteous Line,\nConsider: She Thou pictur'st is divine.\nObserve each Feature, mark each blooming Grace,\nAnd all the Heav'n which opens in her Face;\nThen stop thy Hand at the surprizing View,\nNor madly dare beyond what Art can do."}
