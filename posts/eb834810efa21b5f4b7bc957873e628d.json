{"subject": "Telling Tales Out Of School", "text": "There was a famous Hollywood designer  \nKnown worldwide for her movie gowns;  \nWho was asked by a talk show host,  \n\"Why so successful in Tinsel Town?\"  She was thoughtful for a moment;  \nThen to everyone\u2019s great surprise,  \n\"I was a high school teacher\",  \nShe replied with a twinkle in her eyes.  \"What kind of answer is that?\" She was asked.  \nThen she replied with a knowing smile,  \n\"Once you have taught in high school,  \nYou can do anything that is worthwhile.\"  She had discovered what all good teachers know;  \nThat with creativity, vision, and plans that are sound,  \nEven the most reluctant scholar can be reached;  \nJust as a piece of cloth can become a ball gown.  No wonder the designer replied as she did.  \nWhat awesome responsibilities teachers have.  \nWith little recognition and meager pay,  \nOnly those who CAN-teach."}
