{"subject": "For The Album Of Miss E. L. B--", "text": "Is there, in all the skies, a star\nThat envies not the Queen of Heaven,\nAs nightly, on her silver car,\nThrough their retiring ranks she's driven?\nThere is:-for, though a countless train,\nThat sparkled ere she rose to view,\nGrow pale with envy when the plain\nIs sprinkled with her light and dew,\nOne stands unmoved, and sees her roll,\nNor will retire, nor yet attend her;\n'T is she whose lamp illumes the pole\nWith modest but eternal splendor.\nSprings there a plant or flower to light,\nWhose bosom, all unknown to guile,\nIs bathed in the pure tears of Night,\nAnd dried in Morning's cheerful smile,-\nWhether that plant or blossom throws\nIts fragrance over hill or dale,-\nThat envies not to see the Rose\nUnfold her leaves and woo the gale,\nWhen on her green and graceful stem\nShe hangs, her native bush adorning,\nSparkling with many a dewy gem,\nAnd blushing with the beams of morning?\nYes, there is one, and one alone;-\nMimosa, pride of vegetation,\nBoasts higher honors of her own;\nHers is the honor of sensation.\nAnd is there one whose peace the glare\nOf others' beauty never mars?\nOne of the blooming, sparkling fair,\nWhose emblems are the flowers and stars?\nYes:-there is one; 't is she who shrinks\nFrom even admiration's gaze,\nWho courts the shade, who feels, who thinks,\nAnd spreads her hands to heaven in praise;\n'T is she whose spirit dwells on high,\nEven in the thoughtful nights of youth;\n'T is she whose mild and constant eye\nBeams with the faithful light of truth.\nHeaven's brilliant lights, Earth's blooming flowers,-\nThese shall all fade, and those shall fall:-\nThe moral beauty that is ours\nShall flourish o'er the tomb of all."}
