{"subject": "The Hartley Colliery Catastrophe", "text": "Dark gulf of death! black cavern of despair!\nFrom your foul depths, to breathe the upper air,\nNo victim comes-one common living grave\nEncloses all-no human aid can save!\nNot one-not one-to tell the fearful tale\nHow hope expired, and life began to fail;\nHow poisonous gases drank the fainting breath-\nThe scene around one sweltering mass of death-\nAnd was there nought but darkness, death, despair,\nIn that low dungeon? Hark! the voice of prayer,\nThe solemn agony of wrestling faith,\nPassing to life through the dark gates of death,\nAnd forms celestial, 'mid the gloom profound,\nBright messengers of heaven are hovering round,\nTo waft the ransomed spirits as they rise,\nOn their swift pinions to the upper skies.\nBroad Britain's heart is moved, its troubled deeps\nAre full of grief and horror while she weeps\nHer perished ones-those pale and ghastly sleepers-\nShe spurns the plea-are we our brother's keepers?\n'Thy brother's blood cries to me from the ground:'\nAn awful truth-stern, solemn, and profound,\nBy Heaven proclaimed-the loss so deep lamented,\nBy obvious means, could-should-have been prevented.\nCould tender sympathy and generous deeds\nBind up each stricken heart that inly bleeds\nIn widowed bosoms-still the orphans' cries-\nThese generous pity prompt, and kind supplies?\nAh! these are wounds which only God can heal;\nThe strength He gives shall never faint nor fail;\nYour orphans' wrongs and yours He will redress-\nThe widows' Judge is He in holiness."}
