{"subject": "The Christian", "text": "Honor and happiness unite \nTo make the Christian's name a praise; \nHow fair the scene, how clear the light, \nThat fills the remnant of His days! \n\nA kingly character He bears, \nNo change His priestly office knows; \nUnfading is the crown He wears, \nHis joys can never reach a close. \n\nAdorn'd with glory from on high, \nSalvation shines upon His face; \nHis robe is of the ethereal dye, \nHis steps are dignity and grace. \n\nInferior honors He disdains, \nNor stoops to take applause from earth; \nThe King of kings Himself maintains \nThe expenses of His heavenly birth. \n\nThe noblest creature seen below, \nOrdain'd to fill a throne above; \nGod gives him all He can bestow, \nHis kingdom of eternal love! \n\nMy soul is ravished at the thought! \nMethinks from earth I see Him rise! \nAngels congratulate His lot, \nAnd shout Him welcome to the skies."}
