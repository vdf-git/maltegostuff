{"subject": "Nobody Cometh To Woo", "text": "On Martinmas eve the dogs did bark,\nAnd I opened the window to see,\nWhen every maiden went by with her spark\nBut neer a one came to me.\nAnd O dear what will become of me?\nAnd O dear what shall I do,\nWhen nobody whispers to marry me--\nNobody cometh to woo?\n\nNone's born for such troubles as I be:\nIf the sun wakens first in the morn\n'Lazy hussy' my parents both call me,\nAnd I must abide by their scorn,\nFor nobody cometh to marry me,\nNobody cometh to woo,\nSo here in distress must I tarry me--\nWhat can a poor maiden do?\n\nIf I sigh through the window when Jerry\nThe ploughman goes by, I grow bold;\nAnd if I'm disposed to be merry,\nMy parents do nothing but scold;\nAnd Jerry the clown, and no other,\nEer cometh to marry or woo;\nThey think me the moral of mother\nAnd judge me a terrible shrew.\n\nFor mother she hateth all fellows,\nAnd spinning's my father's desire,\nWhile the old cat growls bass with the bellows\nIf eer I hitch up to the fire.\nI make the whole house out of humour,\nI wish nothing else but to please,\nWould fortune but bring a new comer\nTo marry, and make me at ease!\n\nWhen I've nothing my leisure to hinder\nI scarce get as far as the eaves;\nHer head's instant out of the window\nCalling out like a press after thieves.\nThe young men all fall to remarking,\nAnd laugh till they're weary to see't,\nWhile the dogs at the noise begin barking,\nAnd I slink in with shame from the street.\n\nMy mother's aye jealous of loving,\nMy father's aye jealous of play,\nSo what with them both there's no moving,\nI'm in durance for life and a day.\nO who shall I get for to marry me?\nWho will have pity to woo?\nTis death any longer to tarry me,\nAnd what shall a poor maiden do?"}
