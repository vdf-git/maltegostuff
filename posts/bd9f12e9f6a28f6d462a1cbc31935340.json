{"subject": "In Memoriam Susan Eugenia Bennett", "text": "When the Sabbath was declining, just at twilight's\nmystic hour,\nLeft the 'Upper Courts' an angel, sent to cull our\nsweetest flower,\nNot in judgment, not in anger, did this white-winged\nseraph come,\nBut to lead a little Pilgrim through Death's Portal to\nher home.\n\nAnd our angel child was ready, aye, and anxious to\ndepart-\nNot the slightest doubt o'ershadowed her trusting\nlittle heart;\nBut with a brow as radiant as rainbow in the sky,\nShe whispered softly 'Mother, I'm not afraid to die.'\n\nWhen shall these little, weary limbs lie down to sweet\nrepose,\n'Mid the green, the verdant pastures where the limpid\nwater flows;\nWhen shall I the Golden City sparkling in its beauty\nsee,\n'When shall it be, my Saviour, O! when shall I be\nfree?'\nEre the week-day with its labors, its duties and its\ncare-\nWas shared in, our darling was found on earth no\nwhere;\nBut with the saints in glory, and the Saviour she\nadored,\nShe's happy and at rest, for aye and ever with the\nLord."}
