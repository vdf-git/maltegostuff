{"subject": "A Sonnet", "text": "WEEPING, murmuring, complaining,\nLost to every gay delight;\nMYRA, too sincere for feigning,\nFears th' approaching bridal night.\n\nYet, why impair thy bright perfection? \nOr dim thy beauty with a tear?\nHad MYRA followed my direction,\nShe long had wanted cause of fear."}
