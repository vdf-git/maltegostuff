{"subject": "Oh! Weep For Those", "text": "I.\nOh! Weep for those that wept by Babel's stream, \nWhose shrines are desolate, whose land a dream, \nWeep for the harp of Judah's broken shell--\nMourn--where their God that dwelt-the Godless dwell! \n\nII.\nAnd where shall Israel lave her bleeding feet? \nAnd when shall Zion's songs agains seem sweet? \nAnd Judah's melody once more rejoice \nThe hearts that leap'd before its heavenly voice? \n\nIII.\nTribes of the wandering foot and weary breast! \nHow shall ye flee away and be at rest! \nThe wild-dove hath her nest--the fox his cave-- \nMankind their Country--Israel but the grave."}
