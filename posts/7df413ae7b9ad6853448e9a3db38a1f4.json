{"subject": "On A Sea Wall", "text": "I sit upon the old sea wall,\nAnd watch the shimmering sea,\nWhere soft and white the moonbeams fall,\nTill, in a fantasy,\nSome pure white maiden's funeral pall\nThe strange light seems to me.\n\nThe waters break upon the shore\nAnd shiver at my feet,\nWhile I dream old dreams o'er and o'er,\nAnd dim old scenes repeat;\nTho' all have dreamed the same before,\nThey still seem new and sweet.\n\nThe waves still sing the same old song\nThat knew an elder time;\nThe breakers' beat is not more strong,\nTheir music more sublime;\nAnd poets thro' the ages long\nHave set these notes to rhyme.\n\nBut this shall not deter my lyre,\nNor check my simple strain;\nIf I have not the old-time fire,\nI know the ancient pain:\nThe hurt of unfulfilled desire,--\nThe ember quenched by rain.\n\nI know the softly shining sea\nThat rolls this gentle swell\nHas snarled and licked its tongues at me\nAnd bared its fangs as well;\nThat 'neath its smile so heavenly,\nThere lurks the scowl of hell!\n\nBut what of that? I strike my string\n(For songs in youth are sweet);\nI 'll wait and hear the waters bring\nTheir loud resounding beat;\nThen, in her own bold numbers sing\nThe Ocean's dear deceit!"}
