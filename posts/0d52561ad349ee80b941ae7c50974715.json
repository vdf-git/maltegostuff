{"subject": "To Earthward", "text": "Love at the lips was touch \nAs sweet as I could bear; \nAnd once that seemed too much; \nI lived on air \n\nThat crossed me from sweet things, \nThe flow of - was it musk \nFrom hidden grapevine springs \nDown hill at dusk? \n\nI had the swirl and ache \nFrom sprays of honeysuckle \nThat when they're gathered shake \nDew on the knuckle. \n\nI craved strong sweets, but those \nSeemed strong when I was young; \nThe petal of the rose \nIt was that stung. \n\nNow no joy but lacks salt \nThat is not dashed with pain \nAnd weariness and fault; \nI crave the stain \n\nOf tears, the aftermark \nOf almost too much love, \nThe sweet of bitter bark \nAnd burning clove. \n\nWhen stiff and sore and scarred \nI take away my hand \nFrom leaning on it hard \nIn grass and sand, \n\nThe hurt is not enough: \nI long for weight and strength \nTo feel the earth as rough \nTo all my length."}
