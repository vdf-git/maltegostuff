{"subject": "The Watch On The Kerb", "text": "Night-Lights are falling;\nGirl of the street,\nGo to your calling\nIf you would eat.\nLamplight and starlight\nAnd moonlight superb,\nBright hope is a farlight,\nSo watch on the kerb. \nWatch on the kerb,\nWatch on the kerb;\nHope is a farlight;\nThen watch on the kerb. \n\nComes a man: call him \u2014\nGone! he is vext;\nCurses befall him,\nWait for the next!\nFair world and bright world,\nLife still is sweet \u2014\nGirl of the night-world,\nWatch on the street. \n\nDreary the watch is:\nMoon sinks from sight,\nGas only blotches\nDarkness with light;\nNever, Oh, never\nLet courage go down;\nKeep from the river,\nOh, Girl of the Town!"}
