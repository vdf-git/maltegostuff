{"subject": "Wellness, A Mind Thing", "text": "Old men sit on benches, nodding in the sun\n Ladies past their prime, dream of things they wished they'd done\n While children turn to caregivers for guidance and trust\n But wellness,\n Like the good, the love, the God that is in everyone\n Has it's genesis, it's alpha and omega,\n In the mind of all of us.\n  Maturation If I falter, Correct me; I need your strength.\n If I am sluggish, Push me; I need your encouragement.\n If I am idle, Give me choices; I need to learn to set priorities.\n If I criticize, Be gentle; I need your understanding.\n If I am aimless, Change your footsteps; I need your example\n If I am listless, Present me with a challenge; I need to accept responsiblity.\n If I am bitter, Be tolerate; I need your patience.\n If I stumble, Have faith; I must learn to do for myself\n If I have misbehaved, Discipline me; I need to know that you are consistent\n If I am worthy, Praise me; I need your acceptance and approval.\n If I do deeds of accomplishment, Be fair; I need to know that justice exists.\n For I am the result of your creativity I am your shadow\n Your hue; I am your future, The sum of your experimentations;\n I am the birth of your destiny\n I am you."}
