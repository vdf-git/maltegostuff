{"subject": "On My First Son", "text": "Farewell, thou child of my right hand, and joy;\n My sin was too much hope of thee, lov'd boy.\nSeven years thou'wert lent to me, and I thee pay,\n Exacted by thy fate, on the just day.\nO, could I lose all father now! For why\n Will man lament the state he should envy?\nTo have so soon 'scap'd world's and flesh's rage,\n And, if no other misery, yet age?\nRest in soft peace, and, ask'd, say here doth lie\n Ben Jonson his best piece of poetry.\nFor whose sake, henceforth, all his vows be such,\n As what he loves may never like too much."}
