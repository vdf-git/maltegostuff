{"subject": "An Honest Man", "text": "'Tis hard to find an honest man,\nSincere in every part,\nAnd who, could you his motives scan,\nIs truthful in his heart;\nFor, tho' to others he be just\nIn dealing with their pelf,\nSay is he faithful to his trust\nAnd honest to himself?\n\nThe miser and the prodigal\nAre both dishonest men,\nAnd are as deaf to reason's call\nAs is my writing pen;\nThis, gathers all the wealth he can,\nThat, spends without control,\nAnd neither is an honest man,\nFor each defrauds his soul.\n\nThe votaries of fashion are\nTo modest virtues blind;\nAnd all their vanities declare\nTheir littleness of mind.\nTho' like the peacock's gaudy tail\nTheir fashion-dress may seem,\nYet after all, they often fail\nTo win the world's esteem.\n\nTho' dandies think themselves so nice,\nIn spite of all their skill,\nA man may estimate their price\nWho knows their tailor's bill;\nWhat! honest! no, we don't believe,\nAnd never did, nor can,\nFor he who dresses to deceive\nIs not an honest man.\n\nThe drunkard acts dishonestly\nTo friends, and home, and wife,\nHis prospects and posterity,\nHis character and life;\nHe, thro' his craving thirst for drink,\nHas lost all self-control,\nAnd rushes down to ruin's brink\nWith guilt upon his soul.\n\nBut tho' your character be fair,\nUnstained by outward sin,\nYet search your heart, and oh! beware\nOf lurking thieves within;\nFor tho' you pay your lawful debt,\nAnd have an honest name,\nStill you may wilfully forget\nTo meet God's higher claim.\n\nIf rich don't toss your head too high,\nNor claim the whole amount,\nFor God will call you by and by\nTo render your account;\nThen how can you be reckoned just,\nWho claim what God has given,\nAnd faithless to your sacred trust\nDefraud the God of heaven?\n\nThus he is honest, he alone,\nWho gives what God bestows- \nWhose words and deeds are wisely shown\nTo lessen human woes;\nThen if you love an honest name\nYou'll follow heaven's plan- \nThe lowly road to highest fame- \nA truthful, honest man."}
