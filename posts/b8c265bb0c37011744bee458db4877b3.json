{"subject": "The Great Seducer", "text": "Who looks too long from his window\nAt the gray, wide, cold sea,\nWhere breakers scour the beaches\nWith fingers of sharp foam;\nWho looks too long thro the gray pane\nAt the mad, wild, bold sea,\nShall sell his hearth to a stranger\nAnd turn his back on home.\n\nWho looks too long from his window-\nTho his wife waits by the fireside-\nAt a ship's wings in the offing,\nAt a gull's wings on air,\nShall latch his gate behind him,\nThough his cattle call from the byre-side,\nAnd kiss his wife-and leave her-\nAnd wander everywhere.\n\nWho looks too long in the twilight,\nOr the dawn-light, or the noon-light,\nWho sees an anchor lifted\nAnd hungers past content,\nShall pack his chest for the world's end,\nFor alien sun-or moonlight,\nAnd follow the wind, sateless,\nTo disillusionment!"}
