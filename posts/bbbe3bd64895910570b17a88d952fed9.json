{"subject": "I Know I Am But Summer To Your Heart", "text": "I know I am but summer to your heart,\nAnd not the full four seasons of the year;\nAnd you must welcome from another part\nSuch noble moods as are not mine, my dear.\nNo gracious weight of golden fruits to sell\nHave I, nor any wise and wintry thing;\nAnd I have loved you all too long and well\nTo carry still the high sweet breast of Spring.\nWherefore I say: O love, as summer goes,\nI must be gone, steal forth with silent drums,\nThat you may hail anew the bird and rose\nWhen I come back to you, as summer comes.\nElse will you seek, at some not distant time,\nEven your summer in another clime."}
