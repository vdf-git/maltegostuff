{"subject": "The Trip To The Mental Hospital", "text": "Fat trains go down loud tracks\nPast houses, which are like coffins.\nOn the corners wheelbarrows with bananas squat.\nJust a bit of shit makes a tough kid happy.\nThe human beasts glide along, completely lost\nAs though on a street, miserably gray and shrill.\nWorkers stream from dilapidated gates.\nA weary person moves quietly in a round tower.\nA hearse crawls along the street, two steeds out front,\nSoft as a worm and weak.\nAnd over all lies an old rag--\nThe sky... pagan and meaningless."}
