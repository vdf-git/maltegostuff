{"subject": "The Ancient Banner", "text": "In boundless mercy, the Redeemer left,\nThe bosom of his Father, and assumed\nA servant's form, though he had reigned a king,\nIn realms of glory, ere the worlds were made,\nOr the creating words, 'Let there be light'\nIn heaven were uttered. But though veiled in flesh,\nHis Deity and his Omnipotence,\nWere manifest in miracles. Disease\nFled at his bidding, and the buried dead\nRose from the sepulchre, reanimate,\nAt his command, or, on the passing bier\nSat upright, when he touched it. But he came,\nNot for this only, but to introduce\nA glorious dispensation, in the place\nOf types and shadows of the Jewish code.\nUpon the mount, and round Jerusalem,\nHe taught a purer, and a holier law,\u2014\nHis everlasting Gospel, which is yet\nTo fill the earth with gladness; for all climes\nShall feel its influence, and shall own its power.\nHe came to suffer, as a sacrifice\nAcceptable to God. The sins of all\nWere laid upon Him, when in agony\nHe bowed upon the cross. The temple's veil\nWas rent asunder, and the mighty rocks,\nTrembled, as the incarnate Deity,\nBy his atoning blood, opened that door,\nThrough which the soul, can have communion with\nIts great Creator; and when purified,\nFrom all defilements, find acceptance too,\nWhere it can finally partake of all\nThe joys of His salvation.\nBut the pure Church he planted,\u2014the pure Church\nWhich his apostles watered,\u2014and for which,\nThe blood of countless martyrs freely flowed,\nIn Roman Amphitheatres,\u2014on racks,\u2014\nAnd in the dungeon's gloom,\u2014this blessed Church,\nWhich grew in suffering, when it overspread\nSurrounding nations, lost its purity.\nIts truth was hidden, and its light obscured\nBy gross corruption, and idolatry.\nAs things of worship, it had images,\nAnd even painted canvas was adored.\nIt had a head and bishop, but this head\nWas not the Saviour, but the Pope of Rome.\nReligion was a traffic. Men defiled,\nProfessed to pardon sin, and even sell,\nThe joys of heaven for money,\u2014and to raise\nSouls out of darkness to eternal light,\nFor paltry silver lavished upon them.\nAnd thus thick darkness, overspread the Church\nAs with a mantle.\nAt length the midnight of apostacy\nPassed by, and in the horizon appeared,\nDay dawning upon Christendom. The light,\nGrew stronger, as the Reformation spread.\nFor Luther, and Melancthon, could not be\nSilenced by papal bulls, nor by decrees\nOf excommunication thundered forth\nOut of the Vatican. And yet the light,\nOf Luther's reformation, never reached\nBeyond the morning's dawn. The noontide blaze\nOf Truth's unclouded day, he never saw.\nYet after him, its rising sun displayed\nMore and more light upon the horizon.\nThough thus enlightened, the professing Church,\nWas far from many of the precious truths\nOf the Redeemer's gospel; and as yet,\nOwned not his Spirit's government therein.\nBut now the time approached, when he would pour\nA larger measure of his light below;\nAnd as he chose unlearned fishermen\nTo spread his gospel when first introduced,\nSo now he passed mere human learning by,\nAnd chose an instrument, comparable\nTo the small stone the youthful David used,\nTo smite the champion who defied the Lord.\nApart from human dwellings, in a green\nRich pasturage of England, sat a youth,\nWho seemed a shepherd, for around him there\nA flock was feeding, and the sportive lambs\nGambolled amid the herbage. But his face\nBore evidence of sadness. On his knee\nThe sacred book lay open, upon which\nThe youth looked long and earnestly, and then,\nClosing the book, gazed upward, in deep thought\nThis was the instrument by whom the Lord\nDesigned to spread a clearer light below\nAnd fuller reformation. He appeared,\nLike ancient Samuel, to be set apart\nFor the Lord's service from his very birth.\nEven in early childhood, he refrained\nFrom youthful follies, and his mind was turned\nTo things of highest moment. He was filled\nWith awful feelings, by the wickedness\nHe saw around him. As he grew in years,\nHorror of sin grew stronger; and his mind\nBecame so clothed with sadness, and so full\nOf soul-felt longings, for the healing streams\nOf heavenly consolation, that he left\nHis earthly kindred, seeking quietude\nIn solitary places, where he read\nThe book of inspiration, and in prayer,\nSought heavenly counsel.\nIn this deep-proving season he was told,\nOf priests, whose reputation had spread wide\nFor sanctity and wisdom; and from these\nHe sought for consolation,\u2014but in vain.\nOne of these ministers became enraged,\nBecause the youth had inadvertently\nMisstepped within his garden; and a priest\nOf greater reputation, counselled him\nTo use tobacco, and sing holy psalms!\nAnd the inquirer found a third to be\nBut as an empty, hollow cask at best.\nFinding no help in man, the youthful Fox,\nTurned to a higher and a holier source,\nFor light and knowledge. In his Saviour's school,\nHe sat a scholar, and was clearly shown\nThe deep corruption, that had overspread\nProfessing Christendom. And one by one,\nThe doctrines of the Gospel, were unveiled,\nTo the attentive student,\u2014doctrines, which,\nThough clearly written on the sacred page,\nHad long been hidden, by the rubbish man's\nPerversions and inventions heaped thereon.\nHe saw that colleges, could not confer,\nA saving knowledge of the way of Truth,\nNor qualify a minister to preach\nThe everlasting Gospel; but that Christ,\nIs the true Teacher, and that he alone\nHas power to call, anoint, and qualify,\nAnd send a Gospel minister to preach\nGlad tidings of salvation. He was shown,\nNo outward building, made of wood and stone\nCould be a holy place,\u2014and that the Church\u2014\nThe only true and living Church\u2014must be\nA holy people gathered to the Lord,\nAnd to his teaching. He was clearly taught,\nThe nature of baptism, by which souls\nAre purified and fitted for this Church;\nThat this was not, by being dipped into,\nOr sprinkled with clear water, but it was\nThe one baptism of the Holy Ghost.\nHe saw the Supper was no outward food,\nMade and administered by human hands,\u2014\nBut the Lord's Table was within the heart;\nWhere in communion with him, holy bread\nWas blessed and broken, and the heavenly wine,\nWhich cheers the fainting spirit, handed forth.\nThe Saviour showed him that all outward wars,\nAre now forbidden,\u2014that the warfare here,\nIs to be waged within. Its weapons too,\nThough mighty, even to the pulling down,\nOf the strong holds of Satan, are yet all\nThe Spirit's weapons. He was shown, that oaths\nJudicial or profane, are banished from\nThe Christian dispensation, which commands,\n'Swear not at all.' He saw the compliments,\u2014\nHat honour, and lip service of the world,\nSprang from pride's evil root, and were opposed\nTo the pure spirit of Christ's holy law.\nAnd by His inward Light, was clearly seen\nThe perfect purity of heart and life\nFor which that Saviour calls, who never asked,\nThings unattainable.\nThese truths and others, being thus revealed,\nFox was prepared and qualified to preach,\nThe unveiled Gospel, to the sons of men.\nClothed with divine authority, he went\nAbroad through Britain, and proclaimed that Light,\nWhich Christ's illuminating Spirit sheds,\nIn the dark heart of man. Some heard of this,\nWho seemed prepared and waiting, to receive\nHis Gospel message, and were turned to Him,\nWhose Holy Spirit sealed it on their hearts.\nAnd not a few of these, were called upon,\nTo take the message, and themselves declare\nThe way of Truth to others. But the Priests,\nCarnal professors, and some magistrates,\nHeard of the inward light, and purity,\nWith indignation, and they seized upon,\nAnd thrust the Preacher within prison walls.\nNot once alone, but often was he found,\nAmid the very dregs of wickedness\u2014\nWith robbers, and with blood-stained criminals,\nLocked up in loathsome jails. And when abroad\nUpon his Master's service, he was still\nReviled and buffeted, and spit upon.\nBut none of these things moved him, for within\nHe felt that soul-sustaining evidence,\nWhich bore his spirit high above the waves,\nOf bitter persecution.\nBut now the time approached, for his release\nFrom suffering and from labour. He had spent,\nLong years in travel for the cause of Truth,\u2014\nNot all in Britain,\u2014for he preached its light,\nAnd power in Holland,\u2014the West Indian isles,\nAnd North America. Far through the wild,\nAnd trackless wilderness, this faithful man,\nCarried his Master's message; he lived,\nTo see Truth's banner fearlessly displayed\nUpon both continents. He lived to see,\nPure hearted men and women gathered to\nThe inward teaching of the Saviour's will,\u2014\nBanded together in the covenant,\nOf light and life. But his allotted work,\nWas now accomplished, and his soul prepared,\nFor an inheritance with saints in light,\nAnd with his loins all girded, he put off\nHis earthly shackles, triumphing in death,\nThat the Seed reigned, and Truth was over all!\nWhere the dark waters of the Delaware,\nRoll onward to the ocean, sweeping by,\nPrimeval forests, where the red man still,\nBuilt his rude wigwam, and the timid deer\nFled for concealment from the Indian's eye,\nAnd the unerring arrow of his bow;\nThere, in the shadow of these ancient woods,\nA sea-worn ship has anchored. On her deck,\nMen of grave mien are gathered. One of whom,\nOf noble figure, and quick searching eyes,\nSurveys the scene, wrapt in the deepest thought.\nAnd this is William Penn. He stands among,\nFellow believers, who have sought a home,\nAnd place of refuge, in this wilderness.\nBorn of an ancient family, his sire\nAn English Admiral, the youthful Penn,\nMight, with his talents, have soon ranked among\nThe proudest subjects of the British throne.\nHe chose the better part\u2014to serve that King\nWho is immortal and invisible.\nWhile yet a student within college halls,\nHe heard Truth's message, and his heart was reached,\nAnd fully owned it, though it came through one\nOf that despised and persecuted class,\nCalled in derision Quakers. Thus convinced,\nHe left the college worship, to commune\nIn spirit with his Maker. And for this,\nHe was expelled from Oxford; and was soon\nMaltreated by his father, who, enraged,\nBecause his only son, had turned away\nFrom brilliant prospects, to pursue the path\nOf self-denial, drove him harshly forth\nFrom the paternal roof. But William Penn,\nHad still a Father, who supported him,\nWith strength and courage to perform his will;\nAnd he was called and qualified to preach,\nAnd to bear witness of that blessed Light\nWhich shines within. He suffered in the cause,\nHis share of trial. He was dragged before\nJudges and juries, and was shut within\nThe walls of prisons.\nLooking abroad through England, he was filled\nWith deep commiseration, for the jails\u2014\nThe loathsome, filthy jails\u2014were crowded with\nHis brethren in the Truth. For their relief,\nHe sought the ear of royalty, and plead\nTheir cruel sufferings; and their innocence;\nAnd thus became the instrument through which\nSome prison doors were opened. But he sought\nA place of refuge from oppression's power,\nThat Friends might worship the Creator there,\nFree from imprisonment and penalties.\nAnd such a place soon opened to his view,\nFar in the Western Wilderness, beyond\nThe Atlantic's wave.\nAnd here is William Penn, and here a band\nOf weary emigrants, who now behold\nThe promised land before them; but it is\nThe Indian's country, and the Indian's home.\nPenn had indeed, received a royal grant,\nTo occupy it; but a grant from one\nWho had no rightful ownership therein;\nHe therefore buys it honestly from those\nWhose claims are aboriginal, and just.\nWith these inhabitants, behold, he stands\nBeneath an ancient elm, whose spreading limbs\nO'erhang the Delaware. The forest chiefs\nSit in grave silence, while the pipe of peace\nGoes round the circle. They have made a league\nWith faithful Onas\u2014a perpetual league,\nAnd treaty of true friendship, to endure\nWhile the sun shines, and while the waters run.\nAnd here was founded in the wilderness,\nA refuge from oppression, where all creeds\nFound toleration, and where truth and right\nWere the foundation of its government,\nAnd its protection. In that early day,\nThe infant colony sought no defence\nBut that of justice and of righteousness;\nThe only guarantees of peace on earth,\nBecause they ever breathe, good will to men.\nHis colony thus planted, William Penn\nSought his old field of labour, and again,\nBoth through the press and vocally, he plead\nThe right of conscience, and the rights of man;\nAnd frequently, and forcibly he preached\nChrist's universal and inshining Light.\nHis labour was incessant; and the cares,\nAnd the perplexities connected with\nHis distant province, which he visited\nA second time, bore heavily upon\nHis burdened spirit, which demanded rest;\u2014\nThat rest was granted. In the midst of all\nHis labour and his trials, there was drawn\nA veil, in mercy, round his active mind,\nWhich dimmed all outward things; but he still saw\nThe beauty and the loveliness of Truth,\nAnd found sweet access to the Source of good.\nAnd thus, shut out from the perplexities\nAnd sorrows of the world, he was prepared\nTo hear the final summons, to put off\nHis tattered garments, and be clothed upon\nWith heavenly raiment.\nScotland, thou hadst a noble citizen,\nIn him of Ury! Born amid thy hills,\nThough educated where enticing scenes,\nCrowd giddy Paris, he rejected all\nThe world's allurements, and unlike the youth\nWho talked with Jesus, Barclay turned away\nFrom great possessions, and embraced the Truth.\nHe early dedicated all the powers\nOf a well cultivated intellect\nTo the Redeemer and His holy cause.\nHe was a herald, to proclaim aloud,\nGlad tidings of salvation; and his life\nPreached a loud sermon by its purity.\nNot only were his lips made eloquent,\nBy the live coal that touched them, but his pen,\nMoved by a force from the same altar, poured\nLight, truth, and wisdom. From it issued forth\nThe great Apology, which yet remains\nOne of the best expositors of Truth\nThat man has published, since that sacred book\nAnciently written. Seekers are still led\nBy its direction, to that blessed Light,\nAnd inward Teacher, who is Jesus Christ.\nBut now, this noble servant of the Lord,\nRests from his faithful labour, while his works\nYet follow him.\nEarly believers in the light of Truth,\nDwelt not at ease in Zion. They endured\nConflicts and trials, and imprisonments.\nEven the humble Penington, whose mind\nSeemed purged and purified from all the dross\nOf human nature\u2014who appeared as meek\nAnd harmless as an infant\u2014was compelled\nTo dwell in loathsome prisons. But he had,\nThough in the midst of wickedness, sublime\nAnd holy visions of the purity,\nAnd the true nature of Christ's living Church.\nWhile Edmundson, the faithful pioneer\nOf Truth in Ireland, was compelled to drink\nDeeply of suffering for the blessed cause.\nDragged from his home, half naked, by a mob\nWho laid that home in ashes, he endured\nHeart-rending cruelties. But all of these,\nStars of the morning, felt oppression's hand,\nAnd some endured it to the closing scene.\nBurroughs, a noble servant of the Lord,\nWhose lips and pen were eloquent for Truth,\nDrew his last breath in prison. Parnel, too,\nA young and valiant soldier of the Lamb,\nDied, a true martyr in a dungeon's gloom.\nHowgill and Hubberthorn, both ministers\nOf Christ's ordaining, were released from all\nTheir earthly trials within prison walls.\nAnd beside these, there was a multitude\nOf faithful men, and noble women too,\nWho past from scenes of conflict, to the joys\nOf the Redeemer's kingdom, within jails,\nAnd some in dungeons. But amid it all,\nLight spread in Britain, and a living Church\nWas greatly multiplied. The tender minds,\nEven of children, felt the power of Truth,\nAnd showed the fruit and firmness it affords.\nWhen persecution, rioted within\nThe town of Bristol, and all older Friends\nWere locked in prison, little children met,\nWithin their place of worship, by themselves,\nTo offer praises, in the very place\nFrom which their parents had been dragged to jail.\nBut let us turn from Britain, and look down,\nUpon an inland sea whose swelling waves\nEncircle Malta. There a cloudless sun,\nIn Eastern beauty, pours its light upon\nThe Inquisition. All without its walls\nSeems calm and peaceful, let us look within.\nThere, stretched upon the floor, within a close,\nDark, narrow cell, inhaling from a crack\nA breath of purer air, two women lie.\nBut who are these, and wherefore are they here?\nThese are two ministers of Christ, who left\nTheir homes in England, faithfully to bear,\nThe Saviour's message into eastern lands.\nAnd here at Malta they were seized upon\nBy bigotted intolerance, and shut\nWithin this fearful engine of the Pope.\nPriests and Inquisitor assail them here,\nAnd urge the claims of popery. The rack,\nAnd cruel deaths are threatened; and again\nSweet liberty is offered, as the price\nOf their apostacy. All, all in vain!\nFor years these tender women have been thus,\nVictims of cruelty. At times apart,\nConfined in gloomy, solitary cells.\nBut all these efforts to convert them failed:\nThe Inquisition had not power enough\nTo shake their faith and confidence in Him,\nWhose holy presence was seen anciently\nTo save his children from devouring flames;\nHe, from this furnace of affliction, brought\nThese persecuted women, who came forth\nOut of the burning, with no smell of fire\nUpon their garments, and again they trod,\nTheir native land rejoicing.\nIn Hungary, two ministers of Christ,\nWere stretched upon the rack. Their tortured limbs\nWere almost torn asunder, but no force\nCould tear them from their Master, and they came\nOut of the furnace, well refined gold.\nNor were these all who suffered for the cause\nOf truth and righteousness, in foreign lands.\nFor at Mequinez and Algiers, some toiled,\nAnd died in slavery. But nothing could\nDiscourage faithful messengers of Christ\nFrom his required service. They were found\nPreaching repentance where the Israelites\nOnce toiled in Egypt, and the ancient Nile\nStill rolls its waters. And the holy light\nOf the eternal Gospel was proclaimed,\nWhere its great Author had first published it\u2014\nWhere the rich temple of King Solomon,\nStood in its ancient glory. Even there,\nThe haughty Musselmen, were told of Him,\nThe one great Prophet, who now speaks within.\nFor their refusing to participate\nIn carnal warfare, many early Friends,\nWere made to suffer. On a ship of war\nEquipped for battle, Richard Sellers bore,\nWith a meek, Christian spirit, cruelties\nThe most atrocious, for obeying Him\nWho was his heavenly Captain, and by whom,\nWar is forbidden. Sellers would not touch,\nThe instruments of carnage, nor could all\nThe cruelties inflicted, move his soul\nFrom a reliance on that holy Arm,\nWhich had sustained him in the midst of all\nHis complicated trials; and he gained\nA peaceful, but a greater victory\nThan that of battle, for he wearied out\nOppression, by his constancy, and left\nA holy savor, with that vessel's crew.\nBut let us turn from persecuting scenes,\nThat stain the annals of the older world,\nTo young America, whose virgin shores\nOffer a refuge from oppression's power.\nHere lies a harbour in the noble bay\nOf Massachusetts. Many little isles\nDot its expanding waters, and Nahant\nSpreads its long beach and eminence beyond,\nA barrier to the ocean. The whole scene,\nLooks beautiful, in the clear northern air,\nAnd loveliness of morning. On the heights\nThat overlook the harbour, there is seen\nAn infant settlement. Let us approach,\nAnd anchor where the Puritans have sought,\nFor liberty of conscience. But there seems,\nDisquietude in Boston. Men appear\nUrged on by stormy passions, and some wear\nA look of unrelenting bitterness.\nBut what is that now rising into view,\nWhere crowds are gathered on an eminence?\nThese are the Puritans. They now surround\nA common gallows. On its platform, stands\nA lovely woman in the simple garb\nWorn by the early Quakers. Of the throng,\nShe only seems unmoved, although her blood\nThey madly thirst for.\nThe first professors of Christ's inward Light,\nWho brought this message into Boston bay,\nWere inoffensive women. They were searched\nFor signs of witchcraft, and their books were burned.\nThe captain who had brought them, was compelled\nTo carry them away. But others came,\nBoth men and women, zealous for the Truth.\nThese were received with varied cruelties\u2014\nBy frequent whippings and imprisonments.\nLaw after law was made excluding them;\nBut all in vain, for still these faithful ones\nCarried their Master's message undismayed\nAmong the Puritans, and still they found\nThose who received it, and embraced the Truth,\nAnd steadily maintained it, in the midst\nOf whipping posts, and pillories, and jails!\nA law was then enacted, by which all\nThe banished Quakers, who were found again\nWithin the province, were to suffer death.\nBut these, though ever ready to obey\nAll just enactments, when laws trespassed on\nThe rights of conscience, and on God's command,\nCould never for a moment hesitate,\nWhich to obey.\u2014And soon there stood upon\nA scaffold of New England, faithful friends,\nWho, in obeying Christ, offended man!\nOf these was Mary Dyer, who exclaimed,\nWhile passing to this instrument of death,\n'No eye can witness, and no ear can hear,\nNo tongue can utter, nor heart understand\nThe incomes and refreshings from the Lord\nWhich now I feel.' And in the spirit which\nThese words a little pictured, Robinson,\nPast to the presence of that Holy One\nFor whom he laboured, and in whom he died.\nThen Stevenson, another faithful steward\nAnd servant of the Lamb, was ushered from\nDeep scenes of suffering into scenes of joy.\nBut Mary Dyer, who was all prepared,\nTo join these martyrs in their heavenward flight,\nWas left a little longer upon earth.\nBut a few fleeting months had rolled away,\nEre this devoted woman felt constrained,\nAgain to go among the Puritans,\nIn Massachusetts, and in Boston too.\nAnd here she stands! the second time, upon\nA gallows of New England. No reprieve\nArrests her sentence now. But still she feels\nThe same sweet incomes, and refreshing streams\nFrom the Lord's Holy Spirit. In the midst\nOf that excited multitude, she seems\nThe most resigned and peaceful.\u2014But the deed\nIs now accomplished, and the scene is closed!\nAmong the faithful martyrs of the Lamb,\nGathered forever round His Holy Throne,\nShe doubtless wears a pure and spotless robe,\nAnd bears the palm of victory.\nThe blood of Leddra was soon after shed,\nWhich closed the scene of martyrdom among\nThe early Quakers in this colony,\nBut not the scene of suffering. Women were\nDragged through its towns half-naked, tied to carts,\nWhile the lash fell upon their unclothed backs,\nAnd bloody streets, showed where they past along.\nAnd such inhuman treatment was bestowed\nOn the first female minister of Christ,\nWho preached the doctrine of his inward Light.\nBut in New England, there was really found\nA refuge from oppression, justice reigned\nUpon Rhode Island. In that early day,\nThe rights of conscience were held sacred there,\nAnd persecution was a thing unknown.\nA bright example, as a governor,\nWas William Coddington. He loved the law\u2014\nThe perfect law of righteousness\u2014and strove\nTo govern by it; and all faithful Friends\nFelt him a brother in the blessed Truth.\nIn North America, the Puritans\nStood not alone in efforts to prevent\nThe introduction and the spread of light.\nThe Dutch plantation of New Amsterdam,\nSustained a measure of the evil work.\nThe savage cruelties inflicted on\nThe faithful Hodgson, have few parallels\nIn any age or country; but the Lord\nWas with His servant in the midst of all,\nAnd healed his tortured and his mangled frame.\nThe early Friends were bright and shining stars,\nFor they reflected the clear holy light\nThe Sun of Righteousness bestowed on them.\nThey followed no deceiving, transient glare\u2014\nNo ignis fatuus of bewildered minds;\nThey followed Jesus in the holiness\nOf His unchanging Gospel. They endured\nStripes and imprisonment and pillories,\nTorture and slavery and banishment,\nAnd even death; but they would not forsake\nTheir Holy Leader, or His blessed cause.\nTheir patient suffering, and firm steadfastness,\nSecured a rich inheritance for those\nWho have succeeded them. Do these now feel\nThat firm devotion to the cause of Truth\u2014That\nsingleheartedness their fathers felt?\nDo they appreciate the price and worth\nOf the great legacy and precious trust\nHeld for their children? The great cruelties\nBorne by the fathers, have not been entailed\nOn their descendants, who now dwell at ease.\nThe world does not revile them. Do not some\nLove it the more for this? and do they not\nMake more alliance with it, and partake\nMore and more freely of its tempting baits,\nIts fashions and its spirit? but are these\nMore pure and holy than they were of old,\nWhen in the light of Truth, their fathers saw\nThat deep corruption overspread the world?\nOther professors latterly have learned\nTo speak of Quakers with less bitterness\nThan when the name reproachfully was cast\nIn ridicule upon them. Has not this\nDrawn watchmen from the citadel of Truth?\nHas it not opened doors that had been closed,\nAnd should have been forever? And by these,\nHas not an enemy been stealing in,\nTo spoil the goods of many; to assail,\nAnd strive in secrecy to gather strength,\nTo overcome the citadel at last?\nIs it not thought illiberal to refuse\nAlliances with those who now profess\nRespect and friendship? Must the Quaker then\nBow in the house of Rimmon, saying, Lord\nPardon in this thy servant? Do not some\nFail to resist encroachments, when they come\nClothed in enticing words, and wear the guise\nOf charity and kindness, and are veiled,\nOr sweetened to the taste, by courtesy?\nBut is a snare less certain, when concealed\nBy some enticing bait? or is a ball\nLess sure and fatal, when it flies unheard,\nOr, when the hand that sends it is unseen,\nOr offers friendship? Did not Joab say,\n'Art thou in health my brother?' and appeared\nTo kiss Amasa, while he thrust his sword\nInto his life-blood? And when Jonas fled\nFrom the Lord's service, and the stormy waves\nThreatened the ship that bore him, was the cause\nNot found within it? Was there not a calm\nWhen he, whose disobedience to the Lord\nHad raised the tempest, was no longer there?\nTruth has a standard openly displayed,\nUntorn\u2014unsullied. Man indeed may change,\nAnd may forsake it; but the Standard still\nRemains immutable. May all who love\nThis Holy Banner, rally to it now!\nMay all whose dwellings are upon the sand,\nSeek for a building on that living Rock,\nWhich stands forever;\u2014for a storm has come\u2014\nA storm that tries foundations! Even now,\nThe flooding rains are falling, and the winds\nRapidly rising to a tempest, beat\nUpon all dwellings. They alone can stand\nWhich have the Rock beneath them, and above\nThe Omnipresent and Omnipotent\nCreator and Defender of His Church!"}
