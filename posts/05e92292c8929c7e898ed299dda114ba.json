{"subject": "Only A Loan", "text": "The gift comes wrapped in mortal threads,\n To spend the years allotted them,\n In quiet peace or frequent pain\n Together doing what they deign.\n\n The gift is life, once given, lives\n Beyond a single breath of time.\n The package, all alone, returns\n To ashes in a soon forgotten urn.\n\n The gift of life is just a loan\n To be returned without a scar\n On dates determined, not to cut short\n By self or through the folly to abort."}
