{"subject": "X: And Must I Sing?", "text": "And must I sing? what subject shall I chuse?\nOr whose great name in Poets heaven use?\nFor the more countenance to my active Muse?\n\nHercules? alas his bones are yet sore,\nWith his old earthly labours. T'exact more,\nOf his dull god-head, were sinne. Ile implore\n\nPhoebus? No. tend thy cart still. Envious day\nShall not give out, that I have made thee stay,\nAnd foundred thy hot teame, to tune my lay.\n\nNor will I begge of thee, Lord of the vine,\nTo raise my spirits with thy conjuring wine,\nIn the greene circle of thy Ivie twine.\n\nPallas, nor thee I call on, mankind maid,\nThat, at thy birth, mad'st the poore Smith affraid,\nWho, with his axe, thy fathers mid-wife plaid.\n\nGoe, crampe dull Mars, light Venus, when he snorts,\nOr, with thy Tribade trine, invent new sports.\nThou, nor thy loosenesse with my making sorts.\n\nLet the old Boy, your sonne, ply his old taske,\nTurne the stale prologue to some painted maske,\nHis absence in my verse, is all I aske.\n\nHermes, the cheater, shall not mix with us,\nThough hee would steale his sisters Pegasus,\nAnd riffle him: or pawne his Petasus.\n\nNor all the ladies of the Thespian lake,\n(Though they were crusht into one forme) could make\nA beautie of that merit, that should take\n\nMy Muse up by commission: No, I bring\nMy owne true fire. Now my thought takes wing,\nAnd now an Epode to deepe eares I sing."}
