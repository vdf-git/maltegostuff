{"subject": "To The Earl Of Carlisle, K. G.", "text": "I. 1.\n\nRetired, remote from human noise,\nAn humble Poet dwelt serene;\nHis lot was lowly, yet his joys\nWere manifold, I ween.\nHe laid him by the brawling brook\nAt eventide to ruminate,\nHe watch'd the swallow skimming round,\nAnd mused, in reverie profound,\nOn wayward man's unhappy state,\nAnd ponder'd much, and paused on deeds of ancient date.\n\nII. 1.\n\n'Oh, 'twas not always thus,' he cried,\n'There was a time, when genius claim'd\nRespect from even towering pride,\nNor hung her head ashamed:\nBut now to wealth alone we bow,\nThe titled and the rich alone\nAre honour'd, while meek merit pines,\nOn penury's wretched couch reclines,\nUnheeded in his dying moan,\nAs, overwhelmed with want and woe, he sinks unknown.\n\nIII. 1.\n\n'Yet was the muse not always seen\nIn poverty's dejected mien,\nNot always did repining rue,\nAnd misery her steps pursue.\nTime was, when nobles thought their titles graced\nBy the sweet honours of poetic bays,\nWhen Sidney sung his melting song,\nWhen Sheffield join'd the harmonious throng,\nAnd Lyttelton attuned to love his lays.\nThose days are gone-alas, for ever gone!\nNo more our nobles love to grace\nTheir brows with anadems, by genius won,\nBut arrogantly deem the muse as base;\nHow differently thought the sires of this degenerate race!'\n\nI. 2.\n\nThus sang the minstrel:-still at eve\nThe upland's woody shades among\nIn broken measures did he grieve,\nWith solitary song.\nAnd still his shame was aye the same,\nNeglect had stung him to the core;\nAnd he with pensive joy did love\nTo seek the still congenial grove,\nAnd muse on all his sorrows o'er,\nAnd vow that he would join the abjured world no more.\n\nII. 2.\n\nBut human vows, how frail they be!\nFame brought Carlisle unto his view,\nAnd all amazed, he thought to see\nThe Augustan age anew.\nFill'd with wild rapture, up he rose,\nNo more he ponders on the woes\nWhich erst he felt that forward goes,\nRegrets he'd sunk in impotence,\nAnd hails the ideal day of virtuous eminence.\n\nIII. 2.\n\nAh! silly man, yet smarting sore\nWith ills which in the world he bore,\nAgain on futile hope to rest,\nAn unsubstantial prop at best,\nAnd not to know one swallow makes no summer!\nAh! soon he'll find the brilliant gleam,\nWhich flash'd across the hemisphere,\nIllumining the darkness there,\nWas but a single solitary beam,\nWhile all around remained in custom'd night.\nStill leaden ignorance reigns serene,\nIn the false court's delusive height,\nAnd only one Carlisle is seen\nTo illume the heavy gloom with pure and steady light."}
