{"subject": "The Love Sonnets Of Proteus.  Part Iv: Vita Nova: Lxxxix", "text": "THE LIMIT OF HUMAN KNOWLEDGE\nThere is a vice in the world's reasoning. Man\nHas conquered knowledge. He has conquered power;\nHe has traced out the universal plan\nOf the Earth's being; and in this last hour\nHe has unmade the God which he had made.\nI cannot doubt but he at length has read\nThe riddle of the Earth; that he is wise.\nHe also hath dominion charter\u00e8d\nOver the lands, the oceans, and the skies,\nWhich toil and sweat to give him daily bread.\n--Knowledge he hath, and power upon the Earth,\nAnd long ago he had himself been God,\nBut for the cruel secret of his birth,\nWhich gave him kindred with the dust he trod,\nAnd for the hideous ending of his mirth,\nA fly--blown carrion festering 'neath the sod."}
