{"subject": "Only A Smile", "text": "No butterfly whose frugal fare \nIs breath of heliotrope and clove, \nAnd other trifles light as air, \nCould live on less than doth my love. \n\nThat childlike smile that comes and goes \nAbout your gracious lips and eyes, \nHath all the sweetness of the rose, \nWhich feeds the freckled butterflies. \n\nI feed my love on smiles, and yet \nSometimes I ask, with tears of woe, \nHow had it been if we had met, \nIf you had met me long ago, \n\nBefore the fast, defacing years \nHad made all ill that once was well? \nAh, then your smiling breeds such tears \nAs Tantalus may weep in hell."}
