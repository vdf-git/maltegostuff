{"subject": "One Need Not Be A Chamber To Be Haunted,", "text": "One need not be a chamber to be haunted,\nOne need not be a house;\nThe brain has corridors surpassing\nMaterial place.\n\nFar safer, of a midnight meeting\nExternal ghost,\nThan an interior confronting\nThat whiter host.\n\nFar safer through an Abbey gallop,\nThe stones achase,\nThan, moonless, one's own self encounter\nIn lonesome place.\n\nOurself, behind ourself concealed,\nShould startle most;\nAssassin, hid in our apartment,\nBe horror's least.\n\nThe prudent carries a revolver,\nHe bolts the door,\nO'erlooking a superior spectre\nMore near."}
