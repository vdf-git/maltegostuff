{"subject": "The Road", "text": "These are roads to take when you think of your country\nand interested bring down the maps again,\nphoning the statistician, asking the dear friend,\n\nreading the papers with morning inquiry.\nOr when you sit at the wheel and your small light\nchooses gas gauge and clock; and the headlights\n\nindicate future or road, your wish pursuing\npast the junction, the fork, the suburban station,\nwell-travelled six-lane highway planned for safety.\n\nPast your tall central city\u2019s influence,\noutside its body: traffic, penumbral crowds,\nare centers removed and strong, fighting for good\n                  reason.\n\nThese roads will take you into your own country.\nSelect the mountains, follow rivers back,\ntravel the passes. Touch West Virginia where\n\nthe Midland Trail leaves the Virginia furnace,\niron Clifton Forge, Covington iron, goes down\ninto the wealthy valley, resorts, the chalk hotel.\n\nPillars and fairway; spa; White Sulphur Springs.\nAirport. Gay blank rich faces wishing to add\nhistory to ballrooms, tradition to the first tee.\n\nThe simple mountains, sheer, dark-graded with pine\nin the sudden weather, wet outbreak of spring,\ncrosscut by snow, wind at the hill\u2019s shoulder.\n\nThe land is fierce here, steep, braced against snow,\nrivers and spring. KING COAL HOTEL, Lookout,\nand swinging the vicious bend, New River Gorge.\n\nNow the photographer unpacks camera and case,\nsurveying the deep country, follows discovery\nviewing on groundglass an inverted image.\n\nJohn Marshall named the rock (steep pines, a drop\nhe reckoned in 1812, called) Marshall Pillar,\nbut later, Hawk\u2019s Nest. Here is your road, tying\n\nyou to its meanings: gorge, boulder, precipice.\nTelescoped down, the hard and stone-green river\ncutting fast and direct into the town."}
