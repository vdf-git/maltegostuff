{"subject": "As Ye Came From The Holy Land", "text": "As ye came from the holy land\nOf Walsinghame,\nMet you not with my true love\nBy the way as you came?\n\nHow should I know your true love,\nThat have met many a one\nAs I came from the holy land,\nThat have come, that have gone?\n\nShe is neither white nor brown,\nBut as the heavens fair;\nThere is none hath her form divine\nIn the earth or the air.\n\nSuch a one did I meet, good sir,\nSuch an angelic face,\nWho like a nymph, like a queen, did appear\nIn her gait, in her grace.\n\nShe hath left me here alone\nAll alone, as unknown,\nWho sometime did me lead with herself,\nAnd me loved as her own.\n\nWhat's the cause that she leaves you alone\nAnd a new way doth take,\nThat sometime did love you as her own,\nAnd her joy did you make?\n\nI have loved her all my youth,\nBut now am old, as you see:\nLove likes not the falling fruit,\nNor the withered tree.\n\nKnow that Love is a careless child,\nAnd forgets promise past:\nHe is blind, he is deaf when he list,\nAnd in faith never fast.\n\nHis desire is a dureless content,\nAnd a trustless joy;\nHe is won with a world of despair,\nAnd is lost with a toy.\n\nOf womenkind such indeed is the love,\nOr the word love abused,\nUnder which many childish desires\nAnd conceits are excused.\n\nBut true love is a durable fire,\nIn the mind ever burning,\nNever sick, never dead, never cold,\nFrom itself never turning."}
