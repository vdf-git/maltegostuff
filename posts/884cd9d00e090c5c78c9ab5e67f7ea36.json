{"subject": "The Embrace", "text": "You weren't well or really ill yet either;\njust a little tired, your handsomeness\ntinged by grief or anticipation, which brought\nto your face a thoughtful, deepening grace.\n\nI didn't for a moment doubt you were dead.\nI knew that to be true still, even in the dream.\nYou'd been out--at work maybe?--\nhaving a good day, almost energetic.\n\nWe seemed to be moving from some old house\nwhere we'd lived, boxes everywhere, things\nin disarray: that was the story of my dream,\nbut even asleep I was shocked out of the narrative\n\nby your face, the physical fact of your face:\ninches from mine, smooth-shaven, loving, alert.\nWhy so difficult, remembering the actual look\nof you? Without a photograph, without strain?\n\nSo when I saw your unguarded, reliable face,\nyour unmistakable gaze opening all the warmth\nand clarity of you--warm brown tea--we held\neach other for the time the dream allowed.\n\nBless you. You came back, so I could see you\nonce more, plainly, so I could rest against you\nwithout thinking this happiness lessened anything,\nwithout thinking you were alive again."}
