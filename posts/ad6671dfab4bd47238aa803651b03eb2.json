{"subject": "Life's Tempest", "text": "Upon life's tempest-troubled seas afloat,\nWe strike worse rocks than shipwrecked sailors know;\nWich Chance the pilot of our storm-tossed boat,\nUpon a doubtful dangerous voyage we go;\nThough some fair weather, and some foul have found,\nWe all meet in one haven underground.\n\ntranslated by Jane Minot Sedgwick"}
