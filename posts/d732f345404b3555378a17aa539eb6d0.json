{"subject": "Lesbia Hath A Beaming Eye", "text": "Lesbia hath a beaming eye, \nBut no one knows for whom it beameth; \nRight and left its arrows fly, \nBut what they aim at no one dreameth. \nSweeter 'tis to gaze upon \nMy Nora's lid that seldom rises; \nFew its looks, but every one, \nLike unexpected light, surprises! \nOh, my Nora Creina, dear, \nMy gentle, bashful Nora Creina, \nBeauty lies \nIn many eyes, \nBut Love in yours, my Nora Creina. \n\nLesbia wears a robe of gold, \nBut all so close the nymph hath laced it, \nNot a charm of beauty's mould \nPresumes to stay where Nature placed it. \nOh! my Nora's gown for me, \nThat floats as wild as mountain breezes, \nLeaving every beauty free \nTo sink or swell as Heaven pleases. \nYes, my Nora Creina, dear, \nMy simple, graceful Nora Creina, \nNature's dress \nIs loveliness -- \nThe dress you wear, my Nora Creina. \n\nLesbia hath a wit refined, \nBut, when its points are gleaning round us, \nWho can tell if they're design'd \nTo dazzle merely, or to wound us? \nPillow'd on my Nora's heart, \nIn safer slumber Love reposes -- \nBed of peace! whose roughest part \nIs but the crumpling of the roses. \nOh! my Nora Creina, dear, \nMy mild, my artless Nora Creina! \nWit, though bright, \nHath no such light \nAs warms your eyes, my Nora Creina."}
