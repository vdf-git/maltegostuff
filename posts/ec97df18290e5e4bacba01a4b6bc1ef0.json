{"subject": "The Weak Poet", "text": "When a poet is weak,\nlike a broken microphone,\nhe still has some power,\nindicated by a red light.\n\nThe weak poet\nis fixed to the wall\nlike an ordinary light.\n\nDependent and dismal by turns,\nhe is a nominalist\nand a razor blade\nand a light.\n\nAnd the demons cry,\nCast him from the kingdom\nfor a copy of a copy!\n\nRemove him\nlike the women who supported the temple \u2014\nslaves too free and alive.\nHis similes are ingenious, like science among lovers.\n\nMy friend, however early\nyou called, you had come\ntoo late, again.\n\nThe weak poet\nhas not gone grey\nbut his sacrificed similes\nlead nowhere.\n\nAnd his I is like any other word\nin the newspaper and he is cut up\nlike fashion.\n\nEach window was seductive,\nbut even his diseases could be cured.\nYour low voice alone\nis major like a skepticism.\n\nWe had forgotten\nthe place and the stories,\nand the fiery method, too familiar, too distant.\n\nWe had memorized the poems,\nbut only for prison.\nWith the first new year celebrated in chaos\nabove the red waters of Paradise.\n\nWhere a clayey groom\nhears the bride's voice\nlike a stronger world \u2014\n\nSound is all\na snake can do \u2014\nand charming sense\nand strangeness.\n\nNow the old poet\nloses his voice like a garden.\nBut finds it again, like a street in a garden.\n\nIn the injured house\nmade of local sun and stone \u2014\nIn the city of numbers\nwhich everyone counts and hates and wants\u2014\n\nWe could read together in a dark city garden,\nscribbling with language over\nscreens like lips, scribbling the first mistranslations."}
