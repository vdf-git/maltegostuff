{"subject": "To Mr. Congreve", "text": "As Merchants whose sunk Trade, and ebbing Stocks\nFear every Storm, and dread the lurking Rocks,\nAbove her real Worth their Bark ensure,\nThen careless hug themselves, and sleep secure;\nThey hear of Wrecks, and fear no inward Pain,\nBut seeming Losses bring a real Gain.\nSo, would your Smiles protect the fearful Muse,\nThe vulgar Praise I would with Scorn refuse.\nBy you approv'd, condemn'd by all beside,\nI'd court my Fate, and swell with careless Pride.\nSince novel Treats our modern Gusts persue,\nI hop'd at least to please by something new.\nThe Muse long sought the Woods, and mossy Caves,\nDespis'd the Seas, and fear'd the rowling Waves,\nThe flowry Meadows, and the whispering Trees\nHave oft been sung, and will hereafter please.\nCool shady Grots, and gently rising Hills,\nAnd the soft Murmurs of complaining Rills,\nIn antient Verse describ'd their Sweets convey,\nAnd still succeeding Bards repeat the grateful Lay.\nBut the vast unseen Mansions of the Deep,\nWhere secret Groves with liquid Amber weep,\nWhere blushing Sprigs of knotty Coral spread\nAnd gild the Azure with a brighter red,\nWere still untouch'd-\nBeside the Muse has no envenom'd Rage,\nNo Party-wars her Innocence engage,\nNor partial Falshoods stain the guilty Page.\nShe loves no pompous Sound, or lofty Strain,\nOr soars to Sense obscure with awkward Pain,\nBut would plain Songs in artless Verse contrive,\nAnd humbly modest only asks to Dive.\nJoys free, and undisturb'd, and endless Loves\nThe Triton seeks, and ev'ry Nymph approves.\nBut should the harmless Pen have no Regard,\nYour Name (like sacred Spells that charm when heard\nFrom blasting Tongues secures the tender Bard,\nThe beauteous Nymphs to your Protection throng,\nAnd beg, you would not scorn the humble Song:\nAs Indian Travellers Wild Beasts affright\nBy kindled Fires, and skreen themselves with Light.\nSo Critick-wits, like other Brutes of Prey,\nFrom a surrounding Brightness slink away.\nMen dare not censure (even when they ought)\nIf Virgil will approve what M\u00e6vius wrote."}
