{"subject": "Pour Out Your Sorrows, My Heart (Verse XLVI)", "text": "Pour out your sorrows, my heart,\nBut let none discover where;\nFor my pride makes me forbear\nMy heart's sorrows to impart.\n\nI love you, Verse, my friend true,\nBecause when in pieces torn\nMy heart's too burdened, you've borne\nAll my sorrows upon you.\n\nFor me you suffer and bear\nUpon your amorous lap\nEvery anguish, every slap\nThat my painful love leaves there.\n\nThat I may love, in peace with all,\nAnd do good works, as my goal,\nYou thrash your waves, rise and fall,\nWith whatever weighs my soul.\n\nThat I may cross with fierce stride,\nPure and without hate, this vale,\nYou drag yourself, hard and pale,\nThe loving friend at my side.\n\nAnd so my life its way will wend\nTo the sky serene and pure,\nWhile you my sorrows endure\nAnd with divine patience tend.\n\nBecause I know this cruel habit\nOf throwing myself on you\nUpsets your harmony true\nAnd tries your gentle spirit;\n\nBecause on your breast I've shed\nAll of my sorrows and torments,\nAnd have whipped your quiet currents,\nWhich are here white and there red,\n\nAnd then pale as death become,\nAt once roaring and attacking,\nAnd then beneath the weight cracking\nOf pain it can't overcome: \u2014\n\nShould I the advice have taken\nOf a heart so misbegotten,\nWould have me leave you forgotten\nWho never me has forsaken?\n\nVerse, there's a God, they aver\nTo whom the dying appealed;\nVerse, as one our fates our sealed:\nWe are damned or saved together!"}
