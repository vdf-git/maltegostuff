{"subject": "Oft Have I Vow'D", "text": "Oft have I vow'd how dearly I did love thee,\nAnd oft observ'd thee with all willing duty,\nSighs I have sent, still hoping to remove thee:\nMillions of tears I tender'd to thy beauty,\nYet thou of sighs and silly tears regardless,\nSuff'rest my feeble heart to pine with anguish,\nWhilst all my barren hopes return rewardless,\nMy bitter days do waste, and I do languish."}
