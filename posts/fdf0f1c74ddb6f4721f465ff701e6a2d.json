{"subject": "The Rose Of Battle", "text": "ROSE of all Roses, Rose of all the World!\nThe tall thought-woven sails, that flap unfurled\nAbove the tide of hours, trouble the air,\nAnd God's bell buoyed to be the water's care;\nWhile hushed from fear, or loud with hope, a band\nWith blown, spray-dabbled hair gather at hand,\nTurn if you may from battles never done,\nI call, as they go by me one by one,\nDanger no refuge holds, and war no peace,\nFor him who hears love sing and never cease,\nBeside her clean-swept hearth, her quiet shade:\nBut gather all for whom no love hath made\nA woven silence, or but came to cast\nA song into the air, and singing passed\nTo smile on the pale dawn; and gather you\nWho have sougft more than is in rain or dew,\nOr in the sun and moon, or on the earth,\nOr sighs amid the wandering, starry mirth,\nOr comes in laughter from the sea's sad lips,\nAnd wage God's battles in the long grey ships.\nThe sad, the lonely, the insatiable,\nTo these Old Night shall all her mystery tell;\nGod's bell has claimed them by the little cry\nOf their sad hearts, that may not live nor die.\nRose of all Roses, Rose of all the World!\nYou, too, have come where the dim tides are hurled\nUpon the wharves of sorrow, and heard ring\nThe bell that calls us on; the sweet far thing.\nBeauty grown sad with its eternity\nMade you of us, and of the dim grey sea.\nOur long ships loose thought-woven sails and wait,\nFor God has bid them share an equal fate;\nAnd when at last, defeated in His wars,\nThey have gone down under the same white stars,\nWe shall no longer hear the little cry\nOf our sad hearts, that may not live nor die."}
