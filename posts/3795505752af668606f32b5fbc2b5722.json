{"subject": "Before Sunrise", "text": "In the dark many bird voices call,\n\nThe trees and the springs murmur noisily,\n\nIn the clouds a rose-colored glow sounds\n\nLike early love's distress. The night blues away -\n\nWith shy hands the twilight softly polishes\n\nThe love lair, feverishly stirred up,\n\nAnd lets the drunkenness of languished kisses end\n\nIn dreams, smiling and felt half-awake."}
