{"subject": "All Summer It Rained", "text": "It rained every day that summer \nwe stayed on Lacewood \nI remember the street outside \nbecame a torrent around dusk \nwhen the sewers and stormdrains \natop our street spilled over \nand ran downhill \nseeking a covenant with the ocean \nIt stormed and the thunder spanked \nthe lonesome midnight air \nand you said - \n'I've almost forgotten warmth \nor what it looks like when \nthe bed is half in shadow- \nand I never want it any other way' \n\nWe checked our arms for spiders \nWe chased our spirits through the night \nWe searched each others back \nfor lost kisses and blemish \nWe kept warm \nAnd we smiled at each other \nin a vague, familiar smile \nnever waiting for the rain \nalways knowing it would come again \nand the streets would become rivers \nand the grasses soaked and muddy \nand our shoes would sing in squeaks \n\nWe laughed at every window left open \nWe laughed at every dropp we dripped \nfrom our noses and onto the curious pets \nwaiting like statues \ncloaked in simple black velvet. \nWe never wanted cover \nWe always liked the rain \nAnd we never, \nnot even for a moment, \nmissed the sun again."}
