{"subject": "My thought raised me to a place in which", "text": "\u2018Levommi il mio penser in parte ov'era'\n\nMy thought raised me to a place in which\nshe was whom I seek, and cannot find on earth:\nthere, among those who are in the third circle,\nI saw her once more, more beautiful and less proud.\nShe took my hand, and said: \u2018If my desire\nis not in error, you will be with me again in this sphere:\nI am she who made such war on you,\nand finished my day before the evening.\nMy good is not comprehended by human intellect:\nI wait only for you, and what you so loved,\nmy lovely veil, is joined to earth and stays there.'\nOh why did she fall silent, opening her hands?\nSince at the sound of such pure, compassionate speech\nlittle was needed for me to remain in heaven.\n\nTranslated by: A.
