{"subject": "Justification", "text": "See how the Rainbow in the skie\nSeems gaudy through the Suns bright eye;\nHarke how an Eccho answere makes,\nFeele how a board is smooth'd with waxe,\nSmell how a glove putts on perfume,\nTast how theyr sweetnesse pills assume:\nSo by imputed Justice, Clay\nSeemes faire, well spoke, smooth, sweet, each way.\n The eye doth gaze on robes appearing,\n The prompted Eccho takes our hearing,\n The board our touch, the sent our smell,\n The pill our tast: Man, God as well."}
