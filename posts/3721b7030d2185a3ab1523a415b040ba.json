{"subject": "England To Free Men", "text": "Men of my blood, you English men!\nFrom misty hill and misty fen,\nFrom cot, and town, and plough, and moor,\nCome in - before I shut the door!\nInto my courtyard paved with stones\nThat keep the names, that keep the bones,\nOf none but English men who came\nFree of their lives, to guard my fame.\n\nI am your native land who bred\nNo driven heart, no driven head;\nI fly a flag in every sea\nRound the old Earth, of Liberty!\nI am the Land that boasts a crown;\nThe sun comes up, the sun goes down -\nAnd never men may say of me,\nMine is a breed that is not free.\n\nI have a wreath! My forehead wears\nA hundred leaves - a hundred years\nI never knew the words: 'You must!'\nAnd shall my wreath return to dust?\nFreemen! The door is yet ajar;\nFrom northern star to southern star,\nO ye who count and ye who delve,\nCome in - before my clock strikes twelve!"}
