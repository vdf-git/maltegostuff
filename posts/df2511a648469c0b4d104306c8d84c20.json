{"subject": "The Return", "text": "I have come home again!\nDawn is a dream to me\nLying here, soon to be\nClinging, awaking;\nSee where \u2019tis breaking\nMockingly, mistily!\nI have come home again!\n\nI have come home again!\nBlithe is the day, and clear.\nAll of my youth is near.\nHere with the sun above;\nHere with my boyhood, love\nJoy, and a tear.\nI have come home again!\n\nI have come home again!\nGrand is the night to-night.\nStars shed their brightest light;\nShine all their brightest fire;\nShine with their old desire;\nWild with delight!\nI have come home again!\n\nI must away again!\nSince I have lived this day\nHere, now I cannot stay.\nBack, with the changing sky,\nI must away to die;\nDie in the proper way\nI must away again!"}
