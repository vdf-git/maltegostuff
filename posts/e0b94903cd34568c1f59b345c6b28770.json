{"subject": "XIV. 'Let all men see the ruins of the shrine'", "text": "Let all men see the ruins of the shrine\nThat I, with passionate and holy care,\nBuilt long ago from laughter and despair\nThat godly love might have a fane divine.\nLet the wide wings of darkness hover where\nThe god of youth once drank his rarest wine,\nAnd let the rank breath of some poisoned vine\nChoke the last sigh that lingers on the air.\n\nHurl the white sanctuary down, and bare\nIts inmost secrets to the gaze of men,\nUnveil the altar to the vulgar stare,\nAnd let none seek it build it up agin;\u2014\nAh, when the last wall crumbles, stone by stone,\nI shall go hence that I may weep alone."}
