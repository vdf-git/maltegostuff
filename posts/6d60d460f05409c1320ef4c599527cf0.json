{"subject": "Once It Was The Colour Of Saying", "text": "Once it was the colour of saying\nSoaked my table the uglier side of a hill\nWith a capsized field where a school sat still\nAnd a black and white patch of girls grew playing;\nThe gentle seaslides of saying I must undo\nThat all the charmingly drowned arise to cockcrow and kill.\nWhen I whistled with mitching boys through a reservoir park\nWhere at night we stoned the cold and cuckoo\nLovers in the dirt of their leafy beds,\nThe shade of their trees was a word of many shades\nAnd a lamp of lightning for the poor in the dark;\nNow my saying shall be my undoing,\nAnd every stone I wind off like a reel."}
