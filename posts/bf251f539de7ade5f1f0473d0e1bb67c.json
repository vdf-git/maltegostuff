{"subject": "Miracles Of Creation", "text": "Each one of us is a miracle of creation, every single one of us, \nin every single nation. \nLanguages there are many, colors there are few, \nbut if you look deep enough, you'll see there is nothing new. \nEach one of us is a miracle of creation. \nWe strive to treat ourselves and each other as such, \nto be worthy of this gift of life, \nwith our Creator, we must always be in touch. \nLife itself is our greatest celebration, \nto live in freedom is everybodys goal, \nto walk with pride and dignity, we must all pay the toll. \nWe search to find life's promise, to someday stand with Thee, \nto be worthy of Thy mercy, then forever more be free. \nThis soul that I call mine is only for a loan, \nno one can have a soul to call their very own. \nWhen life finally passes, and our dust rests in peace so fine, \nour soul will return to it's source, \nand for all eternity be Thine."}
