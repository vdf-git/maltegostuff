{"subject": "But That Was Long Ago", "text": "One day, 'twas long ago, \nI met a maiden fair to see, \nA maiden fair and dear to me\u2014 \nBut that was long ago. \n\nShe was so fair, I know; \nHow fair she was I cannot say, \nBut fairer than a morn of May\u2014 \nBut that was long ago. \n\nAnd we did make a vow \nThat we some day would wed, \nFollowing where sly Cupid led\u2014 \nBut that was long ago. \n\nThe years went slowly by\u2014 \nI know not where they went, \nInto what other forms were blent\u2014 \nPerhaps into a sigh. \n\nAnd then, we met, I know; \nBut all the fire of youth had fled, \nAnd all the love of youth was dead\u2014 \nBut that was long ago. \n\nAnd not a word, I vow, \nOf that dead past by us was said\u2014 \nWe each some other one had wed! \nBut that was long ago."}
