{"subject": "Strayed Crab", "text": "This is not my home. How did I get so far from water? It must \nbe over that way somewhere. \nI am the color of wine, of tinta. The inside of my powerful \nright claw is saffron-yellow. See, I see it now; I wave it like a \nflag. I am dapper and elegant; I move with great precision, \ncleverly managing all my smaller yellow claws. I believe in the \noblique, the indirect approach, and I keep my feelings to myself. \nBut on this strange, smooth surface I am making too much \nnoise. I wasn't meant for this. If I maneuver a bit and keep a \nsharp lookout, I shall find my pool again. Watch out for my right \nclaw, all passersby! This place is too hard. The rain has stopped, \nand it is damp, but still not wet enough to please me. \nMy eyes are good, though small; my shell is tough and tight. \nIn my own pool are many small gray fish. I see right through \nthem. Only their large eyes are opaque, and twitch at me. They \nare hard to catch but I, I catch them quickly in my arms and \neat them up. \nWhat is that big soft monster, like a yellow cloud, stifling \nand warm? What is it doing? It pats my back. Out, claw. There, \nI have frightened it away. It's sitting down, pretending nothing's \nhappened. I'll skirt it. It's still pretending not to see me. Out of \nmy way, O monster. I own a pool, all the little fish that swim in it, \nand all the skittering waterbugs that smell like rotten apples. \nCheer up, O grievous snail. I tap your shell, encouragingly, \nnot that you will ever know about it. \nAnd I want nothing to do with you, either, sulking toad. \nImagine, at least four times my size and yet so vulnerable... I \ncould open your belly with my claw. You glare and bulge, a \nwatchdog near my pool; you make a loud and hollow noise. I \ndo not care for such stupidity. I admire compression, lightness, \nand agility, all rare in this loose world."}
