{"subject": "The Martyr", "text": "(Indicative of the Passion of the People\non the 15th Day of April, 1865)\n* * *\n\nGood Friday was the day\nOf the prodigy and crime,\nWhen they killed him in his pity,\nWhen they killed him in his prime\nOf clemency and calm-\nWhen with yearning he was filled\nTo redeem the evil-willed,\nAnd, though conqueror, be kind;\nBut they killed him in his kindness,\nIn their madness and their blindness,\nAnd they killed him from behind.\n\nThere is sobbing of the strong,\nAnd a pall upon the land;\nBut the People in their weeping\nBare the iron hand;\nBeware the People weeping\nWhen they bare the iron hand.\n\nHe lieth in his blood-\nThe father in his face;\nThey have killed him, the Forgiver-\nThe Avenger takes his place,\nThe Avenger wisely stern,\nWho in righteousness shall do\nWhat the heavens call him to,\nAnd the parricides remand;\nFor they killed him in his kindness,\nIn their madness and their blindness,\nAnd his blood is on their hand.\n\nThere is sobbing of the strong,\nAnd a pall upon the land;\nBut the People in their weeping\nBare the iron hand;\nBeware the People weeping\nWhen they bare the iron hand."}
