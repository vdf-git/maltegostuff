{"subject": "Show Me!", "text": "I would rather see a Mason, than hear one any day,\nI would rather one would walk with me than merely show the way.\nThe eye's a better pupil and more willing than the ear,\nFine counsel is confusing, but example's always clear.\nAnd the best of all the Masons are the men who live their creeds,\nFor to see the good in action is what everybody needs.\n\nI can soon learn how to do it if you'll let me see it done,\nI can watch your hands in action, but your tongue too fast may run.\nAnd the lectures you deliver may be wise and true,\nBut I'd rather get my lesson by observing what you do.\nFor I may misunderstand you and the high advice you give,\nBut there's no misunderstanding how you act and how you live."}
