{"subject": "Aubade", "text": "The ambience of night creeps and swirls\nin a haze through me, to sift and curl\n\nin your ear as you drift into quiet\ndarkness, when I recognise it,\n\nits qualming tones, for what it is,\nand it holds me pinned in its icy hizz,\n\nits nauseous waves of arrhythmia;\nthen I wake up in a clapped-out Kia\n\nor junked Skoda in a car park,\nblown litter sounding sinister in the dark,\n\nand I fly for a nearby wood of yews\ntweeting where are you, I have been true,\n\nand how I miss the brightness,\nwild strawberries, fresh watercress,\n\nfor here grow only yew berries and yew\nneedles and I'm failing to\n\nfollow the thread as I'm thrown\nby winds over vacant city zones,\n\nvalleys of ice, razor mountains,\nas if the earth had eaten the heavens,\n\ngnawed to bone all I had known,\nand I fly over dry reservoirs, blown\n\nelectrical grids, ash-covered campuses,\nback to the yews dark as molasses\n\nbristling in the wind like the pelt\nof something surviving while rain welts\n\nmy skin, clouds expectorate,\nand I hear the waves crunch and grate\n\na song of ice and salt darkness coming through\u2014\nif you wake up tomorrow it cannot be you"}
