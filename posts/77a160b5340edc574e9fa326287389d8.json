{"subject": "Under The Pines", "text": "\"LIFE is sad,\" says the wind in the pines\n    To the still soul listening,\nWhile the pale, pale day declines\n    Like a white bird on the wing.\n\"Life is sad,\" says the quiet earth\n5\n    Under the churchyard wall,\nWhere the spring flowers have their birth\n    And the autumn leaflets fall.\n\"Life is sad,\" say the daisies that blow there\n    And stretch out their heads to the sun;\n10\n\"Life is sad,\" say the poor hearts that go there\n    To weep when the day's work is done.\n\"Life is sad,\" from below, from on high,\n    From forest and meadow and tree,\nFrom the clouds that drift over the sky\n15\n    And the days that die into the sea.\nThen up and be brave with thy sorrow,\n    Like a man with his face to the blast;\nNot from hope of the joys of to-morrow,\n    Nor rest when the warfare is past;\n20\n\nBut strong that weak souls may grow strong,\n    That men may take heart by the way,\nTill the heavens break forth with the song\n    That will herald eternal day."}
