{"subject": "Dorothy's Opinion", "text": "Mamma has bought a calendar,\nAnd every single page\nHas pictures on of little girls\n'Most just about my age.\n\nAnd when she bought it yesterday,\nDown at the big bazaar,\nShe said, 'What lovely little girls,\nHow true to life they are.'\n\nBut I don't think they're true to life,\nAnd I'll just tell you why;\nThey never have a rumpled frock\nOr ribbon bow awry.\n\nAnd though they play with cats and dogs,\nAnd rabbits and white mice,\nAnd sail their boats and fly their kites,\nThey always look so nice.\n\nAnd I am sure no little girl\nThat ever _I_ have seen,\nCould play with dogs or sail a boat\nAnd keep her frock so clean."}
