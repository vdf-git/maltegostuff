{"subject": "Wings", "text": "Impatient of the tardy axe and oar,\nLife clothes her tender flesh in toiling steel,\nAnd like a broken mist the years reveal\nThe unascended heights that wait before.\nMatter that was the king is king no more,\nAnd we, released from that despotic heel,\nGo up against the sun on slanting keel,\nAs men that crawled like ants like falcons soar.\n\nHow great those altitudes they do not know\nWho see far upward their eternal snow,\nAnd dream to join the eagles of their dome.\nO valiant hearts, O you that take such wings\nAbove the humble heritage of things\nRemember that the earth at last is home!"}
