{"subject": "Song  Ii", "text": "Though now it were madness to cherish \nThe dream that enchained us so long, \nYet shall it not utterly perish, \nFor thou hast embalmed it in song: \nIts story's exquisite revealing \nShall live on the lips of the young; \nEach change of its passionate feeling \nBe gayly or mournfully sung. \n\nLike honey-dew dropping on blossoms, \nOn hearts thy sweet numbers shall fall; \nThy lays shall thrill desolate bosoms, \nAnd tenderest visions recall; \nNow wild, like the rapturous greeting \nThat song-birds send down from above; \nNow sad, like the tremulous beating \nOf hearts that are breaking with love."}
