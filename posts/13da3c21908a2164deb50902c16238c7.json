{"subject": "His Mistress To Him At His Farewell", "text": "You may vow I'll not forget\nTo pay the debt\nWhich to thy memory stands as due\nAs faith can seal it you.\n--Take then tribute of my tears;\nSo long as I have fears\nTo prompt me, I shall ever\nLanguish and look, but thy return see never.\nOh then to lessen my despair,\nPrint thy lips into(the air,\nSo by this\nMeans, I may kiss thy kiss,\nWhenas some kind\nWind\nShall hither waft it:--And, in lieu,\nMy lips shall send a thousand back to you."}
