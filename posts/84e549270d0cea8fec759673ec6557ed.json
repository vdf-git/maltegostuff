{"subject": "Italy", "text": "There is a country in my mind,\n    Lovelier than a poet blind\n    Could dream of, who had never known\n    This world of drought and dust and stone\n    In all its ugliness: a place\n    Full of an all but human grace;\n    Whose dells retain the printed form\n    Of heavenly sleep, and seem yet warm\n    From some pure body newly risen;\n    Where matter is no more a prison,\n    But freedom for the soul to know\n    Its native beauty. For things glow\n    There with an inward truth and are\n    All fire and colour like a star.\n    And in that land are domes and towers\n    That hang as light and bright as flowers\n    Upon the sky, and seem a birth\n    Rather of air than solid earth.\n\n    Sometimes I dream that walking there\n    In the green shade, all unaware\n    At a new turn of the golden glade,\n    I shall see her, and as though afraid\n    Shall halt a moment and almost fall\n    For passing faintness, like a man\n    Who feels the sudden spirit of Pan\n    Brimming his narrow soul with all\n    The illimitable world. And she,\n    Turning her head, will let me see\n    The first sharp dawn of her surprise\n    Turning to welcome in her eyes.\n    And I shall come and take my lover\n    And looking on her re-discover\n    All her beauty:- her dark hair\n    And the little ears beneath it, where\n    Roses of lucid shadow sleep;\n    Her brooding mouth, and in the deep\n    Wells of her eyes reflected stars ...\n\n    Oh, the imperishable things\n    That hands and lips as well as words\n    Shall speak! Oh movement of white wings,\n    Oh wheeling galaxies of birds ...!"}
