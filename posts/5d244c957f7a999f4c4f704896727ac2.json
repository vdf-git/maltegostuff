{"subject": "The Unappeasable Host", "text": "THE Danaan children laugh, in cradles of wrought gold,\nAnd clap their hands together, and half close their eyes,\nFor they will ride the North when the ger-eagle flies,\nWith heavy whitening wings, and a heart fallen cold:\nI kiss my wailing child and press it to my breast,\nAnd hear the narrow graves calling my child and me.\nDesolate winds that cry over the wandering sea;\nDesolate winds that hover in the flaming West;\nDesolate winds that beat the doors of Heaven, and beat\nThe doors of Hell and blow there many a whimpering ghost;\nO heart the winds have shaken, the unappeasable host\nIs comelier than candles at Mother Mary's feet."}
