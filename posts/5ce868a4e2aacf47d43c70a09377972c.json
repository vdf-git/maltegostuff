Everyone breathing\nfor now, in and out, all night.\n\nThese sad things, they have to be.\nI go into the kitchen thinking to sweeten myself.\n\nBoiled eggs won't do a thing.\nOysters. Lysol. Peanut butter. Gin.\n\nBig babyface, getting fed.\nI am twenty. I am thirty. I am forty years old.\n\nA friend said Listen,\nyou have to try to calm down."}
