{"subject": "Dark Pools", "text": "The idea is to cover up what may be profitable, to cloak;\nresulting in a slow and heavy smog that smooches\nclose around the prize. Thus, we have these pools;\ntheir beds of smoothed obsidian. Is it here to which\nthe goldbugs crawl that we so love to chase?\n\nI am convinced. I must conclude. I know,\nby flipping up a single carapace (the beetle part cut out),\ninverted, still it retains that iridescent sheen;\nits fault-lines already founded. It could be\n\na bowl: the gap between its wings well-grouted; or, upended,\na simple hill: climbed for the sake of it being there to climb.\nYet, if upended once more, will offer of itself \nsome gloomy presence nestled neatly in its hollow cup.\n\nIts name of pool defines its emptiness, just as the pupil\nis but the black hole through which all light poured in\nis quickly deadened, can't escape; so\nevery risk that drips into these pools is dwindled, is\nleached out, through yet further pin-pricks, hidden in the base.\n\nTranslated by J.O.
