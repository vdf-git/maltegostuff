{"subject": "Roger Lane", "text": "When the sky is dark and gray,  \nand the rain comes down in the day.  \nI just walk in the rain.  \nGet the blue Raindrops blues  My father has never told me,  \nwhen I walk in the rain.  \nI\u2019ll get the blue rain drops blues.  Then I\u2019ll hear that whistle of that train  \ngoing down the track in the rain  \nI\u2019ll be walking down Roger Lane \nwith the Blue Raindrops blues  When I get home and let the air out  \nmy shoes. She will hold me and  \nkiss and I\u2019ll forget the blues  But when the skies are dark and gray  \nI\u2019ll be walking in the rain  \nI\u2019ll have the Blue Raindrops blues."}
