{"subject": "The Foggy Dew", "text": "A splendid place is London, with golden store, \nFor them that have the heart and hope and youth galore; \nBut mournful are its streets to me, I tell you true, \nFor I'm longing sore for Ireland in the foggy dew. \n\nThe sun he shines all day here, so fierce and fine, \nWith never a wisp of mist at all to dim his shine;\nThe sun he shines all day here from skies of blue: \nHe hides his face in Ireland in the foggy dew. \n\nThe maids go out to milking in the pastures gray, \nThe sky is green and golden at dawn of the day; \nAnd in the deep-drenched meadows the hay lies new, \nAnd the corn is turning yellow in the foggy dew. \n\nMavrone ! if I might feel now the dew on my face, \nAnd the wind from the mountains in that remembered place, \nI'd give the wealth of London, if mine it were to do, \nAnd I'd travel home to Ireland and the foggy dew."}
