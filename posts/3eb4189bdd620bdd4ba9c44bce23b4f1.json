{"subject": "A Toast To Africa", "text": "Christmas, 1920\n\nFrom a goblet of rarest and richest red gold,\nEncrusted with jewels of value untold,\nAll flowing and glowing with nectar of wine,\nDistilled from the spirits of souls sweet and fine\nAs these sons and daughters whose deeds I rehearse,\nWith zeal all-consuming, though halting my verse--\nI drink to my Race on this epochal morn,\nRemembering the Christ-child who came lowly-born,--\nWas despised, crucified and rejected of men,\nBut now to whom honor and glory--Amen!"}
