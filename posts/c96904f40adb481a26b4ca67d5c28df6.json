Your \nface is very different when you don't smile, when \nyou negate sharply and perforate. Stellar wind-whistles\nthat whistle-blow and things seldom end well for the mouth behind, \nit will never again smile. Yet it has to move near the sting color \nand the poison, the sun. \n\nTranslation: Johannes G\u00f6ransson"}
