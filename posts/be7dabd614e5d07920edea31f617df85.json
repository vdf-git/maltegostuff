{"subject": "3", "text": "Yet is there hope, then Love but play thy part,\nRemember well thy selfe, and think on me;\nShine in those eyes which conquer'd have my heart,\nAnd see if mine, be slacke to answer thee.\nLodge in that breast, and pitty mooving see,\nFor flames which in mine burne in truest smart,\nExciling thoughts, that touch Inconstancy,\nOr those which waste not in the constant Art,\nWatch but my sleepe, if I take any rest,\nFor thought of you, my spirit so distrest,\nAs, pale and famish'd, I for mercy cry.\nWill you your servant leave: thinke but on this,\nWho weares Love's Crowne, must not doe so amisse\nBut seeke their good, who on thy force do lye."}
