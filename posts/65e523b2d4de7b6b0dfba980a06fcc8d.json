{"subject": "The Salzburg Chimes.", "text": "Sweetly float o'er town and tower\nStrains that mark the dawning hour;\nSoothing, as it glides along,\nYon fair stream with tinkling song;\nOver vineyard, rock, and wood,\nAnd where ancient bastion stood,\nHeralds now of peaceful times,\nSweetly float the Salzburg chimes.\n\nOnce again--from this green hill\nEcho lets no leaf be still;\nOnce again--the Salza's breast\nGives the welling sounds no rest:\nDistant in the spreading plain\nMount and tower take up the strain,\nTill in yonder Alpine climes\nHerdsmen catch the Salzburg chimes.\n\nYet once again--the merry merry child\nDances to the melody with gambols wild:\nYet once more--the sentry stern\nPaces to the time at every turn:\nE'en the sick on painful bed\nLifts in hope his weary head,\nAnd hoary elders bless the times\nWhen first they heard the Salzburg chimes.\n\nYet once more--ere noonday rise,\nPart our steps for other skies:\nYet once more--in memory's ear\nStill shall sound that music clear:\nAnd in England's homes of light,\nWhen the cheerful hearth is bright,\nWill we, in far distant climes,\nWake the slumbering Salzburg chimes."}
