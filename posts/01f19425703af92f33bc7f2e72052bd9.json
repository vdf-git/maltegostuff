{"subject": "At the Family Court", "text": "At the Family Court\nThe lift wouldn't work.\nSo they walked up \nFour flights\nOf stairs and passed\nOn the fourth landing \nTwo toilets, one marked,\nFor Judges Only, and one,\nFor Others. They used\nThe first though.\nBut no one charged\nThem with contempt of court. \nLater, they sat in the hail\nWith some 20 others,\nPeople come together \nTo be separated.\nThe four fans in the hall\nBig as windmills\nBreezed past\nTheir several lives.\nLate in the noon\nAn attendant \nCalled out their names\nAnd led them into a hall\nWhere the judge \nThey met in the toilet said\nThey were no longer\nMan and wife."}
