{"subject": "More With Us Than With Them", "text": "Alas! Elisha's servant cried,\nWhen he the Syrian army spied,\nBut he was soon released from care,\nIn answer to the prophet's prayer. \n\nStraitway he saw, with other eyes,\nA greater army from the skies;\nA fiery guard around the hill,\nThus are the saints preserved still. \n\nWhen Satan and his host appear,\nLike him of old, I faint and fear;\nLike him, by faith, with joy I see,\nA greater host engaged for me. \n\nThe saints espouse my cause by prayer,\nThe angels make my soul their care;\nMine is the promise sealed with blood,\nAnd Jesus lives to make it good."}
