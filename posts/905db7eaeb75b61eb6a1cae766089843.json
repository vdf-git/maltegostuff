{"subject": "Three Songs Of Shattering", "text": "I\n\nThe first rose on my rose-tree\n   Budded, bloomed, and shattered,\nDuring sad days when to me\n          Nothing mattered.\n\nGrief of grief has drained me clean;\n   Still it seems a pity\nNo one saw,\u2014it must have been\n          Very pretty.\n\n           II\n\nLet the little birds sing;\n   Let the little lambs play;\nSpring is here; and so 'tis spring;\u2014\n   But not in the old way!\n\nI recall a place\n   Where a plum-tree grew;\nThere you lifted up your face,\n   And blossoms covered you.\n\nIf the little birds sing,\n   And the little lambs play,\nSpring is here; and so 'tis spring\u2014\n   But not in the old way!\n\n           III\n\nAll the dog-wood blossoms are underneath the tree!\n   Ere spring was going\u2014ah, spring is gone!\nAnd there comes no summer to the like of you and me,\u2014\n   Blossom time is early, but no fruit sets on.\n\nAll the dog-wood blossoms are underneath the tree,\n   Browned at the edges, turned in a day;\nAnd I would with all my heart they trimmed a mound for me,\n   And weeds were tall on all the paths that led that way!"}
