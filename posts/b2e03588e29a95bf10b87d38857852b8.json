{"subject": "Hands!", "text": "Hands! Gentle Hands! \nWhen the Field at covert stands, \nWhen your four-rear-old is sweating, \nFoamed and fidgety and fretting \nAs a stray hound jumps the netting - \nYou can steady him and soothe him with your Hands!\nHands! Clever Hands! \nWhen your tiring hunter lands \nOver wall or ditch or double \nWith his noseband in the stubble, \nThat's the moment you're in trouble \nIf you have not got the saving gift of Hands! \nHands! Steady Hands! \nWhen your reins seem useless bands, \nWith a mad brute going faster \nAnd a toss-up which is master, \nYou may still avoid disaster \nIf Providence has given to you Hands!\nHands! Talking Hands! \nAt the fence below the Stands, \nWhen you call on him to lead them, \nThat's the moment when you need them, \nThat's the time a horse will heed them \nAs you bring him up and help him with your Hands!\nHands! Horseman's Hands! \nWhen the stooping fairy stands \nAt the cradle of a baby, \nShe has richer gifts, it may be, \nBut she never brought a better one than Hands!"}
