{"subject": "Sonnet Cliii", "text": "Cupid laid by his brand, and fell asleep:\n     A maid of Dian's this advantage found,\n     And his love-kindling fire did quickly steep\n     In a cold valley-fountain of that ground;\n     Which borrow'd from this holy fire of Love\n     A dateless lively heat, still to endure,\n     And grew a seething bath, which yet men prove\n     Against strange maladies a sovereign cure.\n     But at my mistress' eye Love's brand new-fired,\n     The boy for trial needs would touch my breast;\n     I, sick withal, the help of bath desired,\n     And thither hied, a sad distemper'd guest,\n     But found no cure: the bath for my help lies\n     Where Cupid got new fire--my mistress' eyes."}
