{"subject": "To A Cricket", "text": "Voice of summer, keen and shrill,\nChirping round my winter fire,\nOf thy song I never tire,\nWeary others as they will,\nFor thy song with summer's filled -\nFilled with sunshine, filled with June;\nFirelight echo of that noon\nHeard in fields when all is stilled\nIn the golden light of May,\nBringing scents of new-mown hay,\nBees, and birds, and flowers away,\nPrithee, haunt my fireside still,\nVoice of summer, keen and shrill."}
