{"subject": "Jeremiah Xvii. 9.", "text": "The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked.\nTHE ocean wave at morn is calm, \nAbove it glows the quiet sky, \nAnd gentle winds, like living balm, \nUpon its surface sigh; \nAnd lo! the ship, in power and pride, \nDoth o'er the circling waters slowly ride. \n\nBut shall no tempest ever come? \nShall it seem always calm as now? \nAlas! full many a cloud of gloom \nMust shadow heaven's bright brow; \nAnd waves and foam shall rudely chafe \nAround yon barque, that seems to sail so safe. \n\nDeceitful calm! deceitful sea! \nOh! in all nature's varied range, \nIs there a thing so false as thee? \nSo full of fickle change? \nOh very false thy waters are,\u2014 \nOne thing on earth is more deceitful far; \n\nFor should we not believe the word \nOur God hath said\u2014the sadly true! \nHave not our own wild passions stirred \nIts wayward mazes through? \nWho hath not interest and part \nIn that strange, restless thing, the human heart? \n\nOh! most deceitful \u2014 full of sin! \nCalm, calm thy fiery throb and thrill; \nCurb the strong torrents loosed within: \nOh! human heart, be still! \nAlas! thou'rt like the roving wind, \nThat mortal power hath found no spell to bind. \n\nPray for the shower of heavenly dew, \nTo cool thy desert parched domain; \nPray that God's Spirit will renew \nThat holy gift again; \nThat there His words, fast taking root, \nMay bring forth plenteously celestial fruit. \n\nOh Saviour! though thy quiet breast \nFrom human failings was apart, \nBorest Thou not there, although at rest, \nThe burden of a heart? \nThough pure and holy, day by day \nDidst thou not feel the weight of human clay? \n\nOur's, stained with grief, and fear, and crime, \nHelp us in mercy still to bear; \nAnd in thine own most blessed time, \nRelieve us of our care: \nTeach the poor heart to sin no more, \nE'en ere the 'burden of the flesh' is o'er."}
