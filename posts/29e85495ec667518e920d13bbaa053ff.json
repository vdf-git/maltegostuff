{"subject": "Ile A L'Autre Cote De L'Eau", "text": "Your silver eyes\nHas two faces with reflection\n\nOne is like autumn leaves\nOr brown sepia photographs\nAnd seem only to dull in death\nAnd sadness of what once was...\n\nThe other eye sparkles\nDances magic with all the history of    \nGaul bubbling out\nAnd swims in warm southern beaches\nUnder a boiling smile.\nSometimes you close one eye, \nSometimes the other, \nBut never do you stare at me\nUnblinking across this horizon\nI have etched throughout my long years"}
