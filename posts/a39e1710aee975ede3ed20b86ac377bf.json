{"subject": "A New Year's Plaint", "text": "In words like weeds, I'll wrap me o'er,\nLike coarsest clothes against the cold;\nBut that large grief which these enfold\nIs given in outline and no more.\n--TENNYSON.\n\nThe bells that lift their yawning throats\nAnd lolling tongues with wrangling cries\nFlung up in harsh, discordant notes,\nAs though in anger, at the skies,--\nAre filled with echoings replete,\nWith purest tinkles of delight--\nSo I would have a something sweet\nRing in the song I sing to-night.\n\nAs when a blotch of ugly guise\nOn some poor artist's naked floor\nBecomes a picture in his eyes,\nAnd he forgets that he is poor,--\nSo I look out upon the night,\nThat ushers in the dawning year,\nAnd in a vacant blur of light\nI see these fantasies appear.\n\nI see a home whose windows gleam\nLike facets of a mighty gem\nThat some poor king's distorted dream\nHas fastened in his diadem.\nAnd I behold a throng that reels\nIn revelry of dance and mirth,\nWith hearts of love beneath their heels,\nAnd in their bosoms hearts of earth.\n\nO Luxury, as false and grand\nAs in the mystic tales of old,\nWhen genii answered man's command,\nAnd built of nothing halls of gold!\nO Banquet, bright with pallid jets,\nAnd tropic blooms, and vases caught\nIn palms of naked statuettes,\nYe can not color as ye ought!\n\nFor, crouching in the storm without,\nI see the figure of a child,\nIn little ragged roundabout,\nWho stares with eyes that never smiled--\nAnd he, in fancy can but taste\nThe dainties of the kingly fare,\nAnd pick the crumbs that go to waste\nWhere none have learned to kneel in prayer.\n\nGo, Pride, and throw your goblet down--\nThe 'merry greeting' best appears\nOn loving lips that never drown\nIts worth but in the wine of tears;\nGo, close your coffers like your hearts,\nAnd shut your hearts against the poor,\nGo, strut through all your pretty parts\nBut take the 'Welcome' from your door."}
