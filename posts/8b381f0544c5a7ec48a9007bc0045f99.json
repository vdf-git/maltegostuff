{"subject": "A True Tale", "text": "A mother, who vast Pleasure finds\nIn modelling her Childrens Minds;\nWith whom, in exquisite Delight,\nShe passes many a Winter Night;\nMingles in ev'ry Play, to find\nWhat Byass Nature gave the Mind;\nResolving thence to take her Aim,\nTo guide them to the Realms of Fame;\nAnd wisely make those Realms their Way\nTo Regions of eternal Day;\nEach boist'rous Passion to controul,\nAnd early humanize the Soul;\nIn simple Tales, beside the Fire,\nThe noblest Notions would inspire:\nHer Children, conscious of her Care,\nTransported, hung around her Chair.\n\nOf Scripture--Heroes she would tell,\nWhose Names they lisp'd, ere they could spell:\nThe Mother then, delighted, smiles;\nAnd shews the Story on the Tiles.\n\nAt other Times, her Themes would be\nThe Sages of Antiquity;\nWho left immortal Names behind,\nBy proving Blessings to their Kind.\nAgain, she takes another Scope,\nAnd tells of Addison, and Pope.\n\nStudious to let her Children know\nThe various Turns of Things below;--\nHow Virtue here was oft oppress'd,\nTo shine more glorious with the Bless'd;\nTold Tully's and the Gracchi's Doom,\nThe Patriots, and the Pride of Rome.\nThen bless'd the Drapier's happier Fate,\nWho sav'd, and lives to guard the State.\n\nSome Comedies gave great Delight,\nAnd entertain'd them many a Night:\nOthers could no Admittance find,\nForbid, as Poison to the Mind:\nThose Authors Wit and Sense, said she,\nBut heighten their Impiety.\n\nThis happy Mother met, one Day,\nThe Book of Fables, writ by Gay;\nAnd told her Children, Here's a Treasure,\nA Fund of Wisdom, and of Pleasure!\nSuch Morals, and so finely writ;\nSuch Decency, good Sense, and Wit!\nWell has the Poet found the Art,\nTo raise the Mind, and mend the Heart.\n\nHer fav'rite Son the Volume seiz'd;\nAnd, as he read, seem'd highly pleas'd;\nMade such Reflections ev'ry Page;\nThe Mother thought above his Age;\nDelighted read, but scarce was able\nTo finish the concluding Fable.\n\nWhat ails my Child? the Mother cries:\nWhose Sorrows now have fill'd your Eyes?\nO dear Mamma, can he want Friends,\nWho writes for such exalted Ends?\nO base, degen'rate human Kind!\nHad I a Fortune to my Mind,\nShould Gay complain? But now, alas!\nThro' what a World am I to pass?\nWhere Friendship is an empty Name,\nAnd Merit scarcely paid in Fame?\n\nResolv'd to lull his Woes to Rest,\nShe tells him, He should hope the best:\nThis has been yet Gay's Case, I own;\nBut now his Merit's amply known.\nContent that tender Heart of thine:\nHe'll be the Care of Caroline.\nWho thus instructs the royal Race,\nMust have a Pension, or a Place.\n\nMamma, if you were Queen, says he,\nAnd such a Book were writ for me,\nI find 'tis so much to your Taste,\nThat Gay would keep his Coach at least.\n\nMy Son, what you suppose, is true:\nI see its Excellence in you.\nPoets who write to mend the Mind,\nA royal Recompence should find.\nBut I am barr'd by Fortune's Frowns,\nFrom the best Privilege of Crowns;\nThe glorious, godlike Pow'r to bless,\nAnd raise up Merit in Distress.\n\nBut, dear Mamma, I long to know,\nWere you the Queen, what you'd bestow.\n\nWhat I'd bestow, says she, my Dear?\nAt least, a thousand Pounds a Year."}
