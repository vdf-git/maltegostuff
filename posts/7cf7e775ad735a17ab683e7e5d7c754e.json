{"subject": "Portrait Of My Father As A Young Man", "text": "In the eyes: dream. The brow as if it could feel\nsomething far off. Around the lips, a great\nfreshness--seductive, though there is no smile.\nUnder the rows of ornamental braid\non the slim Imperial officer's uniform:\nthe saber's basket-hilt. Both hands stay\nfolded upon it, going nowhere, calm\nand now almost invisible, as if they\nwere the first to grasp the distance and dissolve.\nAnd all the rest so curtained within itself,\nso cloudy, that I cannot understand\nthis figure as it fades into the background--.\n\nOh quickly disappearing photograph\nin my more slowly disappearing hand."}
