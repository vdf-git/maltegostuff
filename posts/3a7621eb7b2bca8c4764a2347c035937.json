{"subject": "Inheritance", "text": "THERE lived a man who raised his hand and said,\n'I will be great!'\nAnd through a long, long life he bravely knocked\nAt Fame's closed gate.\n\nA son he left who, like his sire, strove\nHigh place to win;--\nWorn out, he died and, dying, left no trace\nThat he had been.\n\nHe also left a son, who, without care\nOr planning how,\nBore the fair letters of a deathless fame\nUpon his brow.\n\n'Behold a genius, filled with fire divine!'\nThe people cried;\nNot knowing that to make him what he was\nTwo men had died."}
