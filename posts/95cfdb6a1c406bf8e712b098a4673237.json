{"subject": "Heaven's Loft Illusions", "text": "Burning fragrant joss sticks\n Stuck in a dark bark niche\n Destiny can be had ad nauseam\n Forbearance with all its malum\n Pondering with sleight old nick\n Hoping somehow for no switch\n Job's comforter will interpel\n A tormentor in its hell\n To see miracles in the light\n Life upside down in day of night\n Repace the image of body\n Mind now not so haughty\n Shifted shadow oh so flighty\n Known to trek of stars delightly\n Some distant time prior Kantian\n Abort aloft yore clay Pre-Cambrian\n United with strength in all its thoughts\n Too late remembered set not naught\n Souls all malcontent breakthrough anew\n Judgement cloud portends a Thanatos view"}
