{"subject": "Cumberland Fells", "text": "Dark ebony in the morning light\n Cloud screened with swirls of misty white\n In day, cool green with purple patched\n Stone walls, few buildings, never thatched\n Deep azure while the evening stays\n Pale shadow by the starlight rays. \n Odalisque The jewel in her navel is a beacon of delight\n Promising the passions of the warmly perfumed night\n Her destiny, her purpose, her mind and body too\n Are formed and framed and fashioned to be a dream come true\n\n Exotic form and features, the dark black starry eyes\n Skin so smooth and shaven, the gleaming ivory thighs\n The clinging multi coloured effervescent silken robe\n The gentle practised fingers, well trained to touch and probe. \n Incantation Eye of toad and tail of newt\n Heart of frog and Yew Tree fruit\n Boil and mix and stir in meat\n Gathered from the Gallows feet.\n\n Pour Water from the Magic Well\n Stir and stir and cast your Spell\n Demons Witches Elves and Sprites\n Shall serve your will ten days and nights."}
