{"subject": "The Loving Tree", "text": "Three women walked upon a road,\nAnd the first said airily,\n\u201cOf all the trees in all the world\nWhich is the loving tree?\u201d\n\nThe second said, \u201cMy eyes have seen\nNo tree that is not fair;\nBut the Orange tree is the sweetest tree,\nThe loving blood is there.\u201d\n\nAnd the third said, \u201cIn the green time\nI knew a loving tree\nThat gave a drink of the blood-red milk,\nIt was the Mulberry.\u201d\n\nThen the first one said, \u201cOf all the trees\nNo sweetest can I name;\nAsk her who yonder slowly comes\u2014\nThat woman lean and lame.\u201d\n\nGrief like a hideous suckling hung\nAlong her hollow breast,\nPain was upon her as she walked,\nAnd as she stooped to rest.\n\n\u201cWhy will you question so?\u201d she said,\n\u201cIs it to mock at me?\nFor how should I, who walk in Hell,\nKnow of a loving tree?\n\n\u201cMy eyes are not as woman's eyes,\nThey hope not east or west:\nDull Famine my bed-mate is,\nAnd Loneliness my guest.\n\n\u201c 'Tis not the most delicious flower\nThat leaves the scent of Spring,\nNor is it yet the brightest bird\nThat loads his heart to sing.\n\n\u201cA tree may dance in the white weather\nOr dream in a blue gown,\nA tree may sing as a sweetheart\nTo bid the stars come down:\n\n\u201cSome trees are slim and lovable\nAnd some are sleek and strong,\nBut the tree that has the cripple's heart\nWill know the cripple's song.\n\n\u201cThe sweetest death is the red death\nThat comes up nakedly,\nAnd the tree that has the foiled heart\nIt is the loving tree.\n\n\u201cWhile ever lip shall seek for lip,\nWhile ever light shall fall,\nThe tree that has the ruined heart\nIs tenderest of all.\n\n\u201cOh, ye may have your men to kiss,\nAnd children warm to hold,\nBut the heart that had the hottest love\nWas never yet consoled.\u201d\n\nThe women three walked on their way,\nTheir shamed eyes could see\nHow well the tree with the foiled heart\nIs still the loving tree."}
