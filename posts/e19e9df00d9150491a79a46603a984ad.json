{"subject": "To The Additional Examiner For 1875", "text": "Queen Cram went straying\nWhere Tait was swaying,\nIn just hands weighing,\nWith care immense,\nDry proofs made pleasant\nBy Routh or Besant\nFor one who hasn\u2019t\nGot too much sense.\nNor marked how, quicker\nThan mounts the liquor\nIn brains made thicker\nBy College beer,\nThe murderous maiden,\nMistake, walks laden\nWith tips forgotten and slips so queer.\n\nHow, like a spider,\nShe still spreads wider,\nO\u2019er bookwork, rider,\nAnd problem too,\nHer flimsy curtain\nOf terms uncertain,\nTill all seems dirt in\nThe marker\u2019s view.\nFor if Cram were not,\nWhich markers spare not,\nWise men would care not\nTo pluck too soon,\nSeeing all life\u2019s season\nOf budding reason\nFinds good stiff work for a wooden spoon.\n\nAs Tait sat joking,\nAnd marked while smoking,\nStill slyly poking\nWhere jests might hit,\nShe came, soft-gliding,\nHer false face hiding,\nRich food providing\nFor Tait\u2019s sharp wit.\nThrough symbols tangled,\nThe Wranglers wrangled\nLike sweet bells jangled\nAnd out of tune.\nFor though their music\nWould soon make you sick\nThe tides they measure and guide the moon.\n\nCram found no cover\nWherein to hover,\nFor still above her\nTait held his pen,\nWhich, onward creeping,\nMight find her sleeping,\nBut left her weeping\nO\u2019er ruined men.\nFor, like a blister,\nMistake, Cram\u2019s sister,\nWould wring and twist her\nIn awkward ways,\nTill all the knowledge\nAcquired at College\nHad passed from thought(49) in the last six days."}
