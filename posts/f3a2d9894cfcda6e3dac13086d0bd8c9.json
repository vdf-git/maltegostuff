{"subject": "Come Unto Me", "text": "Come unto me, the Master says:-\nBut how? I am not good;\nNo thankful song my heart will raise,\nNor even wish it could.\n\nI am not sorry for the past,\nNor able not to sin;\nThe weary strife would ever last\nIf once I should begin!\n\nHast thou no burden then to bear?\nNo action to repent?\nIs all around so very fair?\nIs thy heart quite content?\n\nHast thou no sickness in thy soul?\nNo labour to endure?\nThen go in peace, for thou art whole;\nThou needest not his cure.\n\nAh, mock me not! I often sigh;\nI have a nameless grief,\nA faint sad pain-but such that I\nCan look for no relief.\n\nCome, come to him who made thy heart;\nCome weary and oppressed;\nTo come to Jesus is thy part,\nHis part to give thee rest.\n\nNew grief, new hope he will bestow,\nThy grief and pain to quell;\nInto thy heart himself will go,\nAnd that will make thee well."}
