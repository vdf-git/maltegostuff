{"subject": "Songs Of The Winter Days", "text": "I.\n\nThe sky has turned its heart away,\nThe earth its sorrow found;\nThe daisies turn from childhood's play,\nAnd creep into the ground.\n\nThe earth is black and cold and hard;\nThin films of dry white ice,\nAcross the rugged wheel-tracks barred,\nThe children's feet entice.\n\nDark flows the stream, as if it mourned\nThe winter in the land;\nWith idle icicles adorned,\nThat mill-wheel soon will stand.\n\nBut, friends, to say 'tis cold, and part,\nIs to let in the cold;\nWe'll make a summer of the heart,\nAnd laugh at winter old.\nII.\n\nWith vague dead gleam the morning white\nComes through the window-panes;\nThe clouds have fallen all the night,\nWithout the noise of rains.\n\nAs of departing, unseen ghost,\nFootprints go from the door;\nThe man himself must long be lost\nWho left those footprints hoar!\n\nYet follow thou; tread down the snow;\nLeave all the road behind;\nHeed not the winds that steely blow,\nHeed not the sky unkind;\n\nFor though the glittering air grow dark,\nThe snow will shine till morn;\nAnd long ere then one dear home-spark\nWill winter laugh to scorn.\n\nIII.\n\nOh wildly wild the roaring blast\nTorments the fallen snow!\nThe wintry storms are up at last,\nAnd care not how they go!\n\nIn foam-like wreaths the water hoar,\nRapt whistling in the air,\nGleams through the dismal twilight frore;\nA region in despair,\n\nA spectral ocean lies outside,\nTorn by a tempest dark;\nIts ghostly billows, dim descried,\nLeap on my stranded bark.\n\nDeath-sheeted figures, long and white,\nRave driving through the spray;\nOr, bosomed in the ghastly night,\nShriek doom-cries far away.\nIV.\n\nA morning clear, with frosty light\nFrom sunbeams late and low;\nThey shine upon the snow so white,\nAnd shine back from the snow.\n\nDown tusks of ice one drop will go,\nNor fall: at sunny noon\n'Twill hang a diamond-fade, and grow\nAn opal for the moon.\n\nAnd when the bright sad sun is low\nBehind the mountain-dome,\nA twilight wind will come and blow\nAround the children's home,\n\nAnd puff and waft the powdery snow,\nAs feet unseen did pass;\nWhile, waiting in its bed below,\nGreen lies the summer grass."}
