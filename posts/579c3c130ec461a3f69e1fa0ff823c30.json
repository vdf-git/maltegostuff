{"subject": "Circle And Square", "text": "\u2018I give you half of me; \nNo more, lest I should make \nA ground for perjury. \nFor your sake, for my sake, \nHalf will you take?\u2019 \n\n\u2018Half I\u2019ll not take nor give, \nFor he who gives gives all. \nBy halves you cannot live; \nThen let the barrier fall, \nIn one circle have all.\u2019 \n\n\u201cA wise and ancient scorner \nSaid to me once: Beware \nThe road that has no corner \nWhere you can linger and stare. \nChoose the square. \n\n\u2018And let the circle run \nIts dull and fevered race. \nYou, my dear, are one; \nShow your soul in your face; \nMaintain your place. \n\n\u2018Give, but have something to give. \nNo man can want you all. \nLive, and learn to live. \nWhen all the barriers fall \nYou are nothing at all.\u2019"}
