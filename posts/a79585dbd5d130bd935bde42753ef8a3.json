{"subject": "The River", "text": "In my first sleep\nI came to the river\nAnd looked down\nThrough the clear water -\nOnly in dream\nWater so pure,\nLaced and undulant\nLines of flow\nOn its rocky bed\nWater of life\nStreaming for ever.\n\nA house was there\nBeside the river\nAnd I, arrived,\nAn expected guest \nAbout to explore\nOld gardens and libraries -\nBut the car was waiting\nTo drive me away.\n\nOne last look\nInto that bright stream -\nTrout there were\nAnd clear on the bottom\nMonster form\nOf the great crayfish\nThat crawls to the moon.\nOn its rocky bed\nLiving water\nIn whorls and ripples\nFlowing unbended.\n\nThere was the car\nTo drive me away.\nWe crossed the river\nOf living water - \nI might not stay,\nBut must return\nBy the road too short\nTo the waiting day.\n\nIn my second dream\nPure I was and free\nBy the rapid stream,\nMy crystal house the sky,\nThe pure crystalline sky.\n\nInto the stream I flung\nA bottle of clear glass\nThat twirled and tossed and spun\nIn the water's race\nFlashing the morning sun.\n\nDown that swift river\nI saw it borne away,\nMy empty crystal form,\nExultant saw it caught\nInto the current's spin,\nThe flashing water's run."}
