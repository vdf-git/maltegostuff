{"subject": "Amaryllis", "text": "A flower needs to be this size\nto conceal the winter window,\nand this color, the red\nof a Fiat with the top down,\nto impress us, dull as we've grown.\n\nMonths ago the gigantic onion of a bulb\nhalf above the soil\nstuck out its green tongue\nand slowly, day by day,\nthe flower itself entered our world,\n\nclosed, like hands that captured a moth,\nthen open, as eyes open,\nand the amaryllis, seeing us,\nwas somehow undiscouraged.\nIt stands before us now\n\nas we eat our soup;\nyou pour a little of your drinking water\ninto its saucer, and a few crumbs\nof fragrant earth fall\nonto the tabletop."}
