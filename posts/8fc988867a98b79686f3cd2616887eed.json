{"subject": "First Snow", "text": "This is the first soft snow\nThat tiptoes up to your door\nAs you sit by the fire and sew,\nThat sifts through a crack in the floor\nAnd covers your hair with hoar.\nThis is the stiffening wound\nBurning the heart of a deer\nChased by a moon-white hound,\nThis is the hunt, and the queer\nSick beating of feet that fear.\nThis is the crisp despair\nLying close to the marrow,\nFallen out of the air\nLike frost on the narrow\nBone of a shot sparrow.\nThis is the love that will seize\nSavagely onto your mind\nAnd do whatever he please,\nThis the despair, and a moon-blind\nHound you never bind."}
