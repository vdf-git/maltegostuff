{"subject": "One Way Of Love", "text": ".\n\nAll June I bound the rose in sheaves. \nNow, rose by rose, I strip the leaves\nAnd strew them where Pauline may pass.\nShe will not turn aside? Alas!\nLet them lie. Suppose they die?\nThe chance was they might take her eye.\n\n\tII.\n\nHow many a month I strove to suit\nThese stubborn fingers to the lute!\nTo-day I venture all I know.\nShe will not hear my music? So!\nBreak the string; fold music's wing:\nSuppose Pauline had bade me sing!\n\n\tIII.\n\nMy whole life long I learned to love.\nThis hour my utmost art I prove\nAnd speak my passion---heaven or hell?\nShe will not give me heaven?  'Tis well!\nLose who may---I still can say,\nThose who win heaven, blest are they!"}
