{"subject": "The White Lilies", "text": "As a man and woman make\na garden between them like\na bed of stars, here\nthey linger in the summer evening\nand the evening turns\ncold with their terror: it\ncould all end, it is capable\nof devastation. All, all\ncan be lost, through scented air\nthe narrow columns\nuselessly rising, and beyond,\na churning sea of poppies--\n\nHush, beloved.  It doesn't matter to me\nhow many summers I live to return:\nthis one summer we have entered eternity.\nI felt your two hands\nbury me to release its splendor."}
