{"subject": "Prosperity Of The Godless", "text": "Strange is it that the godless, who have sprung\nFrom evil-doers, should fare prosperously,\nWhile good men, born of noble stock, should be\nBy adverse fortune vexed. It was ill done\nFor the Gods thus to order lives of men.\nWhat ought to be is this, that godly souls\nShould from the Gods gain some clear recompense,\nAnd the unjust pay some clear penalty;\nSo none would prosper who are base of soul."}
