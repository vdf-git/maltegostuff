{"subject": "Fool", "text": "O Fool, try to carry thyself upon thy own shoulders! \nO beggar, to come beg at thy own door! \n\nLeave all thy burdens on his hands who can bear all, \nand never look behind in regret. \n\nThy desire at once puts out the light from the lamp it touches with its breath. \nIt is unholy---take not thy gifts through its unclean hands. \nAccept only what is offered by sacred love."}
