{"subject": "A Dialogue", "text": "Man. SWEETEST Saviour, if my soul \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Were but worth the having, \nQuickly should I then control \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Any thought of waving. \nBut when all my care and pains \nCannot give the name of gains \nTo Thy wretch so full of stains, \nWhat delight or hope remains? \n\nSaviour. What, child, is the balance thine, \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thine the poise and measure? \nIf I say, 'Thou shalt be Mine,' \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finger not My treasure. \nWhat the gains in having thee \nDo amount to, only He \nWho for man was sold can see; \nThat transferr'd th' accounts to Me. \n\nMan. But as I can see no merit \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Leading to this favour, \nSo the way to fit me for it \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Is beyond my savour. \nAs the reason, then, is Thine, \nSo the way is none of mine; \nI disclaim the whole design; \nSin disclaims and I resign. \n\nSaviour. That is all: if that I could \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Get without repining; \nAnd My clay, My creature, would \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Follow My resigning; \nThat as I did freely part \nWith My glory and desert, \nLeft all joys to feel all smart---- \n\nMan. Ah, no more! Thou break'st my heart!"}
