{"subject": "The Doll's Wooing", "text": "The little French doll was a dear little doll\nTricked out in the sweetest of dresses;\nHer eyes were of hue\nA most delicate blue\nAnd dark as the night were her tresses;\nHer dear little mouth was fluted and red,\nAnd this little French doll was so very well bred\nThat whenever accosted her little mouth said\n\"Mamma! mamma!\"\n\nThe stockinet doll, with one arm and one leg,\nHad once been a handsome young fellow;\nBut now he appeared\nRather frowzy and bleared\nIn his torn regimentals of yellow;\nYet his heart gave a curious thump as he lay\nIn the little toy cart near the window one day\nAnd heard the sweet voice of that French dolly say:\n\"Mamma! mamma!\"\n\nHe listened so long and he listened so hard\nThat anon he grew ever so tender,\nFor it's everywhere known\nThat the feminine tone\nGets away with all masculine gender!\nHe up and he wooed her with soldierly zest\nBut all she'd reply to the love he professed\nWere these plaintive words (which perhaps you have guessed):\n\"Mamma! mamma!\"\n\nHer mother - a sweet little lady of five -\nVouchsafed her parental protection,\nAnd although stockinet\nWasn't blue-blooded, yet\nShe really could make no objection!\nSo soldier and dolly were wedded one day,\nAnd a moment ago, as I journeyed that way,\nI'm sure that I heard a wee baby voice say:\n\"Mamma! mamma!\""}
