{"subject": "The Altar", "text": "Alone, remote, nor witting where I went,\nI found an altar builded in a dream\u2014 \nA fiery place, whereof there was a gleam \nSo swift, so searching, and so eloquent \nOf upward promise, that love\u2019s murmur, blent\nWith sorrow\u2019s warning, gave but a supreme \nUnending impulse to that human stream \nWhose flood was all for the flame\u2019s fury bent. \n\nAlas! I said,\u2014the world is in the wrong. \nBut the same quenchless fever of unrest\nThat thrilled the foremost of that martyred throng \nThrilled me, and I awoke \u2026 and was the same \nBewildered insect plunging for the flame \nThat burns, and must burn somehow for the best."}
