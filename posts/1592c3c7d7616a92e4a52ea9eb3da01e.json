{"subject": "A Lyric", "text": "My lady love lives far away,\nAnd oh my heart is sad by day,\nAnd ah my tears fall fast by night,\nWhat may I do in such a plight.\n\nWhy, miles grow few when love is fleet,\nAnd love, you know, hath flying feet;\nBreak off thy sighs and witness this,\nHow poor a thing mere distance is.\n\nMy love knows not I love her so,\nAnd would she scorn me, did she know?\nHow may the tale I would impart\nAttract her ear and storm her heart?\n\nCalm thou the tempest in my breast,\nWho loves in silence loves the best,\nBut bide thy time, she will awake,\nNo night so dark but morn will break.\n\nBut though my heart so strongly yearn,\nMy lady loves me not in turn,\nHow may I win the blest reply\nThat my void heart shall satisfy.\n\nLove breedeth love, be thou but true,\nAnd soon thy love shall love thee, too;\nIf Fate hath meant you heart for heart,\nThere's naught may keep you twain apart."}
