{"subject": "Hymn #7", "text": "WHAT thoughts come to the Christian's aid,\nUpon a bed of sickness laid,\nWhile nightly watchers silence keep,\nOr close their weary eyes to sleep,\nWhen lamp and faggots waste away,\nAs dimly dawns approaching day?\n'Though here this frame of dust may end,\nMy spirit shall to God ascend,\nAnd, for his sake who died to save\nPoor sinners from a hopeless grave,\nWith all her sins and faults forgiven,\nA peaceful shelter find in heaven;\nA Father's house, a home of love,\nPraised be his name, all praise above!\nWho, even in ruin, loved us still,\nAnd would not soul and body kill!\nAnd blessed be His generous Son,\nWho has for us such mercy won!\nHis gospel sheds a cheering light\nUpon our darkling way, through dreary night.\nA gleam falls from a severed cloud,\nUpon the coffin, and the shroud;\nWhile, high in air, with buoyant swell,\nSounds like a friendly call, the passing bell.'"}
