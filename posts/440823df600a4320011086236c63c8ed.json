{"subject": "The Warden Of The Cinque Ports. (Birds Of Passage. Flight The First)", "text": "A mist was driving down the British Channel,\nThe day was just begun,\nAnd through the window-panes, on floor and panel,\nStreamed the red autumn sun. \n\nIt glanced on flowing flag and rippling pennon,\nAnd the white sails of ships;\nAnd, from the frowning rampart, the black cannon\nHailed it with feverish lips. \n\nSandwich and Romney, Hastings, Hithe, and Dover\nWere all alert that day,\nTo see the French war-steamers speeding over,\nWhen the fog cleared away. \n\nSullen and silent, and like couchant lions,\nTheir cannon, through the night,\nHolding their breath, had watched, in grim defiance,\nThe sea-coast opposite. \n\nAnd now they roared at drum-beat from their stations\nOn every citadel;\nEach answering each, with morning salutations,\nThat all was well. \n\nAnd down the coast, all taking up the burden,\nReplied the distant forts,\nAs if to summon from his sleep the Warden\nAnd Lord of the Cinque Ports. \n\nHim shall no sunshine from the fields of azure,\nNo drum-beat from the wall,\nNo morning gun from the black fort's embrasure,\nAwaken with its call! \n\nNo more, surveying with an eye impartial\nThe long line of the coast,\nShall the gaunt figure of the old Field Marshal\nBe seen upon his post! \n\nFor in the night, unseen, a single warrior,\nIn sombre harness mailed,\nDreaded of man, and surnamed the Destroyer,\nThe rampart wall has scaled. \n\nHe passed into the chamber of the sleeper,\nThe dark and silent room,\nAnd as he entered, darker grew, and deeper,\nThe silence and the gloom. \n\nHe did not pause to parley or dissemble,\nBut smote the Warden hoar;\nAh! what a blow! that made all England tremble\nAnd groan from shore to shore. \n\nMeanwhile, without, the surly cannon waited,\nThe sun rose bright o'erhead;\nNothing in Nature's aspect intimated\nThat a great man was dead."}
