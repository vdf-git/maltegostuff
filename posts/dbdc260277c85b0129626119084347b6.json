{"subject": "Reverie", "text": "At home they see on Skiddaw\nHis royal purple lie,\nAnd autumn up in Newlands\nArrayed in russet die,\nOr under burning woodland\nThe still lake's gramarye.\nAnd far off and grim and sable\nThe menace of the Gable\nLifts up his stark aloofness\nAgainst the western sky.\n\nAt vesper-time in Durham\nThe level evening falls\nUpon the shadowy river\nThat slides by ancient walls,\nWhere out of crannied turrets\nThe mellow belfry calls.\nAnd there sleep brings forgetting\nAnd morning no regretting,\nAnd love is laughter-wedded\nTo health in happy halls."}
