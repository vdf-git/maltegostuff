{"subject": "Peace", "text": "Suddenly bells and flags!\nSuddenly -- door to door --\nTidings!  Can we believe,\nWe, who were used to war? \n\nYet we have dreamed her face,\nKnowing her light must be,\nKnowing that she must come.\nLook -- she comes, it is she! \n\nTattered her raiment floats,\nBlood is upon her wings.\nAh, but her eyes are clear!\nAh, but her voice outrings! \n\nSoon where the shrapnel fell\nPetals shall wake and stir.\nLook -- she is here, she lives!\nBeauty has died for her."}
