{"subject": "Moonlight (Ambitious)", "text": "Ambitious of their solitary reign,\nWhose many-pointed brilliance fills the sky,\nThe silver moon doth rise in majesty,\nAnd with her splendor shares the stars' domain.\nNow as she takes her lucent course on high,\nHer light doth shroud all things in mystery\nAnd subtle glamour. As of realms unknown\nIt seems- a radiance from worlds that lie\nBeyond our ken, and glimpsed in dreams alone.\nAnd in those rays is tender witchery,\nWhich softly doth erase the scars of day,\nAnd with a pallid beauty touches all.\nThe Moon's light is a painter's brush, and she\nAn artist skilled who doth the world array,\nIn silence, with a white, enchanted pall."}
