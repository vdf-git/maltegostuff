{"subject": "Ivry", "text": "NOW glory to the Lord of hosts, from whom all glories are!  \nAnd glory to our sovereign liege, King Henry of Navarre!  \nNow let there be the merry sound of music and of dance,  \nThrough thy corn-fields green, and sunny vines, O pleasant land of France!  \nAnd thou, Rochelle, our own Rochelle, proud city of the waters, \nAgain let rapture light the eyes of all thy mourning daughters.  \nAs thou went constant in our ills, be joyous in our joy;  \nFor cold and stiff and still are they who wrought thy walls annoy.  \nHurrah! hurrah! a single field hath turn\u2019d the chance of war!  \nHurrah! hurrah! for Ivry, and Henry of Navarre. \n\nOh! how our hearts were beating, when, at the dawn of day,  \nWe saw the army of the League drawn out in long array;  \nWith all its priest-led citizens, and all its rebel peers,  \nAnd Appenzel\u2019s stout infantry, and Egmont\u2019s Flemish spears.  \nThere rode the brood of false Lorraine, the curses of our land; \nAnd dark Mayenne was in the midst, a truncheon in his hand;  \nAnd, as we look\u2019d on them, we thought of Seine\u2019s empurpled flood,  \nAnd good Coligni\u2019s hoary hair all dabbled with his blood;  \nAnd we cried unto the living God, who rules the fate of war,  \nTo fight for His own holy name, and Henry of Navarre. \n\nThe king is come to marshal us, in all his armor drest;  \nAnd he has bound a snow-white plume upon his gallant crest.  \nHe look\u2019d upon his people, and a tear was in his eye;  \nHe look\u2019d upon the traitors, and his glance was stern and high.  \nRight graciously he smil\u2019d on us, as roll\u2019d from wing to wing. \nDown all our line, a deafening shout: God save our lord the king!  \n\u201cAnd if my standard-bearer fall, as fall full well he may,  \nFor never I saw promise yet of such a bloody fray,  \nPress where ye see my white plume shine amidst the ranks of war,  \nAnd be your oriflamme to-day the helmet of Navarre.\u201d  \n\nHurrah! the foes are moving. Hark to the mingled din,  \nOf fife, and steed, and trump, and drum, and roaring culverin.  \nThe fiery duke is pricking fast across Saint Andr\u00e9\u2019s plain,  \nWith all the hireling chivalry of Guelders and Almayne.  \nNow by the lips of those ye love, fair gentlemen of France, \nCharge for the golden lilies\u2014upon them with the lance!  \nA thousand spurs are striking deep, a thousand spears in rest,  \nA thousand knights are pressing close behind the snow-white crest;  \nAnd in they burst, and on they rush\u2019d, while, like a guiding star,  \nAmidst the thickest carnage blaz\u2019d the helmet of Navarre. \n\nNow, God be prais\u2019d, the day is ours: Mayenne hath turn\u2019d his rein;  \nD\u2019Aumale hath cried for quarter; the Flemish count is slain.  \nTheir ranks are breaking like thin clouds before a Biscay gale;  \nThe field is heap\u2019d with bleeding steeds, and flags, and cloven mail.  \nAnd then we thought on vengeance, and, all along our van,\nRemember Saint Bartholomew! was pass\u2019d from man to man.  \nBut out spake gentle Henry\u2014\u201cNo French-man is my foe:  \nDown, down with every foreigner, but let your brethren go:\u201d  \nOh! was there ever such a knight, in friendship or in war,  \nAs our sovereign lord, King Henry, the soldier of Navarre? \n\nRight well fought all the Frenchmen who fought for France to-day;  \nAnd many a lordly banner God gave them for a prey.  \nBut we of the religion have borne us best in fight;  \nAnd the good lord of Rosny hath ta\u2019en the cornet white\u2014  \nOur own true Maximilian the cornet white hath ta\u2019en, \nThe cornet white with crosses black, the flag of false Lorraine.  \nUp with it high; unfurl it wide;\u2014that all the host may know  \nHow God hath humbled the proud house which wrought His Church such woe.  \nThen on the ground, while trumpets sound their loudest point of war,  \nFling the red shreds, a footcloth meet for Henry of Navarre. \n\nHo! maidens of Vienna; ho! matrons of Lucerne\u2014  \nWeep, weep, and rend your hair for those who never shall return.  \nHo! Philip, send, for charity, thy Mexican pistoles,  \nThat Antwerp monks may sing a mass for thy poor spearmen\u2019s souls.  \nHo! gallant nobles of the League, look that your arms be bright;\nHo! burghers of St. Genevieve, keep watch and ward to-night;  \nFor our God hath crush\u2019d the tyrant, our God hath rais\u2019d the slave,  \nAnd mock\u2019d the counsel of the wise, and the valor of the brave.  \nThen glory to His holy name, from whom all glories are;  \nAnd glory to our sovereign lord, King Henry of Navarre!"}
