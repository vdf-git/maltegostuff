{"subject": "Raggedy Ann And Raggedy Andy", "text": "Raggedy Ann and Raggedy Andy  \nwhat a beautiful and handsome pair  \nthey both were; \nas they sat upon our chest of drawers  \nlooking happy as can be  \nat the Jack-In-The-Box, Teddy Bear,  \nHumpty Dumpty and other dolls and toys there. Raggedy Ann and Raggedy Andy made such a \nperfect pair with their smiling faces, they \nwere both all right by me, they were among \none of my comforts and joys I had as a  \nchild along with my other toys,  \nteddy bear, and dolls. Raggedy Ann and Raggedy Andy I'll see you both once again soon; \nwe have not changed much at all. Raggedy Ann and Raggedy Andy \nwere my fun and joys."}
