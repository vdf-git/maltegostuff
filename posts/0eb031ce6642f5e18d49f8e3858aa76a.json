{"subject": "When Our Purpose Here Is Done", "text": "When our purpose here is done,\n And our soul, our Lord has won,\n\n He takes us home to live up there,\n To keep us closer in His care.\n\n To give us life in a different place,\n To love and take us in His embrace.\n\n For He knows our wants, our wishes too.\n So He tries on earth to see it through.\n\n For when our pain grows greater still,\n He begins our walk up heavens hill.\n\n Our pain gets dim, our strength gets great,\n For before us, we see the golden gate.\n\n And just inside a beauty glows,\n That here on earth, no one knows.\n\n And there He takes us by the hand\n And leads us into an unknown land.\n\n For when we look into His face,\n We know that heaven is our place.\n\n And there we live with Him on high,\n In His place up in the sky."}
