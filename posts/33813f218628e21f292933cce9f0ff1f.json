{"subject": "The Marriage Voyage Of Juan Ram\u00f3n Jim\u00e9nez 1916 -", "text": "He doesn't know whether to trust sound or vision;\nreaching for Zenobia across the Atlantic, whether to lend \ncredence to the sea's bellyaching or the shadow riven\nfrom the down-slope of a wave. Something distends\n\ninside him, something inorganic balloons the way\nworlds morph in size when we close our eyes. \nThere's the reality of the steamship, there's the bouquet\nof neural transmitters tied with enigmatic pain\u2014\n\nthey co-exist, but they don't overtop one another.\nStepping onto New York only aggravates the rift;\nthough he's greeted by a fianc\u00e9, he'll depend on her\nto traverse the space between tongues, in stretches of transit.\n\nYears later he'll come back to this during exile from\nwar-torn Spain\u2014 the way kissing on the dock\ntaught him how to slide back and forth between the worlds;\nthe sight of her and the noise of their lips' suction\nlike the narrative and the vatic; the clarity of a white-washed \nMoguer home against the Andal\u00fa sky, the resonant wood of its door\u2014\nrecall, above the rest, the continuous demands of the furnace."}
