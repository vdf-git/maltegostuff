{"subject": "I Count The Days", "text": "I count the days, beloved; but not those\nWhen you are absent, though my heart well knows\nThat they are bleak indeed. Rather I say\nUnselfishly, as drifts each laggard day,\n'Long, long ago, in Love's eternal Spring,\nWe sang together, and new hours can bring\nNo greater rapture.' I am ever glad\nOf those lost hours of beauty that we had;\nAnd if within my heart I always hold\nThe memory of their shining threads of gold,\nI fear not when you tread far distant ways...\nO Love, our wondrous past! I count the days!"}
