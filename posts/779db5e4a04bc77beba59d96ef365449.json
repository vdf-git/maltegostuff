{"subject": "I Was Not False To Thee", "text": "I WAS not false to thee, and yet \nMy cheek alone looked pale; \nMy weary eye was dim and wet, \nMy strength began to fail. \nThou wert the same; thy looks were gay, \nThy step was light and free; \nAnd yet, with truth, my heart can say, \nI was not false to thee!\n\nI was not false to thee, yet now \nThou hast a cheerful eye, \nWith flushing cheek and drooping brow \nI wander mournfully. \nI hate to meet the gaze of men, \nI weep where none can see; \nWhy do I only suffer, when \nI was not false to thee?\n\nI was not false to thee; yet oh! \nHow scornfully they smile, \nWho see me droop, who guess my woe, \nYet court thee all the while. \n'Tis strange! but when long years are past, \nThou wilt remember me; \nWhilst I can feel until the last, \nI was not false to thee!"}
