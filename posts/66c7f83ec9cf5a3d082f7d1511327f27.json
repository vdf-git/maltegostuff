{"subject": "The Bobolink", "text": "Bobolink! that in the meadow,\nOr beneath the orchard's shadow,\nKeepest up a constant rattle\nJoyous as my children's prattle,\nWelcome to the north again!\nWelcome to mine ear thy strain,\nWelcome to mine eye the sight\nOf thy buff, thy black and white.\n\nBrighter plumes may greet the sun\nBy the banks of Amazon;\nSweeter tones may weave the spell\nOf enchanting Philomel;\nBut the tropic bird would fail,\nAnd the English nightingale,\nIf we should compare their worth\nWith thine endless, gushing mirth.\n\nWhen the ides of May are past,\nJune and Summer nearing fast,\nWhile from depths of blue above\nComes the mighty breath of love.\nCalling out each bud and flower\nWith resistless, secret power,\nWaking hope and fond desire,\nKindling the erotic fire,\nFilling youths' and maidens' dreams\nWith mysterious, pleasing themes;\nThen, amid the sunlight clear\nFloating in the fragrant air,\nThou dost fill each heart with pleasure\nBy thy glad ecstatic measure.\n\nA single note, so sweet and low,\nLike a full heart's overflow,\nForms the prelude; but the strain\nGives no such tone again,\nFor the wild and saucy song\nLeaps and skips the notes among,\nWith such quick and sportive play,\nNe'er was madder, merrier lay.\n\nGayest songster of the Spring!\nThy melodies before me bring\nVisions of some dream-built land,\nWhere, by constant zephyrs fanned,\nI might walk the livelong day,\nEmbosomed in perpetual May.\nNor care nor fear thy bosom knows;\nFor thee a tempest never blows;\nBut when our northern Summer's o'er,\nBy Delaware's or Schuylkil's shore\nThe wild rice lifts its airy head,\nAnd royal feasts for thee are spread.\nAnd when the Winter threatens there,\nThy tireless wings yet own no fear.\nBut bear thee to more southern coasts,\nFar beyond the reach of frosts.\n\nBobolink! still may thy gladness\nTake from me all taint of sadness;\nFill my soul with trust unshaken\nIn that Being who has taken\nCare for every living thing,\nIn Summer, Winter, Fall, and Spring."}
