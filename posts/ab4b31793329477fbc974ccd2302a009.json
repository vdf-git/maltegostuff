{"subject": "London Types: Drum-Major", "text": "Who says Drum-Major says a man of mould, \nShaking the meek earth with tremendous tread, \nAnd pacing still, a triumph to behold, \nOf his own spine at least two yards ahead! \nAttorney, grocer, surgeon, broker, duke- \nHis calling may be anything, who comes \nInto a room, his presence a rebuke \nTo the dejected, as the pipes and drums \nInspired his port!-who mounts his office stairs \nAs though he led great armies to the fight! \nHis bulk itself's pure genius, and he wears \nHis avoirdupois with so much fire and spright \nThat, though the creature stands but five feet five, \nYou take him for the tallest He alive."}
