{"subject": "The Hill.", "text": "The holy lamps of Evening shine\nSheer in the West \u2014 the air is still \u2014\nAs I sit with this heart of mine\nAt the foot of Parnassus' hill.\nThrough my life's day I've reached to this \u2014\nTo see where the immortals trod,\nWinding up the dark height, I wis,\nTill they came on the light of God.\nAh! I, a pilgrim with tired feet,\nHave touched the verge of their renown,\nAs I look up on Homer's seat\nAnd know the bards may not come down.\nStill on those peaks, as powers apart,\nThey breathe the air now breathed by me,\nFor each has climbed the human heart \u2014\nThe deathless hill of Poesy!"}
