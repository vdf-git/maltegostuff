{"subject": "Once I Pass'D Through A Populous City", "text": "ONCE I pass'd through a populous city, imprinting my brain, for\n         future use, with its shows, architecture, customs, and\n         traditions;\n   Yet now, of all that city, I remember only a woman I casually met\n         there, who detain'd me for love of me;\n   Day by day and night by night we were together,--All else has long\n         been forgotten by me;\n   I remember, I say, only that woman who passionately clung to me;\n   Again we wander--we love--we separate again;\n   Again she holds me by the hand--I must not go!\n   I see her close beside me, with silent lips, sad and tremulous."}
