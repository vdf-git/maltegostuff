{"subject": "When Pa Gets Back", "text": "I'M allus glad when my Pa gets back\nFrom the shu-shu cars and the railroad track,\nOr a big boat ride, which he often does,\nOh, I 'm orful glad when he's back becoz\nJes' as soon as he's kissed my ma an' me\nHe laffs, an' says: 'Come along an' see\nThe wonderful things in my old black grip,\nThe things I got on my little trip.'\n\nNen he puts his grip on a parlor chair,\nAn' he says to me: 'Now stand right there\nAn' we'll jes' see what is inside o' this,\nBut first we'll all have another kiss.'\nNen he opens his grip, an' it's jes' crammed tight\nWith toys an' things. Oh, I wish you might\nBe there some day when my Pa gets back\nTo see the things in his old grip sack.\n\nThere's allus a doll for his little girl,\nWhich is me \u2014 a doll with a yellow curl:\nAn' the very last time that he went away\nI really couldn't begin to say\nAll the wonderful things that he brought to me\nCoz I 'd been good, as I said I 'd be;\nI 'm sure that I couldn't tell them all,\nBut one was a new pink parasol.\n\nAn' he brought me some books an' some candy, too,\nAn' anuvver dolly all dressed in blue,\nAn' a broom jes' made for a girl like me,\nAn' the nicest hair ribbons ever you see,\nAn' a spade an' a rake to dig in sand,\nAn' some dishes my Ma says are Heavyland;\nI cry when my Pa goes away, but when\nHe gets back home I am glad again."}
