{"subject": "By Life Tormented", "text": "By life tormented, and by cunning hope,\nWhen my soul surrenders in its battle with them,\nDay and night I press my eyelids closed\nAnd sometimes I'm vouchsafed peculiar visions.\n\nThe gloom of quotidian existence deepens,\nAs after a bright flash of autumn lightning,\nAnd only in the sky, like a call from the heart,\nThe stars' golden eyelashes sparkle.\n\nAnd the flames of infinity are so transparent,\nAnd the entire abyss of ether is so close,\nThat I gaze direct from time into eternity\nAnd recognize your flame, universal sun.\n\nMotionless, encircled by fiery roses,\nThe living altar of the cosmos smolders\nAnd in its smoke, as in creative slumber,\nAll forces quiver, eternity's a dream.\n\nAnd all that rushes through the abyss of ether,\nAnd every ray, embodied or ethereal,-\nIs but your reflection, O universal sun,\nIt is but a dream, but a fleeting dream.\n\nThrough the worldly breath of these reveries \nI fly like smoke, involuntarily disperse,\nAnd in this vision, in this delirium,\nI can live with ease and breathe without pain.\n\nIn the darkness and still of a mysterious night\nI see a fond and welcoming spark,\nFrom the chorus of spheres, familiar eyes\nShine upon a grave forgotten in the steppe.\n\nThe grass has faded, the desert is grim,\nA lonely tomb dreams an orphan's dream,\nAnd only in the sky, like an eternal idea,\nThe stars' golden eyelashes sparkle.\n\nAnd I dream you've risen from the dead,\nUnchanged since you departed the earth,\nAnd I dream a dream: we both are young,\nAnd you've looked at me as you did back then."}
