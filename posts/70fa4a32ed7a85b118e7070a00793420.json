{"subject": "Forward", "text": "I've tinkered at my bits of rhymes\nIn weary, woeful, waiting times;\nIn doleful hours of battle-din,\nEre yet they brought the wounded in;\nThrough vigils of the fateful night,\nIn lousy barns by candle-light;\nIn dug-outs, sagging and aflood,\nOn stretchers stiff and bleared with blood;\nBy ragged grove, by ruined road,\nBy hearths accurst where Love abode;\nBy broken altars, blackened shrines\nI've tinkered at my bits of rhymes.\n\nI've solaced me with scraps of song\nThe desolated ways along:\nThrough sickly fields all shrapnel-sown,\nAnd meadows reaped by death alone;\nBy blazing cross and splintered spire,\nBy headless Virgin in the mire;\nBy gardens gashed amid their bloom,\nBy gutted grave, by shattered tomb;\nBeside the dying and the dead,\nWhere rocket green and rocket red,\nIn trembling pools of poising light,\nWith flowers of flame festoon the night.\nAh me! by what dark ways of wrong\nI've cheered my heart with scraps of song.\n\nSo here's my sheaf of war-won verse,\nAnd some is bad, and some is worse.\nAnd if at times I curse a bit,\nYou needn't read that part of it;\nFor through it all like horror runs\nThe red resentment of the guns.\nAnd you yourself would mutter when\nYou took the things that once were men,\nAnd sped them through that zone of hate\nTo where the dripping surgeons wait;\nAnd wonder too if in God's sight\nWar ever, ever can be right.\n\nYet may it not be, crime and war\nBut effort misdirected are?\nAnd if there's good in war and crime,\nThere may be in my bits of rhyme,\nMy songs from out the slaughter mill:\nSo take or leave them as you will."}
