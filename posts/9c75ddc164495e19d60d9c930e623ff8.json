{"subject": "Nightfall In Dordrecht", "text": "The mill goes toiling slowly around\nWith steady and solemn creak,\nAnd my little one hears in the kindly sound\nThe voice of the old mill speak.\nWhile round and round those big white wings \nGrimly and ghostlike creep,\nMy little one hears that the old mill sings\n\u201cSleep, little tulip, sleep!\u201d\n\nThe sails are reefed and the nets are drawn,\nAnd, over his pot of beer, \nThe fisher, against the morrow\u2019s dawn,\nLustily maketh cheer.\nHe mocks at the winds that caper along\nFrom the far-off clamorous deep,\u2014\nBut we\u2014we love their lullaby song \nOf \u201cSleep, little tulip, sleep!\u201d\n\nOld dog Fritz in slumber sound\nGroans of the stony mart:\nTo-morrow how proudly he \u2019ll trot you round,\nHitched to our new milk-cart! \nAnd you shall help me blanket the kine\nAnd fold the gentle sheep,\nAnd set the herring a-soak in brine,\u2014\nBut now, little tulip, sleep!\n\nA Dream-One comes to button the eyes \nThat wearily droop and blink,\nWhile the old mill buffets the frowning skies\nAnd scolds at the stars that wink;\nOver your face the misty wings\nOf that beautiful Dream-One sweep, \nAnd rocking your cradle she softly sings\n\u201cSleep, little tulip, sleep!\u201d"}
