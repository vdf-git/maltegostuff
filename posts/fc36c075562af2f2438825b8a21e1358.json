{"subject": "From The Short Story Shadow-Children", "text": "Little shadows, little shadows \nDancing on the chamber wall, \nWhile I sit beside the hearthstone \nWhere the red flames rise and fall. \nCaps and nightgowns, caps and nightgowns, \nMy three antic shadows wear; \nAnd no sound they make in playing, \nFor the six small feet are bare. \n\nDancing gayly, dancing gayly, \nTo and fro all together, \nLike a family of daisies \nBlown about in windy weather; \nNimble fairies, nimble fairies, \nPlaying pranks in the warm glow, \nWhile I sing the nursery ditties \nChildish phantoms love and know. \n\nNow what happens, now what happens? \nOne small shadow's tumbled down: \nI can see it on the carpet \nSoftly rubbing its hurt crown. \nNo one whimpers, no one whimpers; \nA brave-hearted sprite is this: \nSee! the others offer comfort \nIn a silent, shadowy kiss. \n\nHush! they're creeping; hush! they're creeping, \nUp about my rocking-chair: \nI can feel their loving fingers \nClasp my neck and touch my hair. \nLittle shadows, little shadows, \nTake me captive, hold me tight, \nAs they climb and cling and whisper, \n\"Mother dear, good night! good night!\""}
