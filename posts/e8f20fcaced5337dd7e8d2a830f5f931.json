{"subject": "The Builder", "text": "Come and let me make thee glad\nIn this house that I have made!\nNowhere ( I am unafraid!)\nCanst thou find its like on Earth:\nCome, and learn the perfect worth\n\nOf the labor I have had. \n\nI have fashioned it for thee,\nEvery room and pictured wall;\nEvery marble pillar tall,\nEvery door and window-place;\nAll were done that thy fair face\nMight look kindlier on me.\n\nHere, moreover, thou shalt find\nStrange, delightful, far-brought things:\nDulcimers, whose tightened strings,\nOnce, dead women loved to touch;\n(Deeming they could mimic much\nOf the music of the wind!)\n\nHeavy candlesticks of brass;\nChess-men carved of ivory;\nMass-books written perfectly\nBy some patient monk of old;\nFlagons wrought of thick, red gold,\nSet with gems and colored glass;\n\nBurnished armor, once some knight\n(Dead, I deem, long wars ago!)\nIts great strength was glad to know\nWhen his Lady needed him:\n(Now that both his eyes are dim\nBoth his sword and shield are bright!)\n\nCome, and share these things with me,\nMen have died to leave to us!\nWe shall find life glorious\nIn this splendid house of love;\nCome, and claim thy part thereof,\u2015\nI have fashioned it for thee!"}
