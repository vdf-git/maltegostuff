{"subject": "Gravity and Center", "text": "I'm sorry I cannot say I love you when you say \n\nyou love me. The words, like moist fingers, \n\nappear before me full of promise but then run away \n\nto a narrow black room that is always dark, \n\nwhere they are silent, elegant, like antique gold, \n\ndevouring the thing I feel. I want the force \n\nof attraction to crush the force of repulsion \n\nand my inner and outer worlds to pierce \n\none another, like a horse whipped by a man. \n\nI don't want words to sever me from reality. \n\nI don't want to need them. I want nothing\n\nto reveal feeling but feeling\u2014as in freedom,\n\nor the knowledge of peace in a realm beyond, \n\nor the sound of water poured in a bowl."}
