{"subject": "The Common Women Poems, III. Nadine, resting on her neighbor's stoop", "text": "She holds things together, collects bail,\nmakes the landlord patch the largest holes.\nAt the Sunday social she would spike\nevery drink, and offer you half of what she knows,\nwhich is plenty. She pokes at the ruins of the city\nlike an armored tank; but she thinks\nof herself as a ripsaw cutting through\nknots in wood. Her sentences come out\nlike thick pine shanks\nand her big hands fill the air like smoke.\nShe's a mud-chinked cabin in the slums,\nsitting on the doorstep counting\nrats and raising 15 children,\nhalf of them her own. The neighborhood\nwould burn itself out without her;\none of these days she'll strike the spark herself.\nShe's made of grease\nand metal, with a hard head\nthat makes the men around her seem frail.\nThe common woman is as common as\na nail."}
