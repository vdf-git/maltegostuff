{"subject": "Verse", "text": "Past ruined Ilion Helen lives,\nAlcestis rises from the shades.\nVerse calls them forth; 'tis verse that gives\nImmortal youth to mortal maids.\n\nSoon shall oblivion's deepening veil\nHide all the peopled hills you see,\nThe gay, the proud, while lovers hail\nThese many summers you and me."}
