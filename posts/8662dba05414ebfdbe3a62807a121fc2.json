{"subject": "Southern Cross", "text": "I wanted you, nameless Woman of the South, \nNo wraith, but utterly\u2014as still more alone \nThe Southern Cross takes night \nAnd lifts her girdles from her, one by one\u2014 \nHigh, cool, \nwide from the slowly smoldering fire \nOf lower heavens,\u2014 \nvaporous scars! \nEve! Magdalene! \nor Mary, you? \nWhatever call\u2014falls vainly on the wave. \nO simian Venus, homeless Eve, \nUnwedded, stumbling gardenless to grieve \nWindswept guitars on lonely decks forever; \nFinally to answer all within one grave! \nAnd this long wake of phosphor, \niridescent \nFurrow of all our travel\u2014trailed derision! \nEyes crumble at its kiss. Its long-drawn spell \nIncites a yell. Slid on that backward vision \nThe mind is churned to spittle, whispering hell. \nI wanted you . . . The embers of the Cross \nClimbed by aslant and huddling aromatically. \nIt is blood to remember; it is fire \nTo stammer back . . . It is \nGod\u2014your namelessness. And the wash\u2014 \nAll night the water combed you with black \nInsolence. You crept out simmering, accomplished. \nWater rattled that stinging coil, your \nRehearsed hair\u2014docile, alas, from many arms. \nYes, Eve\u2014wraith of my unloved seed! \nThe Cross, a phantom, buckled\u2014dropped below the dawn. \nLight drowned the lithic trillions of your spawn."}
