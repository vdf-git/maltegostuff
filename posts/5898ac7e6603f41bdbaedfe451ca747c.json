{"subject": "Strange Celestial Roads", "text": "There's a father sleeping it off in every master bedroom \n     of the cul-de-sac the morning after, so Saturday\nmorning is a snooze. The moon is still out, eyeballing\n     the quiet street like Sun Ra did his Arkestra. Somebody\nhas to be a father figure for all of those musical notes.\n     No school busses to huff after, no mothers yelling\ntheir children onward. The only weekend noise is us,\n     kicking rocks\u2014so bored we can't even hear each other\u2014\non a celestial swirl of asphalt that will be a playground\n     one day. We stand, right feet extended in unison like foos\nmen, rock after rock arcing at sorry angles toward\n     the open bar that hopes to dangle four swings. Some\nrocks go through, some miss as we balance on concrete\n    meant to backstop hop scotch &amp; echo knock knock jokes.\nNot somebody's father, finally up &amp; at \u2018em, yelling,\n    You got to be kidding me, after he opens the property tax\nbill. Maybe these bars were placed here for some other,\n    future kids to be dragged away from by big ears\nor red necks toward the unavoidable arguments, fist-to-face\n     noises &amp; the bleating saxophones that come after."}
