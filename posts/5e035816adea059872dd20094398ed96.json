{"subject": "Sun And Shade", "text": "In the summer sunshine\nLilian swings at ease,\nIn a silken hammock\n'Neath umbrageous trees.\nFairest, sweetest blossom\nIn that bower of bloom,\nCare hath never found her,\nNaught she knows of gloom,\nScarce has felt the rippling\nOf her life's clear stream;\nhers the listless languor\nOf a first love-dream.\n\nIn the sombre midnight\nDora droops alone,\nPast and present weighted\nBy a slab of stone.\nIn her cheerless attic,\nWhence e'en hope hath fled,\nDrearily since dawning\nStitching for her bread,\nPlying thread and needle\nWith unflagging speed,\nTill they drop unbidden\nAnd she rests indeed.\n\nShadow and sunshine, light and shade,\nWere twinned when day and night were made;\nLaughter and weeping, pain and mirth,\nTrack each other over the earth;\nAnd not till night and day are done\nShall we know the 'wherefore' of shade or sun."}
