{"subject": "The Whispers Of Time", "text": "What does time whisper, youth gay and light,\nWhile thinning thy locks, silken and bright,\nWhile paling thy soft cheek\u2019s roseate dye,\nDimming the light of thy flashing eye,\nStealing thy bloom and freshness away\u2014\nIs he not hinting at death\u2014decay? \n\nMan, in the wane of thy stately prime,\nHear\u2019st thou the silent warnings of Time?\nLook at thy brow ploughed by anxious care,\nThe silver hue of thy once dark hair;\u2014\nWhat boot thine honors, thy treasures bright,\nWhen Time tells of coming gloom and night? \n\nSad age, dost thou note thy strength nigh, spent,\nHow slow thy footstep\u2014thy form how bent?\nYet on looking back how short doth seem\nThe checkered coarse of thy life\u2019s brief dream.\nTime, daily weakening each link and tie,\nDoth whisper how soon thou art to die. \n\nO! what a weary world were ours\nWith that thought to cloud our brightest hours,\nDid we not know that beyond the skies\nA land of beauty and promise ties,\nWhere peaceful and blessed we will love\u2014adore\u2014\nWhen Time itself shall be no more!"}
