{"subject": "A Ballad Of Heaven", "text": "The River of Heaven wheels round at night\nDrifting the circling stars,\nAt Silver Bank*, the floating clouds\nMimic the murmur of water.\nBy the Palace of Jade the cassia blossoms\nHave not yet fallen,\nFairy maidens gather their fragrance\nFor their dangling girdle-sachets.\n\nThe Princess from Ch'in rolls up her blinds,\nDawn at the north casement.\nIn front of the window, a planted kolanut\nDwarfs the blue phoenix.\nThe King's son plays his pipes\nLong as goose-quills,\nSummoning dragons to plough the mist\nand plant Jade Grass.\n\nSashes of pink as clouds at dawn.\nSkirts of lotus-root silk,\nThey walk on Blue Island, gathering\nFresh orchids in spring.\n\nShe points to Hsi Ho in the east,\nDeftly urging his steeds,\nWhile land begins to rise from the sea\nAnd stone hills wear away."}
