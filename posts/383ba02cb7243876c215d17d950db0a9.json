{"subject": "Not Stopping by the Woods on a Snowy Evening", "text": "I\n\nPromises to keep was a lie, he had nothing. Through \nthe woods. Over the river and into the pain. It is an addict's\ntalk of quitting as she's smacking at a vein. He was always\ngoing into the woods. It was he who wrote, The best way\n\nout is always through. You'd think a shrink, but no, a poet.\nHe saw the woods and knew. The forest is the one that holds\npromises. The woods are lovely, dark, and deep, they fill \nwith a quiet snow. Miles are traveled as we sleep. He steers\n\nhis horse off the road. Among the trees now, the blizzard \nis a dusting. Holes in the canopy make columns of snowstorm, \nlit from above. His little horse thinks it is queer. They go\ndeeper, sky gets darker. It's the darkest night of the year.\n\n                                                              II\n\nHe had no promises to keep, nothing pending. Had no bed\nto head to, measurably away in miles. He was a freak like me,\nmonster of the dawn. Whose woods these are I think I know,\nhis house is in the village though. In the middle of life\n\nhe found himself lost in a dark woods. I discovered myself\nin a somber forest. In between my breasts and breaths I got\nlost. The woods are lovely, dark and deep. But I've got promises\nto keep, smiles to go before I leap. I'm going into the woods.\n\nThey're lovely dark, and deep, which is what I want, deep lovely \ndarkness. No one has asked, let alone taken, a promise of me,\nno one will notice if I choose bed or rug, couch or forest deep. \nIt doesn't matter where I sleep. It doesn't matter where I sleep."}
