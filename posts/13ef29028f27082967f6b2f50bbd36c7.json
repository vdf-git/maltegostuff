{"subject": "On Death", "text": "In common parlance death comes as the end \nBut the quip doth fail the message to send \nFor death is the season of a life without end \nAnd it is the reason for our lives to mend. Purely material creation is but earth bound \nBut the human being is hell or heaven bound. \nMaking repentance a choiceless mandate by hour eleven \nTo even get to purgatory, half way home to heaven. By the sense of annihilation, death is daunting, \nBy the mere finality of this thing, terrifying. \nA sudden end to who you are and all you know \nA sudden entry into a dimension you do not know. Yet the repose of the body laden with transgression \nYet the relief of the soul riddled with flagellation, \nA peaceable sleep in the bosom of mother nature \nIrrevocable step in the region of the human future. All life by thought of death is cravenly petrified \nSo by thought of life, though with charter indemnified. \nAmbiguous situation, afraid to live, afraid to die \nwhat paradox! born to die, please tell me why."}
