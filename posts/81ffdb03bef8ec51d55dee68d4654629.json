{"subject": "Thinking", "text": "~When I wake up I hear you\n The footsteps behind me\n Slowly they glide\n\n~I didn't expect to see you\n But you were there waiting\n Waiting in the clouds\n\n~My eyes covered by the sun\n I saw your hair melt in them\n Why did I fall so fast? \n\n~I know this is a dream\n Touching the sky ripples appear\n I had one wish and this by ~Thinking~"}
