{"subject": "The Ballad Of Fisher's Boarding-House", "text": "That night, when through the mooring-chains\n  The wide-eyed corpse rolled free,\nTo blunder down by Garden Reach\n  And rot at Kedgeree,\nThe tale the Hughli told the shoal\n  The lean shoal told to me.\n\n'T was Fultah Fisher's boarding-house,\n  Where sailor-men reside,\nAnd there were men of all the ports\n  From Mississip to Clyde,\nAnd regally they spat and smoked,\n  And fearsomely they lied.\n\nThey lied about the purple Sea\n  That gave them scanty bread,\nThey lied about the Earth beneath,\n  The Heavens overhead,\nFor they had looked too often on\n  Black rum when that was red.\n\nThey told their tales of wreck and wrong,\n  Of shame and lust and fraud,\nThey backed their toughest statements with\n  The Brimstone of the Lord,\nAnd crackling oaths went to and fro\n  Across the fist-banged board.\n\nAnd there was Hans the blue-eyed Dane,\n  Bull-throated, bare of arm,\nWho carried on his hairy chest\n  The maid Ultruda's charm --\nThe little silver crucifix\n  That keeps a man from harm.\n\nAnd there was Jake Withouth-the-Ears,\n  And Pamba the Malay,\nAnd Carboy Gin the Guinea cook,\n  And Luz from Vigo Bay,\nAnd Honest Jack who sold them slops\n  And harvested their pay.\n\nAnd there was Salem Hardieker,\n  A lean Bostonian he --\nRuss, German, English, Halfbreed, Finn,\n  Yank, Dane, and Portuguee,\nAt Fultah Fisher's boarding-house\n  The rested from the sea.\n\nNow Anne of Austria shared their drinks,\n  Collinga knew her fame,\nFrom Tarnau in Galicia\n  To Juan Bazaar she came,\nTo eat the bread of infamy\n  And take the wage of shame.\n\nShe held a dozen men to heel --\n  Rich spoil of war was hers,\nIn hose and gown and ring and chain,\n  From twenty mariners,\nAnd, by Port Law, that week, men called\n  her Salem Hardieker's.\n\nBut seamen learnt -- what landsmen know --\n  That neither gifts nor gain\nCan hold a winking Light o' Love\n  Or Fancy's flight restrain,\nWhen Anne of Austria rolled her eyes\n  On Hans the blue-eyed Dane.\n\nSince Life is strife, and strife means knife,\n  From Howrah to the Bay,\nAnd he may die before the dawn\n  Who liquored out the day,\nIn Fultah Fisher's boarding-house\n  We woo while yet we may.\n\nBut cold was Hans the blue-eyed Dane,\n  Bull-throated, bare of arm,\nAnd laughter shook the chest beneath\n  The maid Ultruda's charm --\nThe little silver crucifix\n  That keeps a man from harm.\n\n\"You speak to Salem Hardieker;\n  \"You was his girl, I know.\n\"I ship mineselfs to-morrow, see,\n  \"Und round the Skaw we go,\n\"South, down the Cattegat, by Hjelm,\n  \"To Besser in Saro.\"\n\nWhen love rejected turns to hate,\n  All ill betide the man.\n\"You speak to Salem Hardieker\" --\n  She spoke as woman can.\nA scream -- a sob -- \"He called me -- names!\"\n  And then the fray began.\n\nAn oath from Salem Hardieker,\n  A shriek upon the stairs,\nA dance of shadows on the wall,\n  A knife-thrust unawares --\nAnd Hans came down, as cattle drop,\n  Across the broken chairs.\n\n.       .       .       .       .       .\n\nIn Anne of Austria's trembling hands\n  The weary head fell low: --\n\"I ship mineselfs to-morrow, straight\n  \"For Besser in Saro;\n\"Und there Ultruda comes to me\n  \"At Easter, und I go\n\n\"South, down the Cattegat -- What's here?\n  \"There -- are -- no -- lights -- to guide!\"\nThe mutter ceased, the spirit passed,\n  And Anne of Austria cried\nIn Fultah Fisher's boarding-house\n  When Hans the mighty died.\n\nThus slew they Hans the blue-eyed Dane,\n  Bull-throated, bare of arm,\nBut Anne of Austria looted first\n  The maid Ultruda's charm --\nThe little silver crucifix\n  That keeps a man from harm."}
