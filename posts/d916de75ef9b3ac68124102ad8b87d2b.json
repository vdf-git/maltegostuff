{"subject": "An Hour In A Studio", "text": "(SINGING OF THE PLAINSMEN) \n\nEACH picture was a painted memory \nOf the far plains he loved, and of their life, \nWeird, mystical, dark, inarticulate, \u2014 \nAnd cities hidden high against the blue, \nWhose sky-hung steps one Indian could guard. \nThe enchanted Mesa there its fated wall \nLifted, and all its story lived again; \nHow, in the happy planting time, the strong \nWent down to push the seeds into the sand, \nLeaving the old and sick. Then reeled the world \nAnd toppled to the plain the perilous path. \nDeath climbed another way to them who stayed. \nHe showed us pictured thirst, a dreadful sight; \nAnd many tales he told that might have come,\u2014 \nBrought by some planet-wanderer, \u2014fresh from Mars, \nOr from the silver deserts of the moon. \n\nBut I remember better than all else \nOne night he told of in that land of fright,\u2014 \nThe love-songs swarthy men sang to their herds \nOn the high plains to keep the beasts in heart; \nPiercing the silence one keen tenor voice \nSinging 'Ai nostri monti' clear and high: \nInstead of stakes and fences round about \nThey circled them with music in the night."}
