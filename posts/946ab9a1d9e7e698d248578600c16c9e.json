{"subject": "Animals", "text": "Far off I see my docile animals.\nThey are tall and their manes are burning.\nThey run, searching for a spring,\nand sniff the purple among broken rushes.\n\nSlowly they drink the very shade.\nNow and then they lift their heads.\nThey gaze in profile, happy almost\nat the lightness of the air.\n\nThey place their muzzles close beside your loins,\nwhere the body's grass is most confused,\nand like a creature basking in the sun,\nslowly they breathe, soothed and calm.\n\nTranslation: 2003, Alexis Levitin"}
