{"subject": "Nursery Rhyme (Crooked But Wise)", "text": "There was a crooked man\nWho walked a crooked mile,\nWhile the crooked hands ran backwards\nAround the crooked dial.\nHe found his crooked journey\nLed him through a crooked town,\nWhere all his crooked neighbours\nWere running up and down,\nAnd conducting crooked business\nIn crooked shops and stalls,\nWhile their shadows capered crookedly\nUpon the crooked walls,\nSo he followed their example\nAnd, as he passed along,\nSold his birthright for a fortune:\nHe had got it for a song.\nHe thought he had a bargain,\nAnd was overheard to say,\n\u2018That sometime every crooked dog\nMust have his day.\u201d\nBut even as he said it,\nAnd drew a crooked breath,\nHe reached his crooked mile\u2019s end\nAnd was straightened out by death."}
