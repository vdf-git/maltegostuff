O merry world,\nHast thou forgot the glory of those eyes\nWhich first looked love in thine? Thou hast not furled\nOne banner of thy bridal car for them.\nO world, in very truth thou art too young.\nThere was a voice which sang about thy Spring,\nTill Winter froze the sweetness of his lips,\nAnd lo, the worms had hardly left his tongue\nBefore thy nightingales were come again.\nO world, what courage hast thou thus to sing?\nSay, has thy merriment no secret pain\nNo sudden weariness that thou art young?"}
