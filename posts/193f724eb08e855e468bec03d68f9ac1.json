{"subject": "To Mr. ------", "text": "For ever blest be that prolific brain \nWhich can such stores of images contain! \nThus the charg'd trees, with blooming odours crown'd, \nShed their fair blossoms with profusion round; \nSo swells the brook with heav'n descended rain, \nAnd flows meand'ring on thirsty plain; \nSuch various talents were by Heav'n design'd \nToo vast a treasure for a single mind), \nTo please, astonish, and instruct mankind. \nWith a delight not to be told, I view \nThemes long exhausted in your hands grow new; \nPast all describing your descriptions are, \nSo full, so just, so bold, yet regular; \nThe style so varied that it wants a name, \nWhich, ever differing, ever is the same; \nYou raise or calm our passions as you please, \nThe human heart your powerful pen obeys. \nWhen eager Trasimond pursues the course, \nWe hear the whip, and see the foaming horse; \nWith Sophronia we have wept and smil'd, \nSo soon offended -- sooner reconcil'd. \nGo on, great author! that the world may see \nHow bright, when from pedantic fetters free, \nTrue genius shines, and shines alone in thee. \nGive new editions, with a noble scorn \nOf insect critics, who'd obscure thy morn; \nNeglect their censures, nor thy work delay, \nThe owls still sicken at the sight of day."}
