{"subject": "To The Rock That Will Be A Cornerstone Of The House", "text": "Old garden of grayish and ochre lichen,\nHow long a rime since the brown people who have vanished from\nhere\nBuilt fires beside you and nestled by you\nOut of the ranging sea-wind? A hundred years, two hundred,\nYou have been dissevered from humanity\nAnd only known the stubble squirrels and the headland rabbits,\nOr the long-fetlocked plowhorses\nBreaking the hilltop in December, sea-gulls following,\nScreaming in the black furrow; no one\nTouched you with love, the gray hawk and the red hawk touched\nyou\nWhere now my hand lies. So I have brought you\nWine and white milk and honey for the hundred years of famine\nAnd the hundred cold ages of sea-wind.\n\nI did not dream the taste of wine could bind with granite,\nNor honey and milk please you; but sweetly\nThey mingle down the storm-worn cracks among the mosses,\nInterpenetrating the silent\nWing-prints of ancient weathers long at peace, and the older\nScars of primal fire, and the stone\nEndurance that is waiting millions of years to carry\nA corner of the house, this also destined.\nLend me the stone strength of the past and I will lend you\nThe wings of the future, for I have them.\nHow dear you will be to me when I too grow old, old comrade."}
