{"subject": "AVATAR", "text": "Trees of utter lies,\nleaves of flames,\nflowers of ash.\nLead me, someone, out of this forest.\n\nI have wandered forever,\ncarrying a couple of damp words,\nstumbling across steam-blinded tracks,\nfeet slashed by\nrusted vessels, broken tiles, half-cooked meals,\ntattered clothes, roofless screams, broken bones,\nstooped bodies that turn to stone when you touch them.\n\nI roam every day\nlike a ghost from some stammering past\nor some endlessly hungry, never appeased\nunknown evil deity\nblind to himself,\na lost sun\nor death.\nFrom these woods\nof ulcerous, oozing, burning, cracked mirrors\nsomeone\nlead me, out of this forest."}
