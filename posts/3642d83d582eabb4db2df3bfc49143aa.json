{"subject": "[What ever happens]", "text": "What ever happens: we've got several birch trees by  \nthe open window, and anything will match with them. Every\nhand gesture, a start, perhaps, a piece of paper.\nOr the row of houses in rain or sun or as \nlarge, skinned salmon. Women and children begin  \nto call, bind their voices to the birches, attempt \nsomething, go on. We feel a wave on our \ncheeks. Our fingers appear and play and  \nbecome more and more. We can do no wrong.\nIf  we too match the birches, playfully changing our\nmoods, sitting somewhere with summer shoes on,\nbacks to the salmon. Salmon, we say, salmon, and then ask: \nWho'll provide the water, the grates, the weatherproof\nscales? Now the air in every room is salmon air, the\nouter air of birches. And the voices of women and \nchildren run without women and children around the \nbirches.\n\nTranslated by Brian Currid"}
