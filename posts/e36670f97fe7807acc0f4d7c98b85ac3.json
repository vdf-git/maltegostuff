{"subject": "Now That You Too", "text": "Now that you too must shortly go the way \nWhich in these bloodshot years uncounted men \nHave gone in vanishing armies day by day, \nAnd in their numbers will not come again: \nI must not strain the moments of our meeting \nStriving for each look, each accent, not to miss, \nOr question of our parting and our greeting, \nIs this the last of all? is this\u2014or this? \n\nLast sight of all it may be with these eyes, \nLast touch, last hearing, since eyes, hands, and ears, \nEven serving love, are our mortalities, \nAnd cling to what they own in mortal fears:\u2014 \nBut oh, let end what will, I hold you fast \nBy immortal love, which has no first or last."}
