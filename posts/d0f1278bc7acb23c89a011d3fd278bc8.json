What have you for me this morning? \nYour empty eyes are stocked with nocturnal visions, \nIn your cheek's cold and taciturn reflection, \nI see insanity and horror forming. \nThe green succubus and the red urchin, \nHave they poured you fear and love from their urns? \nThe nightmare of a mutinous fist that despotically turns, \nDoes it drown you at the bottom of a loch beyond searching? \n\nI wish that your breast exhaled the scent of sanity, \nThat your womb of thought was not a tomb more frequently \nAnd that your Christian blood flowed around a buoy that was rhythmical, \n\nLike the numberless sounds of antique syllables, \nWhere reigns in turn the father of songs, \nPhoebus, and the great Pan, the harvest sovereign.\nTranslated by William A.
