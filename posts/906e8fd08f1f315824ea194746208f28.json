{"subject": "Listen!", "text": "When you let your heart speak I speak -- Listen!\n I am the voice -- the still small voice of your heart... just Listen\n I am the voice of one, not two, crying in the wilderness\n of your earthbound, entangling, imprisoning thoughts.\n I am here now... Listen!\n\n I am come to you --- Listen!\n Oh, earth enshrouded voices, earth enshrouded choices\n BE GONE\n Won't you hear, won't you hear... won't you hear?\n Will you Listen... and Listen... then... Listen?\n\n Silence the Gongs of Despair dear heart\n Silence the Thoughts of Dismay\n Relax the tensions. Relax the brain\n The World gone mad and in such disarray\n You are still --- I am here --- and you Listen ---\n\n From out the depths of the soul of Me\n The power of such silence melts misery\n You're dissolved in a New Identity\n You have heard -- and you know -- yes, Now you See\n You have Listened --- Life is New --- and You are Free!"}
