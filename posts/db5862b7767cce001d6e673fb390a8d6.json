{"subject": "Holy Sonnet Xi: Spit In My Face You Jews, And Pierce My Side", "text": "Spit in my face you Jews, and pierce my side,\nBuffet, and scoff, scourge, and crucify me,\nFor I have sinned, and sinned, and only he\nWho could do no iniquity hath died:\nBut by my death can not be satisfied\nMy sins, which pass the Jews' impiety:\nThey killed once an inglorious man, but I\nCrucify him daily, being now glorified.\nOh let me, then, his strange love still admire:\nKings pardon, but he bore our punishment.\nAnd Jacob came clothed in vile harsh attire\nBut to supplant, and with gainful intent:\nGod clothed himself in vile man's flesh, that so\nHe might be weak enough to suffer woe."}
