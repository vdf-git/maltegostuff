{"subject": "Mona Lisa", "text": "Yon strange blue city crowns a scarped steep\nNo mortal foot hath bloodlessly essayed:\nDreams and illusions beacon from its keep.\nBut at the gate an Angel bares his blade;\nAnd tales are told of those who thought to gain\nAt dawn its ramparts; but when evening fell\nFar off they saw each fading pinnacle\nLit with wild lightnings from the heaven of pain;\nYet there two souls, whom life\u2019s perversities\nHad mocked with want in plenty, tears in mirth,\nMight meet in dreams, ungarmented of earth,\nAnd drain Joy\u2019s awful chalice to the lees."}
