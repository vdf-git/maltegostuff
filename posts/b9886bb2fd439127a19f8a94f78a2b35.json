{"subject": "The Story Of Bonnie And Clyde", "text": "You've read the story of Jesse James\nOf how he lived and died;\n      If you're still in need\n      Of something to read,\nHere's the story of Bonnie and Clyde.\n\nNow Bonnie and Clyde are the Barrow gang,\nI'm sure you all have read\n      How they rob and steal\n      And those who squeal\nAre usually found dying or dead.\n\nThere's lots of untruths to these write-ups;\nThey're not so ruthless as that;\n      Their nature is raw;\n      They hate all the law\nThe stool pigeons, spotters, and rats.\n\nThey call them cold-blooded killers;\nThey say they are heartless and mean;\n      But I say this with pride,\n      That I once knew Clyde\nWhen he was honest and upright and clean.\n\nBut the laws fooled around,\nKept taking him down\nAnd locking him up in a cell,\n      Till he said to me,\n      'I'll never be free,\nSo I'll meet a few of them in hell.'\n\nThe road was so dimly lighted;\nThere were no highway signs to guide;\n      But they made up their minds\n      If all roads were blind,\nThey wouldn't give up till they died.\n\nThe road gets dimmer and dimmer;\nSometimes you can hardly see;\n      But it's fight, man to man,\n      And do all you can,\nFor they know they can never be free.\n\nFrom heart-break some people have suffered;\nFrom weariness some people have died;\n      But take it all in all,\n      Our troubles are small\nTill we get like Bonnie and Clyde.\n\nIf a policeman is killed in Dallas,\nAnd they have no clue or guide;\n      If they can't find a fiend,\n      They just wipe their slate clean\nAnd hand it on Bonnie and Clyde.\n\nThere's two crimes committed in America\nNot accredited to the Barrow mob;\n      They had no hand\n      In the kidnap demand,\nNor the Kansas City depot job.\n\nA newsboy once said to his buddy;\n'I wish old Clyde would get jumped;\n      In these awful hard times\n      We'd make a few dimes\nIf five or six cops would get bumped.'\n\nThe police haven't got the report yet,\nBut Clyde called me up today;\n      He said, 'Don't start any fights\n      We aren't working nights\nWe're joining the NRA.'\n\nFrom Irving to West Dallas viaduct\nIs known as the Great Divide,\n      Where the women are kin,\n      And the men are men,\nAnd they won't 'stool' on Bonnie and Clyde.\n\nIf they try to act like citizens\nAnd rent them a nice little flat,\n      About the third night\n      They're invited to fight\nBy a sub-gun's rat-tat-tat.\n\nThey don't think they're too tough or desperate,\nThey know that the law always wins;\n      They've been shot at before,\n      But they do not ignore\nThat death is the wages of sin.\n\nSome day they'll go down together;\nAnd they'll bury them side by side;\n      To few it'll be grief\n      To the law a relief\nBut it's death for Bonnie and Clyde."}
