{"subject": "Frankenstein's Monster", "text": "I built a living creature with every body part that I could find.\nI had no idea that I was giving him a psychopathic mind.\nHe has a flat head, green skin and bolts in his neck.\nHe escaped from my lab and he's on a violent trek.\n\nHe has killed ten men, eight women and even a little boy.\nThe villagers are after my creature because he must be destroyed.\nWhen I stitched him together, I didn't know that he would kill.\nAll I wanted to do was create life and now misery is what I feel.\n\nMy creature will continue his killing spree, there's no doubt.\nSurprisingly he just returned to my lab and I blew his brains out.\nIt's great that he's dead because his carnage was as deadly as a disease.\nI'm responsible for my creature's murders and I'll surrender to the authorities."}
