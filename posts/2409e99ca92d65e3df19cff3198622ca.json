{"subject": "Zacchaeus", "text": "To whom the heavy burden clings,\nIt yet may serve him like a staff;\nOne day the cross will break in wings,\nThe sinner laugh a holy laugh.\n\nThe dwarfed Zacchaeus climbed a tree,\nHis humble stature set him high;\nThe Lord the little man did see\nWho sought the great man passing by.\n\nUp to the tree he came, and stopped:\n'To-day,' he said, 'with thee I bide.'\nA spirit-shaken fruit he dropped,\nRipe for the Master, at his side.\n\nSure never host with gladder look\nA welcome guest home with him bore!\nThen rose the Satan of rebuke\nAnd loudly spake beside the door:\n\n'This is no place for holy feet;\nSinners should house and eat alone!\nThis man sits in the stranger's seat\nAnd grinds the faces of his own!'\n\nOutspoke the man, in Truth's own might:\n'Lord, half my goods I give the poor;\nIf one I've taken more than right\nWith four I make atonement sure!'\n\n'Salvation here is entered in;\nThis man indeed is Abraham's son!'\nSaid he who came the lost to win-\nAnd saved the lost whom he had won"}
