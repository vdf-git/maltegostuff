{"subject": "A Canadian Summer Evening", "text": "The rose-tints have faded from out of the West,\nFrom the Mountain\u2019s high peak, from the river\u2019s broad breast.\nAnd, silently shadowing valley and rill,\nThe twilight steals noiselessly over the hill.\nBehold, in the blue depths of ether afar,\nNow softly emerging each glittering star;\nWhile, later, the moon, placid, solemn and bright,\nFloods earth with her tremulous, silvery light. \n\nHush! list to the Whip-poor-will\u2019s soft plaintive notes,\nAs up from the valley the lonely sound floats,\nInhale the sweet breath of yon shadowy wood\nAnd the wild flowers blooming in hushed solitude.\nStart not at the whispering, \u2019tis but the breeze,\nLow rustling, \u2019mid maple and lonely pine trees,\nOr willows and alders that fringe the dark tide\nWhere canoes of the red men oft silently glide. \n\nSee, rising from out of that copse, dark and damp,\nThe fire-flies, each bearing a flickering lamp!\nLike meteors, gleaming and streaming, they pass\nO\u2019er hillside and meadow, and dew-laden grass,\nContrasting with ripple on river and stream,\nAlternately playing in shadow and beam,\nTill fullness of beauty fills hearing and sight\nThroughout the still hours of a calm summer\u2019s night."}
