{"subject": "In Memoriam -  Francis Cowley Burnand, 1836-1917", "text": "EDITOR OF 'PUNCH,' 1880-1906\n\nHail and Farewell, dear Brother of the Pen,\nMaker of sunshine for the minds of men,\nLord of bright cheer and master of our hearts--\nWhat plaint is fit when such a friend departs?\nNot with mere ceremonial words of woe\nCome we to mourn--you would not have it so;\nBut with our memories stored with joyous fun,\nYour constant largesse till your life was done,\nWith quips, that flashed through frequent twists and bends,\nCaught from the common intercourse of friends;\nAnd gay allusions gayer for the zest\nOf one who hurt no friend and spared no jest.\nWhat arts were yours that taught you to indite\nWhat all men thought, but only you could write!\n\nThat wrung from gloom itself a fleeting smile;\nRippled with laughter but refrained from guile;\nLed you to prick some bladder of conceit\nOr trip intrusive folly's blundering feet,\nWhile wisdom at your call came down to earth,\nUnbent awhile and gave a hand to mirth!\n\nYou too had pondered mid your jesting strife\nThe deeper issues of our mortal life;\nGuided to God by faith no doubt could dim,\nYou fought your fight and left the rest to Him,\nContent to set your heart on things above\nAnd rule your days by laughter and by love.\n\nRest in our memories! You are guarded there\nBy those who knew you as you lived and were.\nThere mid our Happy Thoughts you take your stand,\nA sun-girt shade, and light that shadow-land."}
