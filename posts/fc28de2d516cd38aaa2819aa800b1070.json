{"subject": "Prepare The House", "text": "Prepare the house, kind friends, drape it and deck it\nWith leaves and blossoms fair;\nThrow open doors and windows, and call hither\nThe sunshine and soft air. \n\nLet all the house, from floor to ceiling, look\nIts noblest and its best; \nFor it may chance that soon may come to me\nA most imperial guest \n\nA prouder visitor than ever yet\nHas crossed my threshold o'er,\nOne wearing a royal sceptre and a crown\nShall enter at my door; \n\nShall deign, perchance, sit at my board an hour,\nAnd break with me my bread;\nSuffer, perchance, this night my honored roof\nShelter his kingly head. \n\nAnd if, ere comes the sun again, he bid me\nArise without delay,\nAnd follow him a journey to his kingdom\nUnknown and far away; \n\nAnd in the gray light of the dawning morn\nWe pass out from my door,\nMy guest and I, silent, without farewell,\nAnd to return no more, \u2013 \n\nWeep not, kind friends, I pray; not with vain tears\nLet your glad eyes grow dim;\nRemember that my house was all prepared,\nAnd that I welcomed him."}
