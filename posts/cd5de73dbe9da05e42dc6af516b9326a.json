{"subject": "Talking (And Singing) Of The Nordic Man", "text": "I\n\nBehold, my child, the Nordic man,\nAnd be as like him, as you can;\nHis legs are long, his mind is slow,\nHis hair is lank and made of tow.\nII\n\nAnd here we have the Alpine Race:\nOh! What a broad and foolish face!\nHis skin is of a dirty yellow.\nHe is a most unpleasant fellow.\nIII\n\nThe most degraded of them all\nMediterranean we call.\nHis hair is crisp, and even curls,\nAnd he is saucy with the girls."}
