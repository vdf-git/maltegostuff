{"subject": "The Buffalo Coat", "text": "I see him moving, in his legendary fleece, \nBetween the superhighway and an Algonquin stone axe; \nBetween the wild tribes, in their lost heat, \nAnd the dark blizzard of my Grandfather's coat; \nCold with the outdoor cold caught in the curls, \nSmelling of the world before the poll tax. \n\nAnd between the new macadam and the Scalp Act \nThey got him by the short hair; had him clipped \nWho once was wild\u2014and all five senses wild\u2014 \nPrinting the wild with his hoof's inflated script \nBefore the times was money in the bank, \nBefore it was a crime to be so mild. \n\nBut history is a fact, and moves on feet \nSharper than his, toward wallows deeper than. \nAnd the myth that covered all his moving parts, \nGrandfather's time had turned into a coat; \nAnd what kept warm then, in the true world's cold \nIs old and cold in a world his death began."}
