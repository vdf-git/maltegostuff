{"subject": "Lament Of Mary, Queen Of Scots", "text": "NOW Nature hangs her mantle green\nOn every blooming tree,\nAnd spreads her sheets o' daisies white\nOut o'er the grassy lea;\nNow Phoebus cheers the crystal streams,\nAnd glads the azure skies;\nBut nought can glad the weary wight\nThat fast in durance lies.\nNow laverocks wake the merry morn\nAloft on dewy wing;\nThe merle, in his noontide bow'r,\nMakes woodland echoes ring;\nThe mavis wild wi' mony a note,\nSings drowsy day to rest:\nIn love and freedom they rejoice,\nWi' care nor thrall opprest.\nNow blooms the lily by the bank,\nThe primrose down the brae;\nThe hawthorn's budding in the glen,\nAnd milk-white is the slae:\nThe meanest hind in fair Scotland\nMay rove their sweets amang;\nBut I, the Queen of a' Scotland,\nMaun lie in prison strang.\nI was the Queen o' bonie France,\nWhere happy I hae been;\nFu' lightly raise I in the morn,\nAs blythe lay down at e'en:\nAnd I'm the sov'reign of Scotland,\nAnd mony a traitor there;\nYet here I lie in foreign bands,\nAnd never-ending care.\nBut as for thee, thou false woman,\nMy sister and my fae,\nGrim Vengeance yet shall whet a sword\nThat thro' thy soul shall gae;\nThe weeping blood in woman's breast\nWas never known to thee;\nNor th' balm that draps on wounds of woe\nFrae woman's pitying e'e.\nMy son! my son! may kinder stars\nUpon thy fortune shine;\nAnd may those pleasures gild thy reign,\nThat ne'er wad blink on mine!\nGod keep thee frae thy mother's faes,\nOr turn their hearts to thee:\nAnd where thou meet'st thy mother's friend,\nRemember him for me!\nO! soon, to me, may Summer suns\nNae mair light up the morn!\nNae mair to me the Autumn winds\nWave o'er the yellow corn?\nAnd, in the narrow house of death,\nLet Winter round me rave;\nAnd the next flow'rs that deck the Spring,\nBloom on my peaceful grave!"}
