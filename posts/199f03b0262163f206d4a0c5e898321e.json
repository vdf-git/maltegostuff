{"subject": "Inflection", "text": "They are white planets in a galaxy, these wheels \nof cheese\u2014before the fungi knobble the skin, cobble \nsome resistance in the rind. Deep in the cool \ncaves of Auvergne, a nun sets the circles on shelves \nso their surfaces will stain, sheen, stipple, \nshade \u2026 while above her, a Latin chant \nfolds many women in one voice. If glass \nwere music, could it sound like this? \nHow can we call those words \nhuman, when they\u2019ve flown so far \nfrom our commerce, our marketplace? \nEvery mold that steeps the skin is local: grafted \nand endangered as the dead letters become notes \nfloating still in vowels from the nuns\u2019 grille"}
