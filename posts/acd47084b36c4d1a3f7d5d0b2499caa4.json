I will teach my baby well \nTo understand this scary world. \nLife is our baby and my man. \nTis is our first, don't you see\u2014 \nTime awaits my baby and I. \nso excited that this man of mine is holding me closely \nEach night after a long day at my busiest job. \nMy baby, my man, and I, \nOur beautiful baby will be born soon. \nThis bonds us closer, my man and I. \nMy mother . . . his mother as proud as can be for him, \nAnd me, my mom, my baby, and me, Tanya . . .  \nThank you, God's blessing to you. \nPeace be unto you, your man, and your unborn child."}
