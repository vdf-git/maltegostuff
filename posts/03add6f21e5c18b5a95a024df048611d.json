{"subject": "The Universe", "text": "When this Universe was formed,\nHydrogen,Helium,Lithium and Beryllium,\nMade the stars that the night sky is adorned\nThey exploded all elements then done.\n\nOnly way all other elements can be made,\nSo each of us is considered star stuff,\nThe Earth we stand on and air we breathe,\nFusion it is called making elements in a puff.\n\nA puff of high heat and pressure to create,\nAll we see in our night sky,\nGalaxies, Stars, Planets, all so great,\nNebulae that will become stars bye and bye.\n\nAll so happenstance from the Big Bang,\nThat created everything that we see,\nA lot we have yet to name,\nBut the elements created made you and me.\n\nLight travels 186,282 miles per second,\nAnd 13.8 billion years furtherest we can see,\nAnd Astronomy is a calling that still beckoned,\nFor so many a science a vocation to be.\n\nFor any thinking mind this should preclude,\nDeities of any kind,\nNo one waved his hand to include,\nMaking anything, that's just so blind.\n\nLife has been found 3.8 billion years past,\nOn Earth that is 4.6 billion years old,\nNot that i wish to be an iconoclast,\nBut think for yourself not just what is told!\n\nScience of Paleontology does exist,\nFrom many years of hard work,\nBy smart people trying to expel the mist,\nCreated for control by some jerk!\n\nif only people would not accept the belief,\nTouted by parasitic charlatans for profit,\nAnd do their own thinking for some relief,\nAway from those dealing in fear from a pulpit!"}
