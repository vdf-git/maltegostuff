{"subject": "Never Again The Same", "text": "Speaking of sunsets,\nlast night's was shocking.\nI mean, sunsets aren't supposed to frighten you, are they?\nWell, this one was terrifying.\nPeople were screaming in the streets.\nSure, it was beautiful, but far too beautiful.\nIt wasn't natural.\nOne climax followed another and then another\nuntil your knees went weak\nand you couldn't breathe.\nThe colors were definitely not of this world,\npeaches dripping opium,\npandemonium of tangerines,\ninferno of irises,\nPlutonian emeralds,\nall swirling and churning, swabbing,\nlike it was playing with us,\nlike we were nothing,\nas if our whole lives were a preparation for this,\nthis for which nothing could have prepared us\nand for which we could not have been less prepared.\nThe mockery of it all stung us bitterly.\nAnd when it was finally over\nwe whimpered and cried and howled.\nAnd then the streetlights came on as always\nand we looked into one another's eyes?\nancient caves with still pools\nand those little transparent fish\nwho have never seen even one ray of light.\nAnd the calm that returned to us\nwas not even our own."}
