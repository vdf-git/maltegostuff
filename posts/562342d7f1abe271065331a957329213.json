{"subject": "Sonnet 35 - If I Leave All For Thee, Wilt Thou Exchange", "text": "XXXV\n\nIf I leave all for thee, wilt thou exchange\nAnd be all to me? Shall I never miss\nHome-talk and blessing and the common kiss\nThat comes to each in turn, nor count it strange,\nWhen I look up, to drop on a new range\nOf walls and floors, another home than this?\nNay, wilt thou fill that place by me which is\nFilled by dead eyes too tender to know change?\nThat 's hardest. If to conquer love, has tried,\nTo conquer grief, tries more, as all things prove;\nFor grief indeed is love and grief beside.\nAlas, I have grieved sol am hard to love.\nYet love me\u2014wilt thou? Open thine heart wide,\nAnd fold within the wet wings of thy dove."}
