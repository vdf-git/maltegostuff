{"subject": "To My Wife", "text": "And does the heart grow old? You know   \nIn the indiscriminate green\nOf summer or in earliest snow\nA landscape is another scene,\n\nInchoate and anonymous,\nAnd every rock and bush and drift   \nAs our affections alter us\nWill alter with the season's shift.\n\nSo love by love we come at last,\nAs through the exclusions of a rhyme,   \nOr the exactions of a past,\nTo the simplicity of time,\n\nThe antiquity of grace, where yet   \nWe live in terror and delight   \nWith love as quiet as regret   \nAnd love like anger in the night."}
