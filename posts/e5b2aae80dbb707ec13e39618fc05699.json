{"subject": "Shakespeare And Cervantes", "text": "Obit 23rd April 1616\n\nIs it not strange that on this common date,\nTwo titans of their age, aye of all Time,\nTogether should renounce this mortal state,\nAnd rise like gods, unsullied and sublime?\nShould mutually render up the ghost,\nAnd hand n hand join Jove's celestial host?\n\nWhat wondrous welcome from the scribes on high!\nHomer and Virgil would be waiting there;\nPlato and Aristotle standing nigh;\nPetrarch and Dante greet the peerless pair:\nAnd as in harmony they make their bow,\nHorace might quip: \"Great timing, you'll allow.\"\n\nImagine this transcendant team arrive\nAt some hilarious banquet of the gods!\nTheir nations battled when they were alive,\nAnd they were bitter foes - but what's the odd?\nActor and soldier, happy hand in hand,\nBy death close-linked, like loving brothers stand.\n\nBut how diverse! Our Will had gold and gear,\nChattels and land, the starshine of success;\nThe bleak Castilian fought with casque and spear,\nPassing his life in prisons - more or less.\nThe Bard of Avon was accounted rich;\nCervantes often bedded in a ditch.\n\nYet when I slough this flesh, if I could meet\nBy sweet, fantastic fate one of these two,\nIn languorous Elysian retreat,\nWhich would I choose? Fair reader, which would you?\nWell, though our William more divinely wrote,\nBy gad! the lousy Spaniard has my vote."}
