{"subject": "The Little Dancers", "text": "Lonely, save for a few faint stars, the sky\nDreams; and lonely, below, the little street\nInto its gloom retires, secluded and shy.\nScarcely the dumb roar enters this soft retreat;\nAnd all is dark, save where come flooding rays\nFrom a tavern--window; there, to the brisk measure\nOf an organ that down in an alley merrily plays,\nTwo children, all alone and no one by,\nHolding their tattered frocks, thro' an airy maze\nOf motion lightly threaded with nimble feet\nDance sedately; face to face they gaze,\nTheir eyes shining, grave with a perfect pleasure."}
