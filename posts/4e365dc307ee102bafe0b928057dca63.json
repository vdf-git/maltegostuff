{"subject": "Memento Vivere", "text": "When life was young, in pensive guise\nI made it a fantastic glory,\nTo pause and sentimentalize\nO'er every sad 'Memento Mori.'\nDear fourscore friend! in their dull place\nHow gladlier now I turn to thee,\nWith all thy cheery wit and grace,\nThou bright 'Memento Vivere.'"}
