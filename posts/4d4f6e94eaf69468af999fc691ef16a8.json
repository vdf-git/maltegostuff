{"subject": "Bourke", "text": "I\u2019ve followed all my tracks and ways,from old bark school to Leicester Square,\nI\u2019ve been right back to boyhood\u2019s days, and found no light or pleasure there.\nBut every dream and every track\u2014and there were many that I knew\u2014\nThey all lead on, or they lead back, to Bourke in Ninety-one, and two. \nNo sign that green grass ever grew in scrubs that blazed beneath the sun;\nThe plains were dust in Ninety-two, that baked to bricks in Ninety-one.\nOn glaring iron-roofs of Bourke, the scorching, blinding sandstorms blew,\nAnd there was nothing beautiful in Ninety-one and Ninety-two. \n\nSave grit and generosity of hearts that broke and healed again\u2014\nThe hottest drought that ever blazed could never parch the hearts of men;\nAnd they were men in spite of all, and they were straight, and they were true,\nThe hat went round at trouble\u2019s call, in Ninety-one and Ninety-two. \n\nThey drank, when all is said and done, they gambled, and their speech was rough\u2014\nYou\u2019d only need to say of one\u2014\u2018He was my mate!\u2019 that was enough.\nTo hint a bushman was not white, nor to his Union straight and true,\nWould mean a long and bloody fight in Ninety-one and Ninety-two. \n\nThe yard behind the Shearers\u2019 Arms was reckoned best of battle grounds,\nAnd there in peace and quietness they fought their ten or fifteen rounds;\nAnd then they washed the blood away, and then shook hands, as strong men do\u2014\nAnd washed away the bitterness\u2014in Ninety-one and Ninety-two. \n\nThe Army on the grand old creek was mighty in those days gone by,\nFor they had sisters who could shriek, and brothers who could testify;\nAnd by the muddy waterholes, they tackled sin till all was blue\u2014\nThey took our bobs and damned our souls in Ninety-one and Ninety-two. \n\nBy shanty bars and shearing sheds, they took their toll and did their work\u2014 \nBut now and then they lost their heads, and raved of hotter hells than Bourke:\nThe only message from the dead that ever came distinctly through\u2014\nWas\u2014\u2018Send my overcoat to hell\u2019\u2014it came to Bourke in Ninety-two. \n\nI know they drank, and fought, and died\u2014some fighting fiends on blazing tracks\u2014\nI don\u2019t remember that they lied, or crawled behind each others\u2019 backs;\nI don\u2019t remember that they loafed, or left a mate to battle through\u2014\nAh! men knew how to stick to men in Ninety-one and Ninety-two. \n\nThey\u2019re scattered wide and scattered far\u2014by fan-like tracks, north, east, and west\u2014\nThe cruel New Australian star drew off the bravest and the best.\nThe Cape and Klondyke claim their bones, the streets of London damned a few,\nAnd jingo-cursed Australia mourns for Ninety-one and Ninety-two. \n\nFor ever westward in the land, Australians hear\u2014and will not heed\u2014\nThe murmur of the board-room, and the sure and stealthy steps of greed\u2014\nBourke was a fortress on the track! and garrisons were grim and true\nTo hold the spoilers from Out Back, in Ninety-one and Ninety-two. \n\nI hear it in the ridges lone, and in the dread drought-stricken wild\u2014\nI hear at times a woman\u2019s moan\u2014the whimper of a hungry child:\nAnd\u2014let the cynics say the word: \u2018a godless gang, a drunken crew\u2019\u2014\nBut these were things I never heard in Ninety-one and Ninety-two. \nThey say that things have changed out there, and western towns have altered quite:\nThey don\u2019t know how to drink and swear, they\u2019ve half forgotten how to fight;\nThey\u2019ve almost lost the strength to trust, the faith in mateship to be true\u2014\nThe heart that grew in drought and dust in Ninety-one and Ninety-two. \nWe\u2019ve learned to laugh the bitter laugh since then\u2014we\u2019ve travelled, you and I;\nThe sneaking little paragraph, the dirty trick, the whispered lie\nAre known to us\u2014the little men\u2014whose souls are rotten through and through\u2014\nWe called them scabs and crawlers then, in Ninety-one and Ninety-two. \n\nAnd could I roll the summers back, or bring the dead time on again;\nOr from the grave or world-wide track, call back to Bourke the vanished men,\nWith mind content I\u2019d go to sleep, and leave those mates to judge me true,\nAnd leave my name to Bourke to keep\u2014the Bourke of Ninety-one and two."}
