{"subject": "Last Trams", "text": "I\nTHAT street washed with violet \nWrites like a tablet \nOf living here; that pavement \nIs the metal embodiment \nOf living here; those terraces \nFilled with dumb presences \nLobbed over mattresses, \nLusts and repentances, \nArdours and solaces, \nPassions and hatreds \nAnd love in brass bedsteads . . . \nLost now in emptiness \nDeep now in darkness \nNothing but nakedness, \nRails like a ribbon \nAnd sickness of carbon \nDying in distances. \nII\nTHEN, from the skeletons of trams, \nGazing at lighted rooms, you'll find \nThe black and R\u00f6ntgen diagrams \nOf window-plants across the blind \nThat print their knuckleduster sticks, \nTheir buds of gum, against the light \nLike negatives of candlesticks \nWhose wicks are lit by fluorite; \nAnd shapes look out, or bodies pass, \nBetween the darkness and the flare, \nBetween the curtain and the glass, \nOf men and women moving there. \nSo through the moment's needle-eye, \nLike phantoms in the window-chink, \nTheir faces brush you as they fly, \nFixed in the shutters of a blink; \nBut whose they are, intent on what, \nWho knows? They rattle into void, \nStars of a film without a plot, \nSnippings of idiot celluloid."}
