{"subject": "The Dole Of The King's Daughter (Breton)", "text": "Seven stars in the still water,\nAnd seven in the sky;\nSeven sins on the King's daughter,\nDeep in her soul to lie. \n\nRed roses are at her feet,\n(Roses are red in her red-gold hair)\nAnd O where her bosom and girdle meet\nRed roses are hidden there. \n\nFair is the knight who lieth slain\nAmid the rush and reed,\nSee the lean fishes that are fain\nUpon dead men to feed. \n\nSweet is the page that lieth there,\n(Cloth of gold is goodly prey,)\nSee the black ravens in the air,\nBlack, O black as the night are they. \n\nWhat do they there so stark and dead?\n(There is blood upon her hand)\nWhy are the lilies flecked with red?\n(There is blood on the river sand.) \n\nThere are two that ride from the south and east,\nAnd two from the north and west,\nFor the black raven a goodly feast,\nFor the King's daughter rest. \n\nThere is one man who loves her true,\n(Red, O red, is the stain of gore!)\nHe hath duggen a grave by the darksome yew,\n(One grave will do for four.) \n\nNo moon in the still heaven,\nIn the black water none,\nThe sins on her soul are seven,\nThe sin upon his is one."}
