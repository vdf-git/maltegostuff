{"subject": "Old David Smail", "text": "He dreamed away his hours in school;\nHe sat with such an absent air,\nThe master reckoned him a fool,\nAnd gave him up in dull despair.\n\nWhen other lads were making hay\nYou'd find him loafing by the stream;\nHe'd take a book and slip away,\nAnd just pretend to fish . . . and dream.\n\nHis brothers passed him in the race;\nThey climbed the hill and clutched the prize.\nHe did not seem to heed, his face\nWas tranquil as the evening skies.\n\nHe lived apart, he spoke with few;\nAbstractedly through life he went;\nOh, what he dreamed of no one knew,\nAnd yet he seemed to be content.\n\nI see him now, so old and gray,\nHis eyes with inward vision dim;\nAnd though he faltered on the way,\nSomehow I almost envied him.\n\nAt last beside his bed I stood:\n\"And is Life done so soon?\" he sighed;\n\"It's been so rich, so full, so good,\nI've loved it all . . .\" -- and so he died."}
