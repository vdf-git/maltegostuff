{"subject": "Address And Welcome To J. B. Gough", "text": "Welcome! Oh, welcome! in thy course of fame-\nThrough rolling clouds of smoke and lurid flame,\nBelched from a hundred murky piles-at last\nThou com'st, and scared Intemperance stands aghast.\nTo charm the adder deaf, we lack the power-\nThy potent aid we crave, in this the hour\nAnd power of darkness. Wisely thou can'st charm-\nUnstop the serpent's ear, his sting disarm;\nCry, cry aloud, and spare not; lift on high\nThy voice of power, till quailing demons fly\nTheir wonted haunts; extinguish thou and quell,\nWith waves of eloquence, the fires of hell-\nThose fires that scorch the tongue and fire the brain;\nThat feed Death's engines, linked to Ruin's train,\nDragging the inebriate, lost, through horrors dire,\nTill 'neath the grinding wheels the wretch expire!\nTo red Crimea's corse-encumbered dells,\nWhere war with sickness, death, and carnage dwells,\nAll eyes are turned; all ears to hear are strained\nOf fierce assault, and 'leaguered fortress gained-\nBut higher, holier, stern, though bloodless war,\n'Gainst foe more terrible than Russia's Czar,\nThou hast proclaimed-God shield thee in the fight!-\nHis forts and towers of strength, raze, raze them quite!\nAccept the deepest, dearest thanks of those\nWho, sharing not the sin, yet share the woes\nAnd shame incurred by lost degraded ones-\nIntemperate fathers, mothers, husbands, sons!\n'Who winneth souls is wise'-in God's own might\nGo on; thy path shall like the morning light\nWax brighter, till the noon of perfect day\nShall blind, and scorch, and scare the fiend away!"}
