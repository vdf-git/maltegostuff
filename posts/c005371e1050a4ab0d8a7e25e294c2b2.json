{"subject": "Song", "text": "You are as gold \nas the half-ripe grain \nthat merges to gold again, \nas white as the white rain \nthat beats through \nthe half-opened flowers \nof the great flower tufts \nthick on the black limbs \nof an Illyrian apple bough.\n\nCan honey distill such fragrance \nAs your bright hair\u00f3\nFor your face is as fair as rain, \nyet as rain that lies clear \non white honey-comb,\nlends radiance to the white wax, \nso your hair on your brow \ncasts light for a shadow."}
