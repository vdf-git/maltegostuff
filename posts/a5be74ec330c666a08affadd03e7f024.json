{"subject": "Magpiety", "text": "You pull over to the shoulder\n         of the two-lane\nroad and sit for a moment wondering\n         where you were going\nin such a hurry. The valley is burned\n         out, the oaks\ndream day and night of rain\n         that never comes.\nAt noon or just before noon\n         the short shadows\nare gray and hold what little\n         life survives.\nIn the still heat the engine\n         clicks, although\nthe real heat is hours ahead.\n         You get out and step\ncautiously over a low wire\n         fence and begin\nthe climb up the yellowed hill.\n         A hundred feet\nahead the trunks of two\n         fallen oaks\nrust; something passes over\n         them, a lizard\nperhaps or a trick of sight.\n         The next tree\nyou pass is unfamiliar,\n         the trunk dark,\nas black as an olive's; the low\n         branches stab\nout, gnarled and dull: a carob\n         or a Joshua tree.\nA sudden flaring-up ahead,\n         a black-winged\nbird rises from nowhere,\n         white patches\nunderneath its wings, and is gone.\n         You hear your own\nbreath catching in your ears,\n         a roaring, a sea\nsound that goes on and on\n         until you lean\nforward to place both hands\n        -- fingers spread --\ninto the bleached grasses\n         and let your knees\nslowly down. Your breath slows\n         and you know\nyou're back in central\n         California\non your way to San Francisco\n         or the coastal towns\nwith their damp sea breezes\n         you haven't\neven a hint of. But first\n         you must cross\nthe Pacheco Pass. People\n         expect you, and yet\nyou remain, still leaning forward\n         into the grasses\nthat if you could hear them\n         would tell you\nall you need to know about\n         the life ahead. \n\n        .    .    .\n\nOut of a sense of modesty\n         or to avoid the truth\nI've been writing in the second\n         person, but in truth\nit was I, not you, who pulled\n         the green Ford\nover to the side of the road\n         and decided to get\nup that last hill to look\n         back at the valley\nhe'd come to call home.\n         I can't believe\nthat man, only thirty-two,\n         less than half\nmy age, could be the person\n         fashioning these lines.\nThat was late July of '60.\n         I had heard\nall about magpies, how they\n         snooped and meddled\nin the affairs of others, not\n         birds so much\nas people. If you dared\n         to remove a wedding\nring as you washed away\n         the stickiness of love\nor the cherished odors of another\n         man or woman,\nas you turned away\n         from the mirror\nhaving admired your new-found\n         potency -- humming\n\"My Funny Valentine\" or\n         \"Body and Soul\" --\nto reach for a rough towel\n         or some garment\non which to dry yourself,\n         he would enter\nthe open window behind you\n         that gave gratefully\nonto the fields and the roads\n         bathed in dawn --\nhe, the magpie -- and snatch\n         up the ring\nin his hard beak and shoulder\n         his way back\ninto the currents of the world\n         on his way\nto the only person who could\n         change your life:\na king or a bride or an old woman\n         asleep on her porch. \n\n        .    .    .\n\nCan you believe the bird\n         stood beside you\njust long enough, though far\n         smaller than you\nbut fearless in a way\n         a man or woman\ncould never be? An apparition\n         with two dark\nand urgent eyes and motions\n         so quick and precise\nthey were barely motions at all?\n         When he was gone\nyou turned, alarmed by the rustling\n         of oily feathers\nand the curious pungency,\n         and were sure\nyou'd heard him say the words\n         that could explain\nthe meaning of blond grasses\n         burning on a hillside\nbeneath the hands of a man\n         in the middle of\nhis life caught in the posture\n         of prayer. I'd\nheard that a magpie could talk,\n         so I waited\nfor the words, knowing without\n         the least doubt\nwhat he'd do, for up ahead\n         an old woman\nwaited on her wide front porch.\n         My children\nbehind her house played\n         in a silted pond\npoking sticks at the slow\n         carp that flashed\nin the fallen sunlight. You\n         are thirty-two\nonly once in your life, and though\n         July comes\ntoo quickly, you pray for\n         the overbearing\nheat to pass. It does, and\n         the year turns\nbefore it holds still for\n         even a moment.\nBeyond the last carob\n         or Joshua tree\nthe magpie flashes his sudden\n         wings; a second\nflames and vanishes into the pale\n         blue air.\nJuly 23, 1960.\n         I lean down\ncloser to hear the burned grasses\n         whisper all I\nneed to know. The words rise\n         around me, separate\nand finite. A yellow dust\n         rises and stops\ncaught in the noon's driving light.\n         Three ants pass\nacross the back of my reddened\n         right hand.\nEverything is speaking or singing.\n         We're still here."}
