{"subject": "God's Plan", "text": "God showed the way for man to live, \nWhen in Africa he did compose \nHead shaped features that are unique, \nWith this story I now disclose. Its mouth is closed for you to see, \nChrist's Communion is the scene. \nThe bread's his foot you walk in life, \nToward Mt. Sinai is God's scheme. The Red Sea as your blood force split- \nWhere God gave Moses his Commands. \nObey those Ten they're meant for you, \nWalk with Christ to the Holy Land. God's Holy Land signs Paradise, \nWith life rooted in God's plan. \nDon't disobey and journey left, \nThe Devil's Crete will claim your hand. Christ said his meat was to obey \nThe will of God our Father. \nCommunion meat becomes your fete, \nWith Christ's footsteps as your tether."}
