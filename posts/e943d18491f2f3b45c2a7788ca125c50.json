{"subject": "The Judgement Of Venus", "text": "When Kneller's works, of various grace,\nWere to fair Venus shown, \nThe Goddess spied in every face\nSome features of her own.\n\nJust so, (and pointing with her hand)\nSo shone, says she, my eyes,\nWhen from two goddesses I gain'd\nAn apple for a prize.\n\nWhen in the glass and river too\nMy face I lately view'd,\nSuch was I, if the glass be true,\nIf true the crystal flood.\n\nIn colours of this glorious kind\nApelles painted me;\nMy hair, thus flowing with the wind\nSprung from my native sea.\n\nLike this disorder'd, wild, forlorn,\nBig with ten thousand fears,\nThee, my Adonis, did I mourn\nE'en beautiful in tears.\n\nBut viewing Myra placed apart,\nI fear, says she, I fear,\nAppelles, that Sir Godfrey's art\nHas far surpass'd thine here:\n\nOr I, a goddess of the skies,\nBy Mary am undone,\nAnd must resign to her the prize,\nThe apple, which I won.\n\nBut soon as she had Myra seen,\nMajestically fair,\nThe sparkling eye, the look serene,\nThe gay and easy air.\n\nWith fiery emulation fill'd\nThe wondering goddess cried,\nApelles must to Kneller yield,\nOr Venus must to Hyde."}
