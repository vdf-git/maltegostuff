{"subject": "Easton's Beach", "text": "LAST night I saw a city by the sea,\nOutlined in sparks of fire;\nThose wreathed lamps made all a fantasy -\nArch, dome and spire.\n\nI saw above the waters pale and gray,\nThe pale moon stand,\nI heard, but faint and sweet and far away,\nA martial band.\n\nThe distant voices in the streets, the sound\nOf laughter from the towers\nMade where we swam the solitude profound:\nThe sea was ours."}
