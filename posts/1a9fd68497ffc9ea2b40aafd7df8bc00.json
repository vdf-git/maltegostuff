{"subject": "Song V", "text": "To Thee, eternal Defender of all creation,\nI call, frail, commiserate, nowhere secure. \nKeep me in close watch, and in my each anxiety, \nHasten to bring aid to my wretched soul.\n\nWith Thy rod, do but quell the blind flesh\nSo laden with vain, lowly, ill-working lust; \nFor shame it seeks sway o'er its own soul:\nFairer if what's to decay serves what's forever!\n\nAnd ye, cov'tous hosts (Lord God, my Defence), \nShow your heels and take your infamy unending, \nYe who deny God's creation the wealth (whence you \nWere forced) and the praise to thine own Maker.\n\nMy Bliss, my Praise, let them fast feel shame \nWho sing me sweetness of other praise, not Thee. \nWhat hath man not Thine? Yet who in Thy gifts \nBe vain, eternal King, Thy gifts would he lose.\n\nSo happy, so jubilant they who confess\nThat the good be Thine, who seek Thee\nAnd adornment unending, who take pains\nTo love Thee alone full-willing, O Lord.\n\nAye, reckon me in that count, kind Father, \nWhilst here, grant me but mark I'm lowly dust\nAnd, unmatched for a tempest's heavy ordeals, \nMay I know as my strengths thy great mercies.\n\nStill who's content, arrayed yet in mail\nOf adamant, if war long and hard he endures?\nSo I beg: Thou who in battle art Defender,\nTarry not, Peace redeeming, giving unto us Thyself!"}
