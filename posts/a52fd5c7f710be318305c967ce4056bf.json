{"subject": "The Dump", "text": "He died, and I admired \nthe crisp vehemence \nof a lifetime reduced to \nhalf a foot of shelf space. \nBut others came to me saying, \nwe too loved him, let us take you \nto the place of our love. \nSo they showed me \neverything, everything--\na cliff of notebooks \nwith every draft and erasure \nof every poem he \npublished or rejected, \nthatched already \nwith webs of annotation. \nI went in further and saw \na hill of matchcovers \nfrom every bar or restaurant \nhe'd ever entered. Trucks \nbacked up constantly, \npiled with papers, and awaited \nby archivists with shovels; \nforklifts bumped through \ntrough and valley \nto adjust the spillage. \nHere odors of rubbery sweat \nintruded on the pervasive \nsmell of stale paper, \nno doubt from the mound \nof his collected sneakers. \nI clambered up the highest \npile and found myself \nlooking across not history \nbut the vistas of a steaming \nrange of garbage \nreaching to the coast itself. Then \nI lost my footing! and was \ncarried down on a soft \navalanche of letters, paid bills, \nsexual polaroids, and notes \nrefusing invitations, thanking \nfans, resisting scholars. \nIn nightmare I slid, \nno ground to stop me,\n\nuntil I woke at last \nwhere I had napped beside \nthe precious half foot. Beyond that, \nnothing, nothing at all."}
