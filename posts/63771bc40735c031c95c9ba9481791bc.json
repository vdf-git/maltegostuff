{"subject": "The Robber Bridegroom", "text": "(Talk between Bird and Girl)\n\nTurn back. Turn, young lady dear\nA murderer's house you enter here\n\nI was wooed and won little bird\n\n(I have watched them come bright girls\nOut of the rising sun, with curls)\nThe stair is tall the cellar deep\nThe wind coughs in the halls\n\nI never wish to sleep\n\nFrom the ceiling the sky falls\nIt will press you and press you, dear.\n\nIt is my desire to fear\n\n(What a child! she desires her fear)\nThe house is whirling night, the guests\nGrains of dust from the northwest\n\nI do not come for rest\n\nThere is no rest for the dead\n\nReady for the couch of my groom\n\nIn a long room beneath the dew\nWhere the walls embrace and cling.\n\nI wear my wedding ring\n\nHe will cut off your finger\nAnd the blood will linger\n\nLittle bird!"}
