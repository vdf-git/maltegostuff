{"subject": "Time's Revenge", "text": "When I was ten and she fifteen--\nAh, me! how fair I thought her.\nShe treated with disdainful mien\nThe homage that I brought her,\nAnd, in a patronizing way,\nWould of my shy advances say:\n'It's really quite absurd, you see;\nHe's very much too young for me.'\n\nI'm twenty now, she twenty-five--\nWell, well! how old she's growing.\nI fancy that my suit might thrive\nIf pressed again; but, owing\nTo great discrepancy in age,\nHer marked attentions don't engage\nMy young affections, for, you see,\nShe's really quite too old for me."}
