He\nremembered only one thing, the birds, how\nwhen he came in, he had gone around the rooms\nand got them back in their cage, the green one first,\nshe with the bad leg, and then the blue,\nthe one they had hoped was a male\n\nOtherwise? Yes, Fernand, who had talked lispingly of Albers &amp; Angkor Vat.\nHe had left the party without a word. How he got up, got into his coat,\nI do not know. When I saw him, he was at the door, but it did not matter,\nhe was already sliding along the wall of the night, losing himself\nin some crack of the ruins. That it should have been he who said, \"The kingfishers!\nwho cares \nfor their feathers\nnow?\"\n\nHis last words had been, \"The pool is slime.\" Suddenly everyone,\nceasing their talk, sat in a row around him, watched\nthey did not so much hear, or pay attention, they\nwondered, looked at each other, smirked, but listened,\nhe repeated and repeated, could not go beyond his thought\n\"The pool    the kingfishers' feathers were wealth    why \ndid the export stop?\"\n\nIt was then he left \n2\n\nI thought of the E on the stone, and of what Mao said\nla lumiere\"\n                    but the kingfisher\nde l'aurore\"\n                    but the kingfisher flew west\nest devant nous!\n                    he got the color of his breast\n                    from the heat of the setting sun!\n\nThe features are, the feebleness of the feet (syndactylism of the 3rd &amp; 4th digit)\nthe bill, serrated, sometimes a pronounced beak, the wings\nwhere the color is, short and round, the tail\ninconspicuous.\n\nBut not these things were the factors. Not the birds. \nThe legends are\nlegends. Dead, hung up indoors, the kingfisher\nwill not indicate a favoring wind,\nor avert the thunderbolt. Nor, by its nesting,\nstill the waters, with the new year, for seven days.\nIt is true, it does nest with the opening year, but not on the waters.\nIt nests at the end of a tunnel bored by itself in a bank. There,\nsix or eight white and translucent eggs are laid, on fishbones\nnot on bare clay, on bones thrown up in pellets by the birds.\n\n                                                   On these rejectamenta\n(as they accumulate they form a cup-shaped structure) the young are born.\nAnd, as they are fed and grow, this nest of excrement and decayed fish becomes\n                                                              a dripping, fetid mass\n\nMao concluded:\n                   nous devons\n                                       nous lever\n                                                         et agir!\n3\n\nWhen the attentions change / the jungle\nleaps in\n             even the stones are split\n                                             they rive\n\nOr, \nenter\nthat other conqueror we more naturally recognize\nhe so resembles ourselves\n\nBut the E\ncut so rudely on that oldest stone\nsounded otherwise,\nwas differently heard\n\nas, in another time, were treasures used:\n\n(and, later, much later, a fine ear thought\na scarlet coat)\n\n                       \"of green feathers    feet, beaks and eyes\n                        of gold\n\n                       \"animals likewise,\n                        resembling snails\n\n                       \"a large wheel, gold, with figures of unknown four-foots,\n                        and worked with tufts of leaves, weight\n                        3800 ounces\n\n                       \"last, two birds, of thread and featherwork, the quills\n                        gold, the feet\n                        gold, the two birds perched on two reeds\n\n                        gold, the reeds arising from two embroidered mounds,\n                        one yellow, the other\n                        white.\n\n                                     \"And from each reed hung\n                                      seven feathered tassels. \n\nIn this instance, the priests\n(in dark cotton robes, and dirty, \ntheir disheveled hair matted with blood, and flowing wildly\nover their shoulders)\nrush in among the people, calling on them\nto protect their gods\n\nAnd all now is war\nwhere so lately there was peace,\nand the sweet brotherhood, the use\nof tilled fields.\n4\n\nNot one death but many,\nnot accumulation but change, the feed-back proves, the feed-back is\nthe law\n\n                 Into the same river no man steps twice\n                 When fire dies air dies\n                 No one remains, nor is, one\n\nAround an appearance, one common model, we grow up\nmany.
