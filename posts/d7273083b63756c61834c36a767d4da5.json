{"subject": "The Rendezvous", "text": "A pub there is of far renown,\nA pub that seamen know\nIn every street of Sailortown\nOr sea where they in ships go down\nFrom Clyde to Callao.\n\nAnd there they say if a man should wait\nA twelvemonth and a day\nThat all his shipmates soon or late\nWould surely pass that way.\n\nBoth night and noon the door swings wide\nTo the noisy dockside's din,\nBoth night and noon with every tide\nThe sailormen blow in.\n\nThey come with talk of ships and men\nAnd lean upon the bar\nAnd yarn and drink and yarn again\nOf ports both near and far.\n\nBut theirs are ships I never spoke\nAnd trades to me unknown,\nAnd all they see is a grizzled bloke\nThat drinks his drink alone.\n\nThey neither pause nor listen when\nFrom all the oceans home\nBetween the tides the sailormen\nI wait alone for come -\n\nCome in with laughter on their lips\nAnd names I used to know\nAnd speech of men and speech of ships\nForgotten long ago.\n\nNo door swings wide to let them through,\nNo eye but mine can see\nThat all the shipmates ever I knew\nBlow in to drink with me."}
