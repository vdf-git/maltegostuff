{"subject": "How I Got That Name", "text": "I am Marilyn Mei Ling Chin\nOh, how I love the resoluteness\nof that first person singular\nfollowed by that stalwart indicative\nof \"be,\" without the uncertain i-n-g\nof \"becoming.\"Of course,\nthe name had been changed\nsomewhere between Angel Island and the sea,\nwhen my father the paperson\nin the late 1950s\nobsessed with a bombshell blond\ntransliterated \"Mei Ling\" to \"Marilyn.\"\nAnd nobody dared question\nhis initial impulse--for we all know\nlust drove men to greatness,\nnot goodness, not decency.\nAnd there I was, a wayward pink baby,\nnamed after some tragic white woman\nswollen with gin and Nembutal.\nMy mother couldn't pronounce the \"r.\"\nShe dubbed me \"Numba one female offshoot\"\nfor brevity: henceforth, she will live and die\nin sublime ignorance, flanked\nby loving children and the \"kitchen deity.\"\nWhile my father dithers,\na tomcat in Hong Kong trash--\na gambler, a petty thug,\nwho bought a chain of chopsuey joints\nin Piss River, Oregon,\nwith bootlegged Gucci cash.\nNobody dared question his integrity given\nhis nice, devout daughters\nand his bright, industrious sons\nas if filial piety were the standard\nby which all earthly men are measured.\n\n*\n\nOh, how trustworthy our daughters,\nhow thrifty our sons!\nHow we've managed to fool the experts\nin education, statistic and demography--\nWe're not very creative but not adverse to rote-learning.\nIndeed, they can use us.\nBut the \"Model Minority\" is a tease.\nWe know you are watching now,\nso we refuse to give you any!\nOh, bamboo shoots, bamboo shoots!\nThe further west we go, we'll hit east;\nthe deeper down we dig, we'll find China.\nHistory has turned its stomach\non a black polluted beach--\nwhere life doesn't hinge\non that red, red wheelbarrow,\nbut whether or not our new lover\nin the final episode of \"Santa Barbara\"\nwill lean over a scented candle\nand call us a \"bitch.\"\nOh God, where have we gone wrong?\nWe have no inner resources!\n\n*\n\nThen, one redolent spring morning\nthe Great Patriarch Chin\npeered down from his kiosk in heaven\nand saw that his descendants were ugly.\nOne had a squarish head and a nose without a bridge\nAnother's profile--long and knobbed as a gourd.\nA third, the sad, brutish one\nmay never, never marry.\nAnd I, his least favorite--\n\"not quite boiled, not quite cooked,\"\na plump pomfret simmering in my juices--\ntoo listless to fight for my people's destiny.\n\"To kill without resistance is not slaughter\"\nsays the proverb.So, I wait for imminent death.\nThe fact that this death is also metaphorical\nis testament to my lethargy.\n\n*\n\nSo here lies Marilyn Mei Ling Chin,\nmarried once, twice to so-and-so, a Lee and a Wong,\ngranddaughter of Jack \"the patriarch\"\nand the brooding Suilin Fong,\ndaughter of the virtuous Yuet Kuen Wong\nand G.G. Chin the infamous,\nsister of a dozen, cousin of a million,\nsurvived by everbody and forgotten by all.\nShe was neither black nor white,\nneither cherished nor vanquished,\njust another squatter in her own bamboo grove\nminding her poetry--\nwhen one day heaven was unmerciful,\nand a chasm opened where she stood.\nLike the jowls of a mighty white whale,\nor the jaws of a metaphysical Godzilla,\nit swallowed her whole.\nShe did not flinch nor writhe,\nnor fret about the afterlife,\nbut stayed!Solid as wood, happily\na little gnawed, tattered, mesmerized\nby all that was lavished upon her\nand all that was taken away!"}
