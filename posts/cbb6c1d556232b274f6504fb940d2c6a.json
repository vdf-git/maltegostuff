{"subject": "He Giveth His Beloved Sleep", "text": "Across the sleeper's dreamless rest,\nThe chills of death like shadows creep;\nBut pillowed on the Saviour's breast,\nHe giveth His beloved sleep.\n\nPeace, troubled ocean of despair!\nBe still, thou ever raging deep!\nFrom life's brief day of pain and care,\nHe giveth His beloved sleep.\n\nOver the cradle of her child,\nLove doth her sleepless vigil keep;\nWhile life's dark storm beats loud and wild,\nHe giveth His beloved sleep.\n\nQuenched is the flame of mortal breath,\nCalm is the creature born to weep;\nOh peaceful rest, this is not death!\nHe giveth His beloved sleep."}
