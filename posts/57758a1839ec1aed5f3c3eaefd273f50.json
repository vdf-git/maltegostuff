{"subject": "Hymn I: O For A Thousand Tongues To Sing", "text": "O for a thousand tongues to sing\nMy great Redeemer's praise,\nThe glories of my God and King,\nThe triumphs of his grace! \n\nMy gracious Master and my God,\nAssist me to proclaim,\nTo spread through all the earth abroad\nThe honours of thy name. \n\nJesus! the name that charms our fears,\nThat bids our sorrows cease;\n'Tis music in the sinner's ears,\n'Tis life, and health, and peace. \n\nHe breaks the power of cancelled sin,\nHe sets the prisoner free;\nHis blood can make the foulest clean,\nHis blood availed for me. \n\nHe speaks, and, listening to his voice,\nNew life the dead receive,\nThe mournful, broken hearts rejoice,\nThe humble poor believe. \n\nHear him, ye deaf; his praise, ye dumb,\nYour loosened tongues employ;\nYe blind, behold your Saviour come,\nAnd leap, ye lame, for joy. \n\nLook unto him, ye nations, own\nYour God, ye fallen race;\nLook, and be saved through faith alone,\nBe justified by grace. \n\nSee all your sins on Jesus laid:\nThe Lamb of God was slain,\nHis soul was once an offering made\nFor every soul of man. \n\nAwake from guilty nature's sleep,\nAnd Christ shall give you light,\nCast all your sins into the deep,\nAnd wash the \u00c6thiop white. \n\nWith me, your chief, ye then shall know,\nShall feel your sins forgiven;\nAnticipate your heaven below,\nAnd own that love is heaven."}
