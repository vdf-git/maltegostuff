{"subject": "A Mother", "text": "It rained all day the day she died,\nAnd yet she thought it sweet and fair;\nShe said the sunlight kissed her hair,\nAnd then she slept, all satisfied.\n\nIt rained all day; she woke again,\nAnd whispered that the sky was blue.\nAh me! thank God she never knew\nHow cold and dreary fell the rain.\n\nSo like her life! It rained all day,\nAnd yet she thought it all was bright;\nShe loved and toiled through day and night--\nShe never thought the skies were gray."}
