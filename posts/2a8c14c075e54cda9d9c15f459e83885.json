{"subject": "Finis", "text": "An idle rhyme of the summer time, \n Sweet, and solemn, and tender; \nFair with the haze of the moon's pale rays, \n Bright with the sunset's splendour.\n\nSummer and beauty over the lands -\n Careless hours of pleasure; \nA meeting of eyes and a touching of hands -\n A change in the floating measure.\n\nA deeper hue in the skies of blue, \n Winds from the tropics blowing; \nA softer grace in the fair moons face, \n And the summer going, going.\n\nThe leaves drift down, the green grows brown, \n And tears with smiles are blended; \nA twilight hour and a treasured flower, -\n And now the poem is ended."}
