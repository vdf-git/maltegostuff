{"subject": "Sonnet Xxiii: The Curious Wits", "text": "The curious wits seeing dull pensiveness \nBewray itself in my long settled eyes, \nWhence those same fumes of melancholy rise, \nWith idle pains, and missing aim, do guess. \n\nSome that know how my spring I did address, \nDeem that my Muse some fruit of knowledge plies: \nOthers, because the Prince my service tries, \nThink that I think state errors to redress. \n\nBut harder judges judge ambition's rage, \nScourge of itself, still climbing slipp'ry place, \nHolds my young brain cativ'd in golden cage. \n\nOh Fools, or over-wise, alas the race \nOf all my thoughts hath neither stop nor start, \nBut only Stella's eyes and Stella's heart."}
