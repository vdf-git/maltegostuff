{"subject": "A Valediction: Forbidding Mourning", "text": "As virtuous men pass mildly away,\n     And whisper to their souls, to go,\nWhilst some of their sad friends do say,\n     'The breath goes now,' and some say, 'No:'\n\nSo let us melt, and make no noise,\n    No tear-floods, nor sigh-tempests move;\n'Twere profanation of our joys\n    To tell the laity our love.\n\nMoving of th' earth brings harms and fears;\n    Men reckon what it did, and meant;\nBut trepidation of the spheres,\n    Though greater far, is innocent.\n\nDull sublunary lovers' love\n    (Whose soul is sense) cannot admit\nAbsence, because it doth remove\n    Those things which elemented it.\n\nBut we by a love so much refin'd,\n    That ourselves know not what it is,\nInter-assured of the mind,\n    Care less, eyes, lips, and hands to miss.\n\nOur two souls therefore, which are one,\n    Though I must go, endure not yet\nA breach, but an expansion,\n    Like gold to airy thinness beat.\n\nIf they be two, they are two so\n    As stiff twin compasses are two;\nThy soul, the fix'd foot, makes no show\n    To move, but doth, if the' other do.\n\nAnd though it in the centre sit,\n    Yet when the other far doth roam,\nIt leans, and hearkens after it,\n    And grows erect, as that comes home.\n\nSuch wilt thou be to me, who must\n    Like th' other foot, obliquely run;\nThy firmness makes my circle just,\n    And makes me end, where I begun."}
