{"subject": "Lord Of Unnumbered Hopes", "text": "Lord of unnumbered hopes, unnumbered prayers,\n    Immaculate dream, unknown, unknowable\n    To mortal sense save dimly through the spell\nOf earth's delights and quickening despairs,\nForgive what we have been, and what we are,\n    For that which in Time's fullness we shall be! \n    Thou art the Light, and in Thy shadow we\nMove in our pathways like a growing star.\n\nMake grow our comprehension till we see\nThrough life's bewildering complexity\nThe touch by which inscrutably is wrought\nThy will: and shape each word, each act, each thought,\n    Until we learn to read Thy will aright\n    And pass from shadow to Eternal Light."}
