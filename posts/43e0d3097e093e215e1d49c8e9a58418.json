{"subject": "The Dog", "text": "Of all the speechless friends of man\nThe faithful dog I deem\nDeserving from the human clan\nThe tenderest esteem:\nThis feeling creature form'd to love,\nTo watch, and to defend,\nWas given to man by powers above,\nA guardian, and a friend!\nI sing, of all e'er known to live\nThe truest friend canine;\nAnd glory if my verse may give,\nBrave Fido! it is thine.\nA dog of many a sportive trick,\nTho' rough and large of limb.\nFido would chase the floating stick\nWhen Lucy cried, 'go swim.'\nAnd what command could Lucy give,\nHer dog would not obey?\nFor her it seemed his pride to live,\nBlest in her gentle sway!\nFor conscious of her every care\nHe strain'd each feeling nerve,\nTo please that friend, his lady fair\nCommanded him to serve.\nOf many friends to Lucy dear,\nOne rose above the rest;\nProclaim'd, in glory's bright career,\nThe monarch of her breast.\nTender and brave, her Edward came\nTo bid his fair adieu;\nTo India call'd, in honour's name,\nTo honour he was true.\nThe farewell rack'd poor Lucy's heart,\nNor pain'd her lover less;\nAnd Fido, when he saw them part,\nSeem'd full of their distress.\nLucy, who thro' her tears descried\nHis sympathetic air,\n'Go! with him, Fido!' fondly cried,\n'And make his life thy care!'\nThe dog her order understood,\nOr seem'd to understand,\nIt was his glory to make good\nAffection's kind command.\nHow he obeyed;-the price how great\nHis brave obedience cost,\nFancy would faulter to relate,\nIn wild conjecture lost.\nBut Truth and Love, the upright pair,\nWho witnessed Fido's worth,\nHis wond'rous virtue shall declare,\nA lesson to the earth!\nNot in the battle's gory tide,\nNor in the stormy seas,\nNo! Fido's noble faith was tried\nIn scenes of sportive ease.\nOften in India's sultry soil\nTo brace the languid limb,\n'Twas Edward's pleasure, after toil,\nTo take a fearless swim.\nBold in a flood he lov'd to leap,\nWhen full the current flow'd;\nNor dreamt the water, dark, and deep,\nThe crocodile's abode.\nAnd fearless he and Fido oft,\nAlong the stream would glide;\nTheir custom from the bank aloft\nTo vault into the tide!\nBut once, when Edward had begun\nTo cast his clothes aside,\nRound him his dog would anxious run,\nAnd much to check him tried.\nSo much, that had dumb Fido said\n'Avoid the stream to day!'\nThose words could scarce have plainer made\nWhat duty wish'd to say.\nEdward, too eager to enjoy\nThe sport, where danger lay,\nScolds him for gestures, that annoy,\nAnd beats his guard away:\nAnd naked now, and dreaming not\nHow cruel was that blow,\nHe hurries to the lofty spot,\nIn haste to plunge below,\nHis faithful friend, with quicker pace,\nAnd now with silent tongue,\nOut-stript his master in the race,\nAnd swift before him sprung.\nHeaven! how the heart of Edward swell'd\nUpon the river's brink,\nWhen his brave guardian he beheld\nA glorious victim sink!\nSink in a watery monster's jaw,\nThat near the river's side\nToo late th' astonish'd Edward saw,\nAnd shriek'd, as Fido died.\nIn vain he shriek'd; and soon his tears\nHis heart-felt loss deplore;\n'Lucy!' he cries, as if she hears,\n'Thy Fido is no more!'\n'Calamitously lost, his form,\n'So often thy delight!\n'No artist's hand, with genius warm,\n'Can rescue for thy sight;\n'But if 'tis sung by friendly bard\n'How he resign'd his breath;\n'Thy dog must win the world's regard,\n'Immortal in his death!'\n'Twas thus the feeling Edward griev'd,\nNor could his grief divine,\nWhat honours, by pure love conceived,\nBrave Fido, would be thine!\nWhen Lucy heard of Fido's fate,\nWhat showers of tears she shed!\nNo cost would she have thought too great\nTo celebrate the dead.\nBut gold had not the power to raise\nA semblance of her friend;\nYet kind compassion, who surveys,\nSoon bids her sorrow end.\nA sculptor, pity's genuine son!\nKnew her well-founded grief;\nAnd quickly, tho' he promised none,\nGave her the best relief;\nHe, rich in Lucy's sister's heart,\nBy love and friendship's aid,\nOf Fido, with the happiest art,\nA secret statue made.\nBy stealth in Lucy's chamber plac'd,\nIt charm'd the mourner there,\n'Till Edward, with new glory grac'd,\nRejoin'd his faithful fair.\nThe marble Fido in their sight,\nEnhanc'd their nuptial bliss;\nAnd Lucy every morn, and night,\nGave him a grateful kiss."}
