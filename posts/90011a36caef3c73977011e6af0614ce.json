{"subject": "Thoughts At A Vestibule", "text": "Here's a vestibule. On holidays\nOvercome by slavish fear,\nThe whole population, in a state of awe,\nRushes to the sacred doors.\nHaving left their names and ranks.\nAll these visitors return then to their homes\nThey are all so deeply satisfied \nYou might think this was their calling!\nYet on other days this ornate vestibule\nIs beset by much more wretched sorts:\nSchemers and position-seekers,\nBy a widow and an aged man.\nTo and fro each morning without cease \nCouriers bustle with their papers.\nSome returning seekers whistle a tune\nWhile some others walk and weep.\nOnce I saw some peasants who stopped by,\nSimple Russian villagers.\nHaving crossed themselves they stood aside\nAnd they hung their flaxen heads.\nThen up came a doorman.-\"Let us in,\" they said\nWith a look of torment and of hope.\nHe surveyed the visitors: how ugly they all looked.\nSunburned hands and faces  \nThreadbare coats upon their backs,\nOn bent shoulders knapsacks,\nCrosses round the neck and bloodied feet\nShod in hand-made bast\n(Must have come from far away,\nFrom some far-flung province).\nSomeone yelled out to the doorman: \"Send them off!\nOur boss doesn't care for ragged mobs!\"\nAnd the door was shut.  In time\nThey untied their bags\nBut the doorman spurned their meager offerings\nAnd they walked off through the burning sun,\nSaying: God will be the judge!\nWith their arms thrown wide in consternation,\nI observed them 'til they disappeared,\nAnd they never donned their caps.\n\nWhile the owner of this lavish palace\nWas still nestled in deep sleep's embrace . . .\nYou who think so highly of a life\nFull of thrilling, shameless flattery,\nGluttony, philandering and play,\nWake now! There's a greater pleasure:\nCall them back. For you are their salvation!\nBut the sated are to goodness deaf.\n\nHeavenly thunder doesn't frighten you,\nEarthly thunders you hold in your hands\nThat is why these unknown men must carry\nGrief disconsolate within their hearts.\n\nBut what does this desperate sorrow mean to you?\nWhat do you care for these desperate folk?\nA life racing by in endless holidays\nKeeps you from awakening.\nAnd why care? For you the people's good\nIs an idle game for scribblers;\nYou will live a glorious life without it\nAnd you'll die a glorious death!\nYour declining days will pass\nPeacefully like some Arcadian idyll:\nUnder Sicily's charming skies,\nIn the fragrant shade of trees,\nContemplating crimson suns\nAs they sink into the azure sea\nCasting shining rays of gold,-\nLulled by the soft melody\nOf Tyrrhenean waves-just like a child\nYou will slumber, satisfied in every need \nBy your dear and loving family\n(Who await your death impatiently);\nYour remains they'll transport back to us\nTo reward them with a funeral feast.\nLike a hero you'll be lowered to the grave,\nBy your homeland silently cursed,\nGlorified by boisterous praise! . . .\n\nStill, why bother such a personage\nWith the pains of trivial folk?\nRage at them instead-a great idea! \nIt's less dangerous. . . and more amusing,\nFind ourselves some kind of solace . . .\nWhat a peasant bears is no big deal:\nIt's what fate that guides us\nHas decreed . . . And anyway, he's used to it!\nIn some lowly inn outside the city gates,\nThese poor men will drink their final rubles down\nAnd then head for home, begging all the way,\nMoaning humbly . . . O my homeland!\nTell me now of some abode-\nI have surely never seen it-\nWhere your sower and your guardian,\nThe meek Russian peasant, does not moan?\nIn the fields he moans, and on the roads,\nIn the prisons and stockades he moans,\nAnd in ore mines, wearing iron chains;\nMoans burst out from barns and stacks of hay,\nAnd from carts where he sleeps in the steppe;\nIn his own poor hut he moans,\nWarmed by nothing on God's earth;\nIn each godforsaken town he moans,\nIn the vestibules of courts and palaces as well.\nGo out to the Volga: hear whose moan \nRises over Russia's greatest river?\nIn our land, this moan is called a song-\nIt's the boatmen straining in their traces! . .\nVolga! Volga! In the spring your torrents\nCannot flood the fields as much\nAs our people's awful pain  \nFloods our land-\nWhere you are there's moaning-O, my people!\nWhat can all this endless moaning mean?\nWill you ever waken, filled with strength,\nOr, obeying fate's command,\nHave you done all that you can,\nFashioning a song so like a moan,\nWhile your soul remains forever mired in sleep?.."}
