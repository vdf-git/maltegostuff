{"subject": "The False Laurel And The True", "text": "'What art thou, Presumptuous, who profanest\nThe wreath to mighty poets only due,\nEven whilst like a forgotten moon thou wanest?\nTouch not those leaves which for the eternal few\nWho wander o'er the Paradise of fame, \nIn sacred dedication ever grew:\nOne of the crowd thou art without a name.'\n'Ah, friend, 'tis the false laurel that I wear;\nBright though it seem, it is not the same\nAs that which bound Milton\u2019s immortal hair; \nIts dew is poison; and the hopes that quicken\nUnder its chilling shade, though seeming fair,\nAre flowers which die almost before they sicken.'"}
