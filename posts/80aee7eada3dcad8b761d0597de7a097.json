{"subject": "Man's Problem And It's Solution", "text": "Man's basic problem can be clearly shown \nHe feasts on forces which he did not earn \nHe thinks the world was made for him alone \nHe has not learned yet how to really learn That natural self which simply drifts along \nTasting pleasure as it comes while shunning pain \nHe does not know that he is really very blind \nAlas he lives his life in shadows almost in vain He does not know that he is mostly fast asleep \nHe drifts through life surrounded by a foggy haze \nThe only time he wakens just a little bit \nIs when the pain and fear may sharpen up his gaze He does not know that pain and fear are valued gifts \nThat could lift from him the shroud of everlasting nights \nWhen men draws near to them intentionally to learn \nThe darkness lifts and makes the day turn clear and bright The crafty foxes tell him that he has been robbed \nBy all the flowing ages which have somehow gone amiss \nThey tell him that he should demand his human dues \nAnd take for absolutely nothing what is really his The natural self is tempted by the wily tempter's tongue \nBy all of those who's plan it is to take control \nWhen order's gone and mischief finally rules the world \nIn the tempter's kingdom he will find himself a slave enrolled To know, the natural self must first be firmly stopped \nBy someone who is patient, and yet bold and very wise \nA mighty hunter of the truth who's surely paid his dues \nAnd not a callous tyrant as a godly saint disguised For when the natural self is surely stopped at last \nThat moment dawns, the truth is clearly seen \nA world of forces which from all demands respect \nNo more the careless playground that it's been For when the natural self is really stopped \nIt's natural for him to submit and bow his head \nOnce stopped he learns to start himself and earn his way \nThe basic words within the book of life are finally read Yes when the natural self is thus so wisely stopped \nAnd meekly bows unto a mighty and mysterious world \nThe soul is launched upon a grand and Godly course \nThe flag of truth at last is flown high, unfurled From out that matrix which thus newly formed \nThe soul in triumph rises, shining beaming bright \nThe spirit acts to make the two become as one \nA mind and body which are filled with cosmic light So pour yourself into the mould of truth \nAnd let your light so freely shine and grow \nThat in a somber world of darkness and despair \nThere will be some who see, and seek to know"}
