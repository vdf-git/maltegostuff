{"subject": "Song #5", "text": "TUNE--'THE LEA RIG.' \n\nWHILE summer laughs in ev'ry grove,\nAnd paints in gayest hues each flower,\nDear charmer, come! my constant love,\nTo share and grace my rural bower:\nThere little birds, in sprightly strain,\nStill chaunt their loves the boughs among;\nWhile there you ramble with your swain,\nThey'll cheer you with their artless song.\nMy garden smiles in fairest dress--\nEach shrub and tree their blooms display;\nWalks, where the meeting boughs embrace,\nWill shield you from the noon-tide ray.\nFor you I've dress'd my little cot,\nIts walls with honeysuckle bound;\nO! come and share my humble lot,\nAnd let my hours with love be crown'd!\nWhen Ev'ning, with her robe of grey,\nClothes Nature in a dusky hue,\nWe'll seek our flocks that homeward stray,\nAnd nip the blade that droops with dew:\nOur sheep we joyfully will pen,\nWith careful hand the fold we'll close;\nThen to our peaceful cot again\nI'll lead you, to invite repose!"}
