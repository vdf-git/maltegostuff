{"subject": "Sonnets To A Friend: Vi", "text": "And thou, in such calm moments, wilt again\n Stand in that holy silent light which swims\n With unsung liturgies and incensed hymns\nThat ever teach us life is light and vain!\nNay, in thy spirit thou wilt walk in awe\n Adown the column'd vista of the nave,\n Till transept, altar, and high architrave\nDeepen and take the universal law\nOf worship. Or wilt thou become as one\n Who hath no motion, and with eyes that seem\n To gaze beyond their light, drink in the mild\nCelestial splendour of our Raphael's dream,\n And steep'd in all the art thou gazest on\u2014\n Half worship the Madonna and her Child!"}
