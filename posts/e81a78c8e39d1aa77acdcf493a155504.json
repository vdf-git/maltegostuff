{"subject": "Parable", "text": "I read how Quixote in his random ride\nCame to a crossing once, and lest he lose\nThe purity of chance, would not decide\n\nWhither to fare, but wished his horse to choose.\nFor glory lay wherever turned the fable.\nHis head was light with pride, his horse's shoes\n\nWere heavy, and he headed for the stable."}
