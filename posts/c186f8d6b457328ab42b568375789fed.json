{"subject": "The Poor Man's Guest", "text": "ONE came to me in royal guise\nWith banners flying fair and free\nBut many griefs had made me wise\nAnd I refused to bow the knee.\n\nThen one drew near who bore the flower\nOf all the flowers of June and May;\nBut many griefs had lent me power\nAnd I was strong to turn away.\n\nThen came a beggar to my gate\nWith shoulders bowed to sorrow's pack,\nSo weary and so desolate\nI had no heart to turn him back.\n\nI let him share my board, my bed,\nI warmed him in my shrinking breast,\nI gave him all I had, and said:\n'You, only you, have been my guest.\n\n'Love passed in many a fair disguise\nBut never could an entrance win,\nBut you came in such piteous wise,\nPoor friend, I could but let you in.'\n\nLow laughed my guest: 'Kind friend!' said he,\nAnd dropped the rags he was weary of;\nAnd I, betrayed, saw over me\nThe terrible face of outraged Love."}
