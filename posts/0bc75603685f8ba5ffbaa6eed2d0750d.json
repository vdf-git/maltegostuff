{"subject": "The Love Sonnets Of Proteus.  Part Iv: Vita Nova: Cviii", "text": "A FOREST IN BOSNIA\nSpirit of Trajan! What a world is here,\nWhat remnant of old Europe in this wood,\nOf life primaeval rude as in the year\nWhen thy first legions by the Danube stood.\nThese are the very Dacians they subdued,\nSwineherds and shepherds clad in skins of deer\nAnd fox and marten still, a bestial brood,\nThan their own swine begotten swinelier.\nThe fair oak--forest, their first heritage,\nPastures them still, and still the hollow oak\nReceives them in its bosom. Still o'erhead\nUpon the stag--head tops, grown hoar with age,\nCalm buzzards sit and ancient ravens croak,\nAnd all with solemn life is tenanted."}
