{"subject": "Spirals", "text": "Spirals fascinate me:\nThey ascend\nBy such gentle gradations.\n\nLittle green spirals\nOf the vine\nThat creep softly- \nThen lay strong hold\nOn stony crevices,\nLifting a great travailing growth\nToward Heaven.\n\nSilver spirals of smoke\nThat carry upward,\nIn visible exhalations\nThe spirit of fire;\nGold tendrils of hair\nThat coil lovingly\nAbout my fingers,\nAnd fasten upon my heart.\n\nMy soul, on its journey,\nTurned by obstacles -  frustrated,\nMoves not directly upward,\nBut by a spiral staircase\nSeeks its path to the stars."}
