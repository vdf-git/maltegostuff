{"subject": "The Birds Of Passage", "text": "Birds, joyous birds of the wandering wing!\nWhence is it ye come with the flowers of spring?\n\u2013'We come from the shores of the green old Nile,\nFrom the land where the roses of Sharon smile,\nFrom the palms that wave thro' the Indian sky,\nFrom the myrrh-trees of glowing Araby. \n\n'We have swept o'er cities in song renown'd,\u2013\nSilent they lie with the deserts round!\nWe have cross'd proud rivers, whose tide hath roll'd\nAll dark with the warrior-blood of old;\nAnd each worn wing hath regain'd its home,\nUnder peasant's roof-tree, or monarch's dome.'\n\nAnd what have ye found in the monarch's dome,\nSince last ye travers'd the blue sea's foam?\n\u2013'We have found a change, we have found a pall,\nAnd a gloom o'ershadowing the banquet's hall,\nAnd a mark on the floor as of life-drops spilt,\u2013\nNought looks the same, save the nest we built!' \n\nOh! joyous birds, it hath still been so;\nThro' the halls of kings doth the tempest go!\nBut the huts of the hamlet lie still and deep,\nAnd the hills o'er their quiet a vigil keep.\u2013\nSay what have ye found in the peasant's cot,\nSince last ye parted from that sweet spot? \n\n'A change we have found there\u2013and many a change!\nFaces, and footsteps, and all things strange!\nGone are the heads of the silvery hair,\nAnd the young that were, have a brow of care,\nAnd the place is hush'd where the children play'd,\u2013\nNought looks the same, save the nest we made!' \n\nSad is your tale of the beautiful earth,\nBirds that o'ersweep it in power and mirth!\nYet thro' the wastes of the trackless air,\nYe have a Guide, and shall we despair?\nYe over desert and deep have pass'd,\u2013\nSo may we reach our bright home at last!"}
