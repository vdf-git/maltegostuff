{"subject": "Cracked Avenues (Ismene)", "text": "You live in the cracked avenues\narguing and warming a kitchen's generations\nLast year wept but now the harrowed road\n\nMoths eat the library, huffing past\nThe best went flickering through folding birch and sycamore\nLast year was but now the bladed veil\n\nOnce sunset chipped in your hair, farewelling the universe's inhabitants\nNow clouds stop in your frozen cemetery\nyour wine-dark car turning in the drive\nAdvertisement flags serrate the 7-Eleven's pediment, the streetlights set like spoons\nGraves dust the hill and the ruptured gums\nthat whistle your instructions\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nYou take the opal moon for granted\nthe marching cypress, sunset's bolt\nthe street's green strip neon selling food\nat every calamitous funeral red car lights map like lava\nGold kalashnikov's meted sorrow, an orb, a card\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nNew Year's Day shines on next door's brick wall and chimney\nas photos turn the marvellous gardens' First Communion\nwriting your doctorate on the pillow\nwhose chains and sigh have passed\nI pull the hearth rug's Martha and Mary into my caul\n\nA golden hypocrite reassembles in the Arch of Federation\nYou, who were always with me, remember how bright the stars\nabove the ti-tree and eucalypt\n\nWe sat out in the fallen landscape, severed from what was\ncolouring the yard as it had been\nShe says you're running now in the gold paddocks of your youth\nwho never reached her age\nWe lay the falcon china\nAbove, the hilted Southern Cross"}
