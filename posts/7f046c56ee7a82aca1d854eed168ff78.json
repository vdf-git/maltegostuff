{"subject": "The Flooded Hut Of The Mississippi", "text": "On the wide-rolling river, at eve, set the sun,\nAnd the long-toiling day of the woodman was done,\nAnd he flung down the axe that had felled the huge tree,\nAnd his own little daughter he placed on his knee;\nShe looked up, with smiles, at a dovecot o'er head-\nWhere, circling around, flew the pigeons she fed,\nAnd more fondly the sire clasp'd his child to his breast-\nAs he kiss'd her-and called her the bird of his nest.\nThe wide-rolling river rose high in the night,\nThe wide-rolling river, at morn, show'd its might,\nFor it leap'd o'er its bounds, and invaded the wood\nWhere the humble abode of the wood-cutter stood.\nAll was danger around, and no aid was in view,\nAnd higher and higher the wild waters grew,\nAnd the child-looking up at the dovecot in air,\nCried, 'Father-oh father, I wish we were there!'\n'My child,' said the father, 'that dovecot of thine\nShould enliven our faith in the Mercy Divine;\n'Twas a dove that brought Noah the sweet branch of peace,\nTo show him the anger of Heaven did cease:\nThen kneel, my lov'd child, by thy fond father's side,\nAnd pray that our hut may in safety abide,\nAnd then, from all fear may our bosoms be proof-\nWhile the dove of the deluge is over our roof.'"}
