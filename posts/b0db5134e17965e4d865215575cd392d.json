{"subject": "Epilogue To The 'Good Natur'D Man'", "text": "As puffing quacks some caitiff wretch procure\nTo swear the pill, or drop, has wrought a cure;\nThus on the stage, our play-wrights still depend\nFor Epilogues and Prologues on some friend,\nWho knows each art of coaxing up the town, \nAnd make full many a bitter pill go down.\nConscious of this, our bard has gone about,\nAnd teas'd each rhyming friend to help him out.\n'An Epilogue - things can't go on without it;\nIt could not fail, would you but set about it.' \n'Young man,' cries one - a bard laid up in clover -\n'Alas, young man, my writing days are over;\nLet boys play tricks, and kick the straw; not I:\nYour brother Doctor there, perhaps, may try.'\n'What I? dear Sir,' the Doctor interposes \n'What plant my thistle, Sir, among his roses!\nNo, no; I've other contests to maintain;\nTo-night I head our troops at Warwick Lane:\nGo, ask your manager.' 'Who, me? Your pardon;\nThose things are not our forte at Covent Garden.' \nOur Author's friends, thus plac'd at happy distance,\nGive him good words indeed, but no assistance.\nAs some unhappy wight, at some new play,\nAt the Pit door stands elbowing a way,\nWhile oft, with many a smile, and many a shrug, \nHe eyes the centre, where his friends sit snug;\nHis simp'ring friends, with pleasure in their eyes,\nSink as he sinks, and as he rises rise;\nHe nods, they nod; he cringes, they grimace;\nBut not a soul will budge to give him place. \nSince then, unhelp'd, our bard must now conform\n'To 'bide the pelting of this pitiless storm' -\nBlame where you must, be candid where you can;\nAnd be each critic the 'Good Natur'd Man'."}
