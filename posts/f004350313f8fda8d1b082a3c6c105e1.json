{"subject": "The Elm Trees Of Maine", "text": "The Elm trees by the river\n Are a lot like Gothic Arches\n I saw in France with Lillian\n Except each limo is different\n And the arches form feather top\n Against the grey clouds lowered\n Over Wyto itlock\n Before the Mosquitoes come.\n Of course the leaves haven't had a chance\n To sprout and demonstrate their colors.\n The Elms won't last though,\n In contrast to the Arches;\n Because the Dutch Disease has killed them.\n So they hang there by their hair\n Waiting for the End or for the\n State of Maine to cut them down."}
