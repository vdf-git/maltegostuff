{"subject": "Betrayal", "text": "I\nStrange, that the race relinquish to the hands,\nMailed and relentless, of the haughty few\nIts destinies! The pomps Assyria knew\nMoan to the twilight of the bitter sands\nWith lips of stone, and in the desert stands\nNo record of the millions that she slew.\nThere gleams no throne in Time's august review\nBut sent a sword upon the patient lands.\n\nOn Europe now, as once on Babylon,\nThe vulture bands go forth beneath the sun,\nAnd ravens hover at the flanks of war\nWith clamor echoless and desolate,\nAs tho each bird cried hoarsely to its mate,\n'The kings are at their bloody work once more!'\n\nII\n\nWhy will ye suffer it, and give to kings\nThe reins of government, O brothers blind?\nUpon their roads of empire ye shall find\nDespair and agony and shattered things.\nTheir suns conspire; the throne's deep shadow swings\nIts midnight on the race's heart and mind;\nYour homes they open to the rain and wind,\nYour portals to the bat's familiar wings.\n\nTheir feet take hold on Hell, and on their path\nLie Beauty violate and Love profaned;\nTheir armies trample and their chariots ride\nOn harvests and the hearth-stone, and your wrath\nWakes not, nor hath your purblind strength arraigned\nTheir idiot 'honor' and insensate pride!"}
