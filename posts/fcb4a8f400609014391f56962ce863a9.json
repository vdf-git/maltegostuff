{"subject": "Washing The Dishes", "text": "WHEN we on simple rations sup \nHow easy is the washing up! \nBut heavy feeding complicates \nThe task by soiling many plates.\n\nAnd though I grant that I have prayed \nThat we might find a serving-maid, \nI'd scullion all my days I think, \nTo see Her smile across the sink!\n\nI wash, she wipes. In water hot \nI souse each pan and dish and pot; \nWhile taffy mutters, purrs, and begs, \nAnd rubs himself against my legs.\nThe man who never in his life \nHas washed the dishes with his wife \nOr polished up the silver plate- \nHe still is largely celibate.\n\nOne warning: there is certain ware \nThat must be handled with all care: \nThe Lord Himself will give you up \nIf you should drop a willow cup!"}
