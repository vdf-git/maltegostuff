{"subject": "Poetry Is A Minorized Language", "text": "I shall begin with its density. Its acidity, its ph.\n\nIt walks just like a woman:\nbetween the massacre of the invisible\nand the concentration camp of visibility.\n\nIt barks style and goals,\nan hospitable epic.\n\nIn the poem, language\ndeafens ears to itself;\nin it, words expand\ntheir circles of friendship.\n\nThe alphabet must be masturbated\nuntil it babbles apparently\nunrelated things.\n\nShifting gears in speech,\ngestures from another order.\nThe mosquito's smile within the amber stone.\n\nIt is not that you don't understand Arabic.\nYou don't understand\n\npoetry.\n\nTranslation: Lawrence Schimel"}
