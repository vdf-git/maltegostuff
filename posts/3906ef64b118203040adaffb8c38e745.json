{"subject": "Ebony Life", "text": "A frightening stillness will mark that day\nAnd the shadow of streetlights and fire-alarms will exhaust the light\nAll things, the quietest and the loudest, will be silent\nThe suckling brats will die\nThe tugboats the locomotives the wind will glide by in silence\nWe will hear the great voice which coming from far away will pass over the city\nWe will wait a long time for it\nThen at the rich man's time of day\nWhen the dust the stones the missing tears\nform the sun's robe on the huge deserted squares\nWe shall finally hear the voice.\nIt will growl at doors for a long while\nIt will pass over the town tearing up flags and breaking windowpanes.\nWe will hear it\nWhat silence before it, but still greater the silence\nit will not disturb but will hold guilty will brand and denounce\nDay of sorrows and joys\nThe day the day to come when the voice will pass over the city\nA ghostly seagull told me she loved me as much as I loved her\nThat this great terrible silence was my love\nThat the wind carrying the voice was the great revolt of the world\nAnd that the voice would look kindly on me."}
