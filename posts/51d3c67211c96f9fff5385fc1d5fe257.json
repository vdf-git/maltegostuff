{"subject": "Success", "text": "This I would claim for my success\u2014not fame nor gold,\nNor the throng's changing cheers from day to day,\nNot always ease and fortune's glad display,\nThough all of these are pleasant joys to hold;\nBut I would like to have my story told\nBy smiling friends with whom I've shared the way,\nWho, thinking of me, nod their heads and say:\n'His heart was warm when other hearts were cold.\n'None turned to him for aid and found it not,\nHis eyes were never blind to man's distress,\nYouth and old age he lived, nor once forgot\nThe anguish and the ache of loneliness;\nHis name was free from stain or shameful blot\nAnd in his friendship men found happiness.'"}
