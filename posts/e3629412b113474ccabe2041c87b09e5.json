{"subject": "Scissors", "text": "This thing lying on the desk is now being seen by my eyes. I could\npick it up at this moment. I could cut out a human figure with it. I might\neven cut off all my hair. Though it's understood that murder is out of\nthe question.\n\nYet this thing also keeps getting rustier, blunter, and older. It's still\nuseful but it'll be thrown away before long. Although I have no way\nof knowing whether it's made of ore from Chile or whether Krupp's\nfingers have touched it, it's not hard to imagine that it will finally return\nto its indeterminate destiny, moving away from its human formality\nback to its original state. this thing here on the desk is at this moment\ntalking about such a time, not to anyone in particular but coldly, silently,\nas if it were not doing that. People manufactured this for practical\npurposes and yet it has inevitably come to exist here in this way before\nand apart from any practical purpose it might have. It's something which\ncould be variously named -  not just 'scissors.' It already has countless\nother names. Habit alone keeps me from using the other names. Or is\nit out of self-defence?\n\nBecause this thing, existing like this, has the power to extract words\nfrom me so that I go on being unreeled in this string of words and am\nalways on the dangerous verge of being reduced to a far more thinner\nand feebler existence than that of the scissors.\n\n(Translated by William I.
