{"subject": "Sonet 92", "text": "Whil'st carelesse swimming in thy beauties seas,\nI wondring was at that bewitching grace,\nThou painted pitie on a cruell face,\nAnd angled so my iudgement by mine eyes:\nBut now begun to triumph in my scorne,\nWhen I cannot retire my steps againe,\nThou arm'st thine eyes with enuy and disdaine,\nTo murther my abortiue hopes half borne:\nWhil'st like to end this long continued strife,\nMy palenesse shewes I perish in despaire;\nThou loth to lose one that esteemes thee faire,\nWith some sweete word or looke prolongst my life:\nAnd so each day in doubt redact'st my state,\nDeare do not so, once either loue or hate."}
