{"subject": "A Prayer For Louise", "text": "Those piercing cries of anguish, \n\"What are they doing to me?\" \nA small prison cell alone, \n\"My Dad don't leave me here.\" Vulnerable, sensitive, affectionate: \nTrapped in raging turbulent oceans \nOf evidence and talk, . . . and \nIncomprehensible notions. A vital courageous human life \nTo cherish not condemn. \nPray that soon the wounds may heal \nWhen she is home again."}
