{"subject": "The Qualities Of Things", "text": "I keep freedom under my belt, I say, this is for the little people.\nWith a taunt and shallow plush smile, I have read a book that will keep\noranges that bright aluminum and poets amongst trucks fretting\nin that neighborly way. He might say,\nyou are looking for a stray dog beneath straw light.\nI, however, want to hold up a candle in a philosopher's coat \nand with a beard to scratch,\naccount for all misguided phantoms in the shadow, carry a silver buckle\nand a manly fat stomach, salute the orange grove, and ask the marines.\nWith freedom under your belt, he might say, the stench is wicked,\nthe dogs are wicked this time of night. I bar the door. He rubs his eyes.\nWe have never seen geese as white this early.\nThe quantitative methods for business are sung out the window in late spring\nwhen one receives letters and packages, \nidentifies the neighbors dog with a smile.\nWe leave a note to the traffic cop, this an imagined car, it is a shiny bright red.\nThere are lilies near the park. The woman laughs who so dearly wants\nthe woods to be a deep thicket, a blue night.\nPaper work is not for the survivors, it is for the hunter, lifting the pen to\nthe prey, down after the kill. I am willing to sacrifice only the little of the\nremainder of ink,\npersistence is for the cute animal, the cat, or the stuffed bear.\nManufactured, I send you little of me, I do not take pleasure in busy tasks.\nI tremble. You are a ghost. I ask you, what can a dollar bill mean\nto a pack of jackals in early autumn or spring or what have you."}
