{"subject": "Visible Sound", "text": "Aye, have we not felt it and known,\nEre Science proclaimed it her own,\nThat form is but visible tone?\nBehold, where in silence was drowned\nThe last fleeting echo of sound,\nThe rainbow-its blossom-is found;\nWhile anon, with a verdurous sweep\nFrom the mountain-side, wooded and steep,\nSwells the chorus of deep unto deep,\nThat the trumpet flowers, flame-flashing, blow\nTill the lilies enkindled below\nSwoon pale into passion, like snow!\nYea, Love, of sweet Nature the Lord,\nHath fashioned each manifold chord\nTo utter His visible Word,\nWhose work, wheresoever begun,\nLike the rays floating back to the Sun,\nIn the soul of all beauty is one."}
